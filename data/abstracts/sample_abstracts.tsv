KMT2A rearranged (KMT2Ar) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a high-risk genomic subtype, with long-term survival rates of less than 60% across all age groups. These cases present a complex clinical challenge, with a high incidence in infants, high-risk clinical features and propensity for aggressive relapse. KMT2A rearrangements are highly pathogenic leukaemic drivers, reflected by the high incidence of KMT2Ar ALL in infants, who carry few leukaemia-associated cooperative mutations. However, transgenic murine models of KMT2Ar ALL typically exhibit long latency and mature or mixed phenotype, and fail to recapitulate the aggressive disease observed clinically. Next-generation sequencing has revealed that KMT2Ar ALL also occurs in adolescents and adults, and potentially cooperative genomic lesions such as PI3K-RAS pathway variants are present in KMT2Ar patients of all ages. This review addresses the aetiology of KMT2Ar ALL, with a focus on the cell of origin and mutational landscape, and how genomic profiling of KMT2Ar ALL patients in the era of next-generation sequencing demonstrates that KMT2Ar ALL is a complex heterogenous disease. Ultimately, understanding the underlying biology of KMT2Ar ALL will be important in improving long-term outcomes for these high-risk patients.
CFTR function measurements in intestinal organoids may help to better characterise individual disease expression in F508del homozygous people. Our objective was to study correlations between CFTR function as measured with forskolin-induced swelling in rectal organoids with clinical parameters in adult patients with homozygous F508del mutations.
