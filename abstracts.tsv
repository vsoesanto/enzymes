PAH clearance was carried out in 12 newborns, hospitalized in the infantile resuscitation unit for respiratory distress. 6 of these children weighed less than 2.5 kg, 4 had hyaline membrane disease, 6 had either amniotic abnormalities or transitory tachypnea, 2 were surgical patients: one right diaphragmatic hernia, one post-operative respiratory complication after intervention for neonatal occlusion. In 9 cases the newborn was under controled artificial ventilation associated with PEEP at 5 to 7 cm of water. In all of the cases, the hemodynamic, metabolic and blood gas conditions were normal. A control series of 11 newnorn was carried out in a pediatric unit, the clearance was done without urine samples, the rough value of the figures found varied from 5.5 ml per minute to 30 ml per minute in the respiratory distress series and 16 to 62 ml per minute in the control series. The analysis of these results in rendered difficult by the juxtaposition of several factors: Choice of a reference criterion: body surface area, PAH space, patient's weight theoretical weight of the kidneys. The factor of prematurity. The problem of the date of the investigation in comparison with the date of birth.
GPT types are presented for 150 Norwegian matings, with 454 children,  and 1703 Norwegian mother/child combinations. There were five exceptions to a simple codominant inheritance pattern, all believed to be due to a segregating Gpt-0-allele. Rare phenotypes were encountered in two of the families and in 11 of the mother/child combinations. Compiled family material and mother/child material are presented. No indication of association was found between GPT types and phenotypes within the ABO, Rh, MN, Hp, Gc, C3, PGM1, and ACP1 systems. There is a marked association between EBS-Ogna (epidermolysis bullosa simplex, type Ogna) affection and GPT phenotypes. This reflects the Gpt-EBS1 linkage phase. No evidence was found of association between GPT phenotypes and either nephrological diseases or PKU (phenylketonuria).
ABO and Rho (D) blood groups were studied in  61,023 people receiving medical care at the medical units or blood banks of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social in the metropolitan area in the city of Monterrey, Nuevo León, so as to determine the genetical inheritance patterns that control these blood antigens, and that were used in the stimation of ABO and Rho (D) incompatibility in married couples and in births with maternal fetal incompatibility. It was found that IMSS populations, regardless of the medical units, can be considered as part of the same one and are different to those observed in blood banks. From the married couples, 28.58 percent were found to be incompatible with ABO and 7.15 percent with Rho (D); in 2.04 percent of cases, maternal fetal incompatibility had a ratio of 15.63 percent in the ABO group and 5.60 percent in the Rho (D) group. Double incompatibility was found in 0.88 percent of cases. The importance of these facts is stressed, considered as significant data for neonatologists and for those working in maternal fetal isoimmunization clinics.
G6PD isozyme variation in Drosophila melanogaster is investigated in the larval stage through electrophoretic and genetic analyses. As current structural models for this gene-enzyme system fail to apply in these laboratory populations, the authors suggest a regulatory hypothesis to explain their observations.
"APRT deficiency, a new cause of supposed ""uric acid"" stones in young children may be benign or life threatening. This stresses the importance of early recognition and diagnosis. The renal failure, severe in some instances, is preventable because 2,8-DHA formation, the precipitating factor in all, may be controlled by allopurinol preferably without alkali. A low purine diet is advised. ""Uric acid"" stones in children should always be subjected to sophisticated analysis, and regarded with suspicion in young adults. Diagnosis from red cell APRT activity will be impossible in transfused subjects."
ABO and Rh (D--,dd) phenotype frequencies and gene frequencies are reported on 1547 pregnant women from different populations in the Outer Hebrides. There was significant heterogeneity of ABO gene frequencies in the Isle of Lewis, but not in or between other populations. More heterogeneity was apparent at the Rh locus, significant amounts being present between the populations of rural Lewis, between Lewis and Harris and between Lewis, Harris and the combined populations of North and South Uist, Benbecula and Barra. There was no evidence of heterogeneity due to religion in Benbecula or South Uist. Data on exogamy and endogamy suggest that migration between the various populations has been at a level sufficient to prevent or correct any tendency to genetic diversification. It is suggested tentatively that the heterogeneity observed may be the result of the massive emigration from the islands which has occurred over the last 150 years.
IDS inhibits DNA synthesis and mitosis of L cells only when present during the late G1 phase of the cell cycle, as shown with L cells synchronized by a variety of methods. This corresponds well with earlier findings that IDS inhibits DNA synthesis in mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes when present between 16 and 24 h after adding mitogen. In both cell types, the inhibition produced by IDS appears to be totally the result of elevation of cAMP level. Thus, inhibitors of cAMP phosphodiesterase work synergistically with IDS, and activators of cAMP phosphodiesterase overcome the inhibition by IDS. This paper shows that IDS raises cAMP levels in L cells only within a narrow interval of the cell cycle, around 6-8 h after mitosis. This cell cycle specificity, which may be related to appearance of receptors for IDS only at discrete times, may be important in limiting IDS action to suppression, as elevated cAMP levels have a variety of other effects during other phases of the cell cycle.
ACE activity of the serum of 52 normal pregnant women was measured in vitro under conditions of substrate saturation with Hip-His-Leu as substrate. The product His-Leu was measured by fluorimetry after reaction with o-phthaldehyde. ACE activity (nmol/min/ml serum) was 30.6 +/- 7.8, 28.8 +/- 7.4, and 30.9 +/- 8.2 for the first, second, and third trimester of pregnancy, respectively. No statistically significant differences (p greater than 0.05) in ACE activity were detected among the three trimesters of normal pregnancy with either serum volume or serum protein as reference value. These values are within the range reported by Friedland and Silverstein13 for 51 male and seven female healthy blood bank donors. We conclude that the evolution of normal pregnancy does not significantly modify the levels of ACE in peripheral blood serum.
ADA policies on licensure encourage states to ease mobility restrictions while maintaining sufficient control to ensure that only qualified individuals provide dental treatment within the state. Many states have had provision to license by credentials for a long time. Licensure by credentials is rapidly replacing reciprocity as an alternate form of licensure. Only four states still participate in what can be termed purely reciprocal licensure agreements. In contrast, 21 states currently offer licensure by credentials. Another trend in licensure in recent years has been increased state participation in regional clinical examination services. Today, 32 states participate in four regional clinical examination services. With the increasing number of states offering licensure by credentials and participating in regional boards, the prospect for increased mobility for dentists appears good.
LCAT activity is impaired in chronic renal failure. Our data show that LCAT activity is restored in successful renal transplant patients. Hence, relationship between kidney and LCAT activity can be postulated, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully clarified.
G6PD activity was determined in liver biopsy specimens from 31 patients (25 men and six women). The G6PD genotype of the patients was determined by carrying out on lysates of their red blood cells quantitative assays of the enzyme and starch-gel electrophoresis. In 21 subjects with normal G6PD activity in red cells, a relatively wide variation of G6PD activity was found in liver extracts. By contrast, in 10 subjects with G6PD deficiency, the activity of the enzyme in liver extracts was always low. The difference between the distribution of liver G6PD activity values of G6PD-normal and G6PD-deficient subjects was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). We conclude that G6PD deficiency of the African type is also expressed in the liver. These findings may have a bearing on hyperibilirubinemia, which cannot be entirely attributed to hemolysis, often encountered in G6PD-deficient patients.
CAT activity was determined in the neurointermediate lobe of the rat's pituitary gland. The level of enzyme activity in the adult rat is of 386.2 +/- 39.1 picomoles/hour/neurointermediate lobe. CAT activity is present in the pituitary gland of the newborn animal and increases with age. In organo-typic cultured neurointermediates lobes CAT decreases progressively and practically disappears after 10 days.
PAH secretion (TPAH) was studied in rats at spontaneously occurring glomerular filtration rate (GFR). At saturated transport, TPAH was found to be correlated to GFR. This relationship was also observed at unsaturated transport where TPAH depends upon the PAH concentration in arterial plasma. However, no significant correlation between TPAH and renal PAH load or renal plasma flow rate was found when the effects of GFR were removed by partial correlation analysis. A dependency of TPAH on GFR explains the correlations found between filtration fraction (FF) and renal PAH extraction (EPAH) or renal tubular PAH extraction fraction (EPAH--FFPAH). Thus, even at low PAH concentration in a. plasma, renal PAH extraction may only be assumed to be constant if the filtration fraction is constant.
ABO blood groups have been examined in a sample of 400 chicken-pox patients and their 383 unaffected siblings from Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India. Subjects of blood group A (and possibly AB) would appear to have a somewhat higher risk than persons with group B and O to develop chicken pox.
ABO blood groups and ABH saliva secretion were investigated in two caste populations, Reddis and Kammas of Southern Andhra Pradesh, and compared with the data of other populations. In ABO gene frequencies, the present series of Reddis and Kammas approach the values from other Andhra caste data. Moderate gene frequency of non-secretor gene in both Reddis and Kammas are noted.
ABO blood groups of Peruvian and Chilean mummies were determined with the agglutination-inhibition method. In Peru all ABO blood groups were found in the period from 3000 B.C. to 1400 A.D.; from this period to 1650 only A and O were seen. In Chile no B or AB was noted either in pre-Columbian or Colonial mummies. This confirms the archeological concept that the Chilean Indian was culturally as well as genetically different from the Peruvian Indian. Further studies using other genetic markers are in order, as well as changing certain preconceived notions on blood groups of American Indians.
CAT for spine and spinal cord studies was carried out in 182 patients aged 7-80 years during 12 months (April 1977 to March 1978) with the EMI body scanner CT 5005. Three methods were used: (1) standard (noncontrast) scanning; (2) the same, with IV contrast enhancement; (3) the same again, after CSF enhancement with Amipaque (computer-assisted myelography). The combined use of Amipaque and CT seems particularly interesting.
ABO blood groups, secretor factor, Rh-factor, and PTC taste ability have been examined in 360 individuals of Bahawalpuri population of Patiala. B and O blood groups are more frequent (44.46% & 31.36% respectively). Frequency of secretors (84.72%) outweighs that of nonsecretors (15.28%). All the individuals have been found to belong to Rh--ve type. High incidence of nontasters (55.55%) has been seen. Genes r, Se, D, and t are found to be most frequent in the population.
ABO and Rh (D) groups of 6403 blood samples were assessed on an 8/9-channel autoanalyser in the Serology Department of the London Hospital; the results were independently checked at the Regional Blood Transfusion Centre, Brentwood, using the routine methods for grouping donor blood. Results of this comparative study are given and instances are described in which anomalous results or incorrect groupings occurred; the possible causes are discussed. The 8/9-channel automated blood group analyser is evaluated in terms of routine hospital laboratory practice.
ABO blood group frequencies of 1000 vitiligo patients were studied and compared with those of blood donors and local population. The relative risk of O was significantly reduced in patients in comparison with blood donors but not with local population. This can possibly be explained by the well-known preference of O group donors in the blood bank. On a review of other studies it was felt that there may not be any real association of ABO blood groups with vitiligo.
GPI deficiency was detected in a three year old girl of Morrocan origin suffering, since birth, from hemolytic anemia. The defective GPI is very thermolabile and migrates on starch gel electrophoresis as a single band with a mobility of 96% of the normal main band. The purification of the patient's GPI resulted in a 16000-fold enriched preparation, free of any other enzyme activity. The yield was 35%. The purified enzyme was very unstable even at low temperature. The kinetic constants of the forward and backward reaction as well as the inhibitory constants of 2,3-DPG and 6-PG do not significantly differ from normal values. The biochemical properties of the patient's GPI indicate a new variant designated type Liége.
PGM3 activity was investigated by means of horizontal starch gel electrophoresis. In the pig of the German Landrace three different phenotypes have been recognized: F, S and FS. Family studies suggest the occurrence of at least two alleles--PGM3F and the PGM3S at an autosomal locus.
COMT activity is present in many animal tissues, but there is no evidence on the presence or the functional role of COMT activity in platelets. The present work reports the results obtained on COMT activity in the individual platelet populations separated by a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. In the young platelet populations the activity is remarkable higher than in the old and light populations. Low values of COMT activity in the old platelets may reflect platelet senescence.
ESD phenotype distribution and allele frequencies in 217 Norwegians and 196 Norwegian Lapps are presented. There is good accordance with Hardy-Weinberg distribution, ESD1 allele frequencies are 0.887 in the Norwegians and 0.872 in the Lapps.
G6PD activity was assayed in 20 Sardinian heterozygotes for G6PD deficiency and related to that of LDH and MDH. One of these heterozygotes showed a deficient phenotype in all her follicles, while the remaining 19 had different proportions of deficient, intermediate, and normal follicles. This is in accordance with a previous estimate. Because of the broad fiducial limits at the 5% level and because of some developmental considerations, this value cannot be interpreted as indicative of the number of primordial cells for scalp epidermis at the time of X-chromosome inactivation, as previously stated. The assay of single hair follicles is, however, a very valuable tool for establishing the role of cell selection in the same or in a different tissue, like peripheral blood.
PGM3 activity was investigated in 150 'Boerbok' goats and 132 Angora goats by means of horizontal starch gel electrophoresis. In 'Boerbok' goats no polymorphism was found. In Angora goats three different phenotypes have been recognized: F, S, and FS. The results suggest the occurrence of two common alleles: PGM3-F and PGM3-S at an autosomal locus with frequencies of 0.6176 and 0.3824, respectively.
"PAH clearance utilizing the standard technique with blood and urine collection was determined in thirty patients affected by various primary or secondary renal diseases. Each of these patients, also had a ""bolus"" infusion of p-aminohyppurate. ""Bolus clearance"" was calculated from the disappearance slope of their blood concentration. The ""bolus clearance"" of PAH correlated well with the standard technique. However ""Bolus PAH clearance"" overestimated the standard technique. This overestimated (236 ml/min) was significant and defined by a regression factor. Reasons are briefly discussed."
ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn without hyperbilirubinemia is described in 17 full-term infants. The erythrocyte characteristics, such as reticulocytosis, microspherocytosis, and positive indirect antiglobulin (Coomb's) test, resembled those in ABO disease with hyperbilirubinemia. Erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase activity was reduced in this group to the same degree as in the more severely affected infants. Negro infants predominated over white, in a 2.5:1 ratio in this mild ABO group.
GPT phenotype determinations were performed in 4,148 unrelated Norwegians. The frequencies of the two common alleles were Gpt1 = 0.537 and Gpt2 = 0.461. A total of 13 individuals showed the phenotypic expression of 3 rare GPT alleles, Gpt3, Gpt6, and Gpt7. No heterogeneity in phenotype distribution was found, neither in the two sexes nor regionally in Norway. 97 foreigners involved in paternity cases in Norway showed a phenotype distribution not differing from that of Norwegians. In two small additional samples of Ethiopians and Easter Islanders, Gpt1 frequencies were 0.737 and 0.531, respectively. There were significant differences in phenotype distribution between NOrwegians and all African populations tested, some of the Asiatic population, Lapps and a few other populations.
ACE inhibitors which till recently were used only in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases are becoming a perspective group of drugs also in the treatment of chronic nephropathies. It was revealed that they are effective in particular in the treatment of proteinuria of different etiology and have also a marked renoprotective effect and are therefore recommended to slow down the progression of renal failure. They reduce intraglomerular hypertension, increase glomerular filtration and the renal blood flow, and it is assumed that they can retard the progression of chronic glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy. It may be excepted that their therapeutic application will in the near future be extended also to clinical nephrology.
PGM1 subtypes and ESD phenotypes of 600 mothers and their respective newborn infants residing in the northern part of the island of Tasmania were examined. The allele frequencies of PGM1 in the mothers were 1+ = 0.6525, 1- = 0.1250, 2+ = 0.1758 and 2- = 0.0467, and in the newborns were 1+ = 0.6675, 1- = 0.1275, 2+ = 0.01600 and 2- = 0.0450. Both samples were found to exhibit Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium conditions and there was no significant difference between them. Also, the frequencies of PGM1 alleles were overall similar to frequencies in neighbouring populations on the Australian mainland. The frequency of ESD*2 in both samples was similar (0.105) but the mothers' genotypes were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (due to an excess of type 2). The ESD allele frequencies in Tasmania are similar to those reported in other white Australian populations.
ACE inhibitors are used on a large scale basis in hypertensive diabetics, while the association between diabetes and hypertension is frequent and harmful. This is due to their excellent tolerance and efficacity. No specific advantage has been reported in their use regarding tolerance, i.e., they may not alter insulin sensitivity consistently. Conversely, ACE inhibitors may offer the specific advantage of protecting kidney function against diabetic microangiopathy, since their effects on glomerular haemodynamics seem independent from their hypotensive effect.
CP 55,940 [(-)-cis-3-[2-hydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-trans-4-(3- hydroxypropyl)cyclohexanol] is a potent bicyclic analog of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which has been used as a probe for a cannabinoid recognition site in neural tissue. In the present study, CP 55,490 was evaluated for delta 9-THC-like effects in rats and rhesus monkeys trained to discriminate delta 9-THC from vehicle. Rats trained to discriminate delta 9-THC (3.0 mg/kg i.p.) from vehicle were tested with various doses of delta 9-THC and CP 55,940 at both 30 and 90 min postinjection. Catalepsy was measured immediately after these operant tests using an adaptation of the mouse ring-test. In rats, CP 55,940 substituted for delta 9-THC at both 30 and 90 min postinjection at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg that had minimal effects on rates of responding. Doses of delta 9-THC (greater than 3.0 mg/kg) and CP 55,940 (greater than 0.1 mg/kg) that reduced response rates by greater than 50% also produced substantial increases in catalepsy. CP 55,940 and delta 9-THC had a similar time course for discriminative stimulus effects, but CP 55,940 was about 30 times more potent. In monkeys, the training dose of delta 9-THC ranged from 0.04 to 0.16 mg/kg i.m., adjusted individually to minimize response-rate disruption. After training, monkeys were tested with various doses of delta 9-THC and CP 55,940 at 30 min postinjection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
CAD is a multidomain protein that catalyzes the first three steps in mammalian de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. The 243-kDa polypeptide consists of four functional domains; glutamine amidotransferase (GLNase), carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPSase), aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase), and dihydroorotase (DHOase). Controlled proteolysis of hamster CAD was found to cleave the molecule into 18 fragments which successively accumulate and disappear during the course of digestion. Each fragment was isolated and partially sequenced to determine its location in the polypeptide chain. Proteolysis was found to usually occur at the junctions between the domains and sub-domains identified by sequence homology. All proteases of low to moderate specificity cleaved the molecule in a similar fashion. The rate of proteolysis widely varied and the interdomain regions were not always accessible to proteases. Each of the major functional domains is postulated to consist of subdomains. The duplicated halves of the CPSase domain (116 kDa) have a homologous structure consisting of 11-, 25-26-, and 21-22-kDa subdomains. Prolonged digestion cleaved the DHOase domain (36.6 kDa) into two stable species suggesting that this region is comprised of 11.5- and 15.0-kDa subdomains. Similarly, proteolysis of the 21-kDa catalytic subdomain of the GLNase domain (40 kDa) indicated a bilobal structure consisting of 12.3- and 8.5-kDa chain segments. The connecting region between the two ATCase subdomains (16.4 and 18 kDa) was not cleaved. Copurification of many of the domains showed that they remain associated by noncovalent interactions even after the connecting segments have been cleaved. The chain segments, the linkers, which connect the domains and subdomains were conserved in length but not in sequence, were predicted to be relatively hydrophilic and flexible but did not show a tendency to assume a particular secondary structure. These studies provide a more detailed map of the structural organization of the CAD polypeptide.
CD36 is an 88-kDa glycoprotein that has been identified on platelets, monocytes, and some endothelial cells. Experimental evidence suggests that CD36 mediates the binding of Plasmodium falciparum-infected RBC to a variety of cells, and therefore may play a role in the vascular complications associated with malaria. Additionally, CD36 may also bind the extracellular matrix proteins thrombospondin and collagen. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells have been used in in vitro models examining the binding of P. falciparum RBC to endothelial cells, but they do not consistently express cell surface CD36. Inasmuch as human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) differ in a variety of ways from large vessel endothelial cells, we have examined HDMEC for cell surface expression of CD36 in vivo and in vitro. Direct immunofluorescence of skin showed bright staining of HDMEC with antibody recognizing CD36 and flow cytometric analysis of cultured HDMEC revealed cell surface expression. In contrast, large vessel endothelial cells were not stained with antibody recognizing CD36 in vivo and cultured cells derived from umbilical vein failed to express cell surface CD36 in vitro. Western immunoblots of lysates of HDMEC but not human umbilical vein endothelial cells demonstrated an 88-kDa protein that comigrated with CD36 from platelets. Functional studies demonstrated that adherence of PRBC to HDMEC was inhibited up to 66% by mAb recognizing CD36. Furthermore, the expression of CD36 on HDMEC was increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner by IFN-gamma, and was decreased by protein kinase C agonists. These data demonstrate that HDMEC express functionally active CD36 and this expression can be positively and negatively regulated by soluble factors. This study demonstrates that HDMEC are useful in the study of CD36-mediated binding of PRBC to endothelial cells in vitro and provides further evidence of distinct phenotypic differences between HDMEC and large vessel endothelial cells.
ACE inhibitors elicit the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors in perfused isolated canine arteries (Mombouli and Vanhoutte, J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1991, 18: 926-927); this action is antagonized by bradykinin-receptor antagonists suggesting that it is mediated by local kinin generation. The effects of exogenous tissular kallikrein (porcine) were examined in vitro in the isolated canine coronary artery. Isometric tension was measured in blood vessel rings (with and without endothelium) contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha. The kallikrein elicited relaxations in rings with, but not in those without, endothelium. This response was augmented by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindoprilat, and it was antagonized by the selective B2-kinin receptor antagonist HOE 140 and aprotinin, an inhibitor of tissular kallikrein. These data suggest that in the canine coronary artery, kallikrein causes relaxations that may be mediated by kinins generated from endogenous kininogens present in the vascular wall.
CD36 (glycoprotein IV or IIIB) is an integral plasma membrane protein of wide cellular distribution and functions as a receptor site for thrombospondin (TSP), an adhesive protein important in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. OKM5, a monoclonal anti-CD36 antibody, has been reported to block CD36 cell adhesive functions suggesting that the OKM5 epitope on CD36 is functionally important. A panel of 10 synthetic CD36 peptides was made. One peptide, P139-155, specifically inhibited the immunoadsorption of CD36 by OKM5, and P139-155 was directly immunoadsorbed by OKM5, indicating that CD36 sequence 139-155 represents part of the OKM5 epitope. TSP bound to immobilized P139-155 in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. Surprisingly, P139-155 significantly augmented, instead of inhibited, binding of CD36 to TSP. This peptide did not induce platelet aggregation but augmented ADP- and collagen-induced aggregation in platelet-rich plasma. Another CD36 peptide, P93-110, which had no effect on OKM5 immunoadsorption, blocked binding of CD36 to immobilized TSP and partially inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation. P93-110 by itself did not bind to TSP; however, in the presence of P139-155, there was a marked enhancement of P93-110 binding to TSP, with a stoichiometry consistent with the trimeric nature of TSP. The data suggest that CD36-TSP interaction is a two-step process; the sequence 139-155 region of CD36 binds first to TSP, triggering a change in TSP to reveal a second site, which binds the 93-110 region of CD36 with high affinity. CD36 peptides can be used as stimulators or inhibitors in cellular adhesive events involving TSP-CD36 interaction. Conformational changes leading to the exposure or activation of high affinity binding sites may occur in both the receptor and the ligand upon cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion.
ABO blood group system's genotyping by polymerase chain reaction in genomic DNA level is developed. The positions of nucleotide 258 and 700 of cDNA from A transferase were used to distinguish A, B, and O alleles by restriction enzyme digestion. To identify the 258th nucleotide, a 199- or 200-bp DNA fragment was amplified by PCR and digested with Kpn I. For the 700th nucleotide, a 128-bp PCR amplified fragment was designed and digested with Alu I. By examining the DNA fragment digested patterns, ABO genotypes were easily determined. Results obtained using this method on 20 ABO-known peripheral blood samples showed that this new technique could provide accurate ABO genotype. Biologic forensic samples, such as, blood stains, saliva stains, semen stains, hair, bone tissue, and semen contaminated with vaginal secretion were also successfully typed. This rapid, sensitive and reliable method should be applicable not only in forensic identification but also in medical examination.
CAT was carried out in 110 patients with gastric carcinoma and its findings compared with the intraoperative findings. CAT involved a polypositional scanning (depending on the tumor site) against the background of oral contrast label of the stomach and intestine. CAT potentialities in the diagnosis of gastric carcinoma, assessment of the tumor size and involvement of the adjacent organs and structures, detection of the metastases were studied. Use of CAT in complex with other methods will help choose the optimal treatment strategy and determine the volume of supposed surgical intervention.
SDS PAGE protein patterns of 37 H2S-positive strains of species belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae including the genera Budvicia (11 strains) and Leminorella (L. grimontii--3 strains, L. richardii--4 strains) were compared with 10 strains of species Pragia fontium. All strains under study form well separated clusters with overall similarity C = .49. Clusters are separated in the range of C = .68-.83. They display high homogeneity, only one strain of Edwardsiella tarda clusters with budviciae. Strains of Pragia form two distinct clusters separated from other genera. Electrophoretograms of two strains which do not group as expected are analyzed and results discussed. Results support evidence that strains designated Pragia fontium deserve independent treatment as a new species.
CYP1A1 is considered to be involved mainly in oxidative metabolism of exogenous chemicals and drugs. Synthesis of this hemoprotein is induced in livers, lungs, and other tissues of experimental animals by the administration of these chemicals. Regulatory mechanisms of the induction process of the protein have been investigated by the DNA transfer method using the isolated genomic DNA. At least two kinds of cis-acting regulatory DNA sequences are localized 5' upstream of the gene. One is distributed five times in a relatively wide range from -0.5 to -3.5 kb and functions as an inducible enhancer-designated xenobiotic responsive element or XRE. The other is localized just upstream of the TATA sequence and acts as a regulatory element for the constitutive expression. The two DNA elements are required for a high level of the inducible expression. Their cognate DNA binding factors are recognized in the nuclear extracts of Hepa-1 cells and rat liver cells which show the inducible expression of CYP1A1 in response to the inducer. This paper discusses the regulatory mechanisms of CYP1A1 gene expression by summarizing the present state of knowledge about properties of the DNA regulatory elements and their cognate DNA-binding factors.
CAD reflects an alteration in the dynamic nature of coronary conduits. This alteration in function can be precipitated by a constellation of pathologic processes and combination of risk behaviors. Nursing intervention based on knowledge of pathophysiology of CAD and its interaction with risk factors and behaviors can play an important role in prevention of sequelae and development of effective therapeutic strategies.
SDS extracts of whole bacteria, representing five species and 15 serovars of Listeria, were analysed by SDS-PAGE and by immunoblotting with serum directed against whole formalin-treated L. monocytogenes. Profiles of L. monocytogenes were very different from those of other species of Listeria (i.e. L. innocua,L.welshimeri, L. seeligeri and L. ivanovii). This low degree of similarity between species was found even in the case of common serovars. Within the species L. monocytogenes, protein patterns were characterized, on the one hand, by a high degree of homogeneity between all strains of the same serovar and, on the other hand, by large differences between serovars, especially between sv. 1/2 and 4b. Thus we have identified major, surface-located protein antigens, specific for L. monocytogenes, either common to all serovars (64 and 68 kDa) or characteristic of certain serovars: 98 kDa for sv. 1/2 and 3; 76 and 78 kDa for sv. 4b, 4d and 4e; and 80 and 100 kDa for sv. 4a and 4c. Moreover, some of these bands (68 and 98 kDa) might be related to virulence, since differences were noticed between the profiles of haemolytic L. monocytogenes vs. 1/2a differing only in their virulence for immunocompromised mice. All these results confirmed, for the first time, the classification of Listeria obtained previously by genomic studies. They should help in the identification of new virulence factors and the development of easier and more specific methods of detection and identification.
CAT scan of the costovertebral joints has been performed in 17 patients with ankylosing spondylitis, all suffering from lower thoracic pain. Fourteen of them (82%) showed abnormal findings, including erosions and sclerosis, more pronounced in the vertebral side of the joint, and joint widening. Bony proliferation arising from the vertebral side in the anterior margin of the joint was also seen. One patient showed at the D12 level anterior bony bridges, similar to the vertebral syndesmophytes. Fusion was noted in five patients (including the three with longest disease duration) and represents the end result of the inflammatory process. These changes provide an anatomical basis for the understanding of the thoracic pain in AS patients.
ACE inhibitors have been available by prescription since the marketing of captopril in the early 1980s. Since that time, six additional ACE inhibitors have been marketed, four of which received approval from the Food and Drug Association in 1991. All but one of the new ACE inhibitors are carboxylic-acid compounds, and all of them maintain a pro-drug metabolic pathway. Initially, ACE inhibitors were approved only for the control of high blood pressure. More recently, captopril and enalapril have been approved for use in congestive heart failure. In 1988, ACE inhibitors were one of the recommended first-line therapies for mild-to-moderate hypertension. Their use in patients with hypertension has steadily increased, most likely because of their minimal effect on coexistent cardiovascular risk factors. In CHF, ACE inhibitors are the only single drug class that has been shown to reduce mortality and hospitalizations due to the disease without concomitant administration of another drug. ACE inhibitors are clearly drugs that should be used early in the treatment of most patients with CHF. Differences between ACE inhibitors are often difficult to define. As information regarding the clinical utility of tissue ACE inhibition is unveiled, the ability to use a selected ACE inhibitor based on individual patient characteristics may increase. The future for ACE inhibition looks promising and the cumulative clinical value of ACE inhibition appears to be just beginning.
ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) have now been shown to improve symptoms and survival in patients with mild, moderate and severe chronic heart failure. Their mechanism of action is thought to be a combination of RAAS suppression and augmentation of bradykinin and prostaglandins. Although ACE inhibitors improve hemodynamics post myocardial infarction, we do not yet have consistent data on their effects on symptoms or survival in these particular patients. One other potential benefit is their effects on reperfusion injury and free radicals. As yet only minor differences have been found to exist between different ACEIs but increasing attention is now being focussed in this direction.
CAD is a 243-kDa multidomain polypeptide which catalyzes the first three steps in mammalian de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. The largest cDNA clone obtained thus far, pCAD142 (Shigesada, K., Stark, G.R., Maley, J. A., Niswander, L. A., and Davidson, J. N. (1985) Mol. Cell. Biol. 5, 1735), lacks the 5' end of the mRNA which encodes the amino terminus of CAD. To clone this missing segment, a synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to pCAD142 and poly(A)+ RNA template, isolated from a Syrian hamster cell line which overproduces the CAD mRNA, were used for cDNA synthesis. The resulting clone pKB11, which has a 1369-base pair (bp) cDNA insert, overlapping pCAD142 by 781 bp, was identified by hybridization methods and sequence analysis and found to contain the entire cDNA sequence for the amino end of the CAD polypeptide. The deduced amino acid sequence is homologous to seven carbamyl phosphate synthetases. Primer extension, oligonucleotide-directed RNase H digestion, and RNA sequencing indicated that pKB11 extends to within 68 bases of the 5' end of the CAD mRNA. This conclusion was confirmed by Northern blotting analysis of the 5'-flanking region of CAD gene. The probable 3' end of an unidentified gene which codes for a 1-kilobase (kb) transcript was identified immediately upstream of the CAD gene. Northern analysis using probes complementary to the region between the CAD and the 1-kb genes detected the presence of a small transcript of less than 300 nucleotides. The sequence revealed three potential translation initiation sites raising the possibility of more than one CAD translation product. The major translation start codon was identified as the first ATG in pKB11 by sequence homology, in vitro transcription and translation, and protein studies. Starting from this ATG within pKB11, the clone encodes a 143-residue domain of unknown function. This study completes the determination of the primary structure of the CAD polypeptide. The CAD mRNA is 7.5 kb in length and has 6675 bp of coding sequence and about 200 bp and 600 bp of untranslated sequence at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively.
CAD is the multifunctional protein of higher eukaryotes which catalyzes the first three steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis. Its enzymatic activities exist as independent domains in the order: N terminus-carbamylphosphate synthetase II(CPSase)-dihydroorotase(DHOase)-aspartate transcarbamylase(ATCase)-C terminus. To functionally define the minimum hamster cDNA region required to encode an active DHOase, expression constructs were generated. Many such constructs complement Escherichia coli mutants defective not only in DHOase but also in ATCase. Constructs deleted for most of the sequence encoding the ATCase domain continue to complement E. coli mutants defective in DHOase. All of these smaller constructs also lack the region encoding CPSase. Therefore, a 'genetic cassette', containing information for neither the CPSase nor the ATCase domain, can direct the synthesis of a polypeptide with DHOase activity. Interestingly, inclusion of a portion of the DHOase-ATCase interdomain bridge appears to be required for optimum activity.
CD36 recognizes a 88 Kd glycoprotein, found on different cell populations involved in immunoregulation and are induced on keratinocytes by in vitro treatment with gamma-interferon. Therefore, we obtained skin biopsies from 48 patients with various dermatological diseases and from 5 healthy volunteers and stained these with monoclonal antibodies OKM5 (CD36), anti-HLA-DR and OKT6 (CD1a) using a three stage immunoperoxidase method. In normal skin, CD36 expression was not observed. In contrast, keratinocytes in diseased skin were CD36+. In most cases, the staining was restricted to the stratum granulosum and the stratum spinosum, but in psoriasis, squamous cell carcinoma and lymphomatoid papulosis, more extensive staining of keratinocytes was seen. In addition, CD36+ epidermal leukocytes were found in allergic patch-test infiltrates and in mycosis fungoides. The findings of CD36 expression by epidermal cells within a broad spectrum of dermatological diseases indicate a role for these cells in the regulation of immune reactions in the skin.
G6PD activity in erythrocytes was examined in 129 people with malignant neoplasms (83 males, 46 females). In all these subjects G6PD activity in erythrocytes was markedly higher than in the controls. Tumour surgery resulted in decreased activity of that enzyme in the erythrocytes. The controls were 53 healthy persons (38 males, 15 females) not exposed occupationally to carcinogens.
CYP2E1 is solely responsible for microsomal P450-mediated ethanol oxidation activity. This enzyme is also involved in a pathway leading to gluconeogenesis from ketone bodies and in metabolic activation of numerous foreign compounds to intermediates that can be toxic to cells. Metabolic activation of certain procarcinogens by CYP2E1 may also lead to cell transformation. Regulation of CYP2E1 is especially intriguing. The CYP2E1 gene is transcriptionally activated in rat liver from a dormant state within a few hours after birth. This activation is due in part to the participation of a transcription factor designated hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 or HNF-1. In adult animals, constitutive expression of the enzyme is controlled to some degree by growth hormone. CYP2E1 is also regulated by many of its substrates through a substrate-induced stabilization of the enzyme. Under extreme conditions of fasting and uncontrolled diabetes CYP2E1 mRNA is stabilized.
CAD has been used in over 20,000 patients in an Accident and Emergency Department. Structured documentation has replaced normal case notes and a patient record is created which includes investigations and management. A copy of the documentation acts as an immediate communication to the general practitioner. The information is held on a computer and is readily accessed to produce feedback and to allow audit of any number of parameters. The results show that an improvement in diagnostic accuracy and a reduction in admissions and unnecessary laparotomies continues over 15 years. Problems have occurred; some are inherent to the system and some have been minimized as a result of a series of studies. The savings in terms of finance and facilities are considerable and the cost is small in comparison as the programs are available and the cost of hardware has diminished. It is concluded that documentation is essential. This allows the more accurate collection of information, permits analysis, acts as a method of communication and creates a detailed patient record. The use of this part of the CADA system produces a considerable improvement in the parameters used to assess satisfactory patient management. The computer diagnostic program produces a higher level of diagnostic accuracy than that obtained by doctors who are not using the system. It does not normally exceed the accuracy of the doctors who are using the structured documentation and entering the information into the computer. Other mathematical models might lead to an improvement, particularly if they were based on the diagnostic process used by a senior clinician. The method of entry of information could be facilitated by modern technology, including light pens or word sensitive computers. This would reduce the time required for completion of the documents. A number of possible improvements in the CADA system are reported and some have been studied in detail with little evidence of significant change. The computer part of the system has an educational value and presents a stimulating challenge to the junior hospital staff seeing the patient for the first time in the Accident and Emergency Department. Rapid feedback is possible and advantageous. Possibly the greatest value of the computer is in the analysis of the value of clinical features in diagnosis, which has not been easy in the past. It has also allowed precise assessment of the value of investigations in the diagnosis of patients with a suspected disease, which leads to more appropriate management and the saving of facilities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
PGD (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) gene frequencies were reported in wild pigs, Sus scrofa, of three subspecies, i.e. Japanese wild pig, S.s. leucomystax, Ryukyu wild pig, S.s. riukiuanus, and Formosan wild pig, S.s. taivanus. Five phenotypes (A, AB, B, AC' and C') were observed. The C' variant was found only in the S.s. leucomystax, and may be identical to PGD-C reported by Archibald & McTeir (1988). PGD-A was a common variant in all the species in the genus Sus including wild pig, Sus scrofa, Javan pig, Sus verrucosus, and Bearded pig, Sus barbatus, and predominated in the whole populations examined except some of those of the S.s. riukiuanus. This suggested that the PGDA appeared before the other two alleles (B and C') during the evolution of the genus Sus.
"GK 13 (N-[1-(2-benzo (b) thiophenyl)-cyclohexyl] piperidine), GBR 12783 (1-[2-(diphenylmethoxy)-ethyl] 4-(3-phenyl propenyl)-piperazine and dexamphetamine are three indirect catecholaminergic agonists, acting via different neurochemical mechanisms. We have compared their effects in rodents, in several behavioral tests. All three drugs increased locomotion. The stimulant locomotor effect of dexamphetamine was more easily antagonized by haloperidol than that of GBR 12783 and GK 13. Only dexamphetamine reversed reserpine-induced akinesia. This reversal was prevented by pretreatment with either GK 13 or GBR 12783. The three drugs reduced pentobarbital sleeping time in mice. They induced rotation ipsilateral to a unilateral 6-OHDA lesion of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. The stereotypies induced by GK 13 and GBR 12783 were essentially limited to sniffing. Haloperidol-induced catalepsy was apparently more easily antagonized by dexamphetamine than by GK 13 or GBR 12783. GK 13 and GBR 12783 had no significant effects on body temperature. The three drugs displayed an anti-immobility effect in the ""despair test"". Dexamphetamine and GK 13 reversed the hypothermia induced by apomorphine (16 mg/kg), as well as reserpine-induced hypothermia and reserpine-induced ptosis. Dexamphetamine induced a dose-dependent anorectic effect, whereas GK 13 and GBR 12783 induced only a brief and partial anorexia. Similar observations were made on water intake. Pretreatment with either GBR 12783 or GK 13 did not affect the dexamphetamine-induced anorexia. Effects of the three drugs are discussed by reference to their known neurochemical properties on catecholaminergic transmission."
ACE inhibition may be useful in several manifestations of ischaemic heart disease, such as heart failure due to ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Recent evidence suggests that these effects may also be present in normotensive patients with ischaemic heart disease without heart failure. Theoretically, converting-enzyme inhibition, through coronary and systemic vasodilating effects and negative inotropic properties, should have a favourable effect on the myocardial oxygen supply/demand ratio and, hence, affect the incidence and severity of myocardial ischaemia. It is doubtful, however, whether these cardiac and extracardiac properties of ACE inhibitors really underlie its potential antiischaemic effects, at least in the average patient with ischaemic heart disease without concomitant heart failure and hypertension. Recent animal and human studies indicate that converting-enzyme inhibitors may modulate myocardial ischaemia by reducing ischaemia-induced circulating neurohumoral activation. It has been shown that, depending on the severity of ischaemia, the circulating renin-angiotensin system may become activated together with an increase in circulating catecholamine levels. ACE inhibition suppresses this neuroendocrine stimulation during ischaemia and modulates subsequent systemic and, presumably, also coronary vasoconstriction. In addition to these effects on circulating neurohormones, ACE inhibition could affect myocardial ischaemia through a number of local actions, e.g. modulation of tissue (cardiac) angiotensin II formation and bradykinin breakdown, stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis and, in the use of sulphydryl compounds, by affecting EDRF formation. Whether ACE inhibitors have clear antiischaemic effects in all clinical conditions is uncertain. Their efficacy to limit exercise-induced ischaemia has been questioned. In contrast, pacing-induced ischaemia in patients at rest is clearly prevented by ACE inhibition. This differential effect may be related to a more pronounced difference in circulating neurohormones during exercise per se. It also suggests that ACE inhibitors may be particularly useful as (additional) antiischaemic therapy in patients with angina at rest, e.g. unstable angina and the acute phase of myocardial infarction.
CAD in young male adults below the age of 40 years has generally been found to be associated with the usual risk factors associated with CAD. In a lesser number of young adults, MIs may be related to cocaine use. Sympathomimetic effects and increase in myocardial oxygen demand are factors considered responsible for acute MI in cocaine-abusing patients. In young adults who are asymptomatic following an acute MI and who are able to pass treadmill exercise stress tests at levels of Bruce stage 4 have been shown to have normal coronary arteriograms. Thus this subset should not require routine coronary angiograms following an acute MI.
AGA is an angiitis syndrome that has some characteristic features, for example preceding asthma and polyneuritis. And histological findings are granulomatous angiitis or extravascular granuloma. We report two typical cases of AGA. Case 1; 51-year-old woman had been suffering from asthmatic dyspnea for one year and developed in 1987 multiple neuritis in her extremities. Eosinophilia and high level of IgE were noted. Pathologic diagnosis of the biopsied right calf muscle specimen was granulomatous angiitis. Case 2; 40-year-old woman had been suffering from asthmatic dyspnea for two years. She complained of severe cough and myalgia in 1986 and her chest X-ray showed homogeneous shadows in right upper and left lower fields. And her blood showed eosinophilia and high level of IgE. The histology of the biopsied subcutaneous nodules of hands showed extravascular granuloma. These two cases had specific features of AGA. About symptoms of angiitis, case 1 showed multiple neuritis and case 2 had subcutaneous nodules of hands. About laboratory data, case 1 showed WBC count of 9400/mm3 with 85% eosinophils and high level of IgE at 1400 IU/ml, case 2 had WBC count of 13200/mm3 with 22% eosinophils and IgE at 846 IU/ml. The vary of eosinophil count and IgE level were related to the degree and course of illness. These symptoms and laboratory data, except neuritis, improved by an administration of prednisolone. In early stage of AGA, prednisolone is effective, so the criteria of AGA and usage of corticosteroids must be considered.
PAH analyses in vegetables are often difficult to carry out; therefore two different clean-up methods, which allow elimination of interfering matrix components such as essential oils, waxes, carotinoids and chlorophylls were developed. Clean-up of 32 different vegetables samples consisted of either Bio-Beads S-X3 chromatography or semi-preparative HPLC on silica gel Si-60. PAH were determined by capillary GC-MS, which allowed the application of deuterium-labeled internal standards. The results are presented; higher PAH contamination was detected in kale and parsley.
AGA and AGG codons for arginine are the least used codons in Escherichia coli, which are encoded by a rare tRNA, the product of the dnaY gene. We examined the positions of arginine residues encoded by AGA/AGG codons in 678 E. coli proteins. It was found that AGA/AGG codons appear much more frequently within the first 25 codons. This tendency becomes more significant in those proteins containing only one AGA or AGG codon. Other minor codons such as CUA, UCA, AGU, ACA, GGA, CCC and AUA are also found to be preferentially used within the first 25 codons. The effects of the AGG codon on gene expression were examined by inserting one to five AGG codons after the 10th codon from the initiation codon of the lacZ gene. The production of beta-galactosidase decreased as more AGG codons were inserted. With five AGG codons, the production of beta-galactosidase (Gal-AGG5) completely ceased after a mid-log phase of cell growth. After 22 hr induction of the lacZ gene, the overall production of Gal-AGG5 was 11% of the control production (no insertion of arginine codons). When five CGU codons, the major arginine codon were inserted instead of AGG, the production of beta-galactosidase (Gal-CGU5) continued even after stationary phase and the overall production was 66% of the control. The negative effect of the AGG codons on the Gal-AGG5 production was found to be dependent upon the distance between the site of the AGG codons and the initiation codon. As the distance was increased by inserting extra sequences between the two codons, the production of Gal-AGG5 increased almost linearly up to 8 fold. From these results, we propose that the position of the minor codons in an mRNA plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression possibly by modulating the stability of the initiation complex for protein synthesis.
CA1 neurones of the adult rat hippocampal slice preparation were voltage clamped at or near -40 mV membrane potential using a single electrode clamp method. Depolarizing voltage commands from a holding potential of -40 mV elicited voltage-dependent inward Ca2+ currents comprising a fast and a slow component. The latter one was investigated for its susceptibility to inactivation, which was maximally expressed at around 0 mV membrane potential. When extracellular Ca2+ was replaced by Ba2+, inward currents became much larger and were followed by long tail currents. Similar data were observed in neurones injected with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. It is suggested that inactivation of the slow Ca2+ current depends at least partly on the levels of intracellular free Ca2+ in hippocampal neurones.
ABO and Rh blood groups in 344 filarial patients and 320 controls matched with respect to age, community and residence are reported. An excess of B and a deficiency of AB was observed among the filarial patients. The relative risks for the B and AB were 1.53 and 0.36, respectively. Only males showed clearly significant risks. The Rh(D) blood groups revealed no association with filariasis.
CYP2E1 is a cytochrome P-450 that is well conserved in many species and carries out oxidation of both endogenous and numerous foreign chemicals. This enzyme is the primary component of the methylglyoxal and propandiol pathways of gluconeogenesis. It is also the principal P-450 involved in metabolism of many small molecular weight chemicals that are found in solvents and in the environment. Among important drugs metabolized by CYP2E1 are anesthetic agents such as halothane, the analgesic acetaminophen, and the muscle relaxant chlorzoxazone. Most importantly CYP2E1 is capable of converting certain procarcinogenic nitrosamines to their active DNA-binding metabolites. The CYP2E1 gene becomes transcriptionally active in the liver soon after birth. Although the physiological stimulus for this increase is still unknown, the molecular basis of CYP2E1 gene activation is becoming clear. Transcription of the CYP2E1 gene is primarily due to the binding of the hepatocyte-specific transcription factor HNF-1 to a segment of DNA just upstream of the start site for RNA synthesis. In adult animals, CYP2E1 is posttranscriptionally regulated through mRNA and protein stabilization. Stabilization of CYP2E1 protein is due to interaction of the enzyme with its own substrate.
CS most probably manifests its immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting the synthesis of IL-2 and other lymphokine mRNAs during the process of T-cell activation. The detailed molecular events involved in CS's inhibition of mRNA synthesis are not known, but it is likely that the drug prevents transduction of the mitogenic signal from the cell surface to the nucleus at a point subsequent to the rise in intracellular calcium generated by the mitogenic signal. CS immunosuppression also appears to be related to the binding of an intracellular receptor protein, cyclophilin, which is a major cytosolic constituent of all cells and has peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity. The involvement of this protein in T-cell activation, if any, is not yet known. Studies on the biochemical basis of CS-induced nephrotoxicity are still in their infancy and the relation of toxicity to immunosuppression is not understood. It is evident that the mode of action of CS provides an intriguing puzzle and a challenge in both its immunosuppressive and nephrotoxic aspects. The elucidation of the biochemistry of CS will surely not only improve the use of this important drug but will also increase our understanding of T-lymphocyte activation and the mechanism underlying the control of gene expression.
ACE inhibition is widely used for treatment of arterial hypertension or congestive heart failure. No change occurs in glucose metabolism either in diabetic or non diabetic subjects. No change occurs in glucose metabolism in patients with chronic renal failure. Glucose intolerance induced by diuretics is attenuated when ACE inhibitor is associated with thiazides. In some very rare circumstances (with high plasmatic levels of norepinephrine), insulin sensitivity seems to be enhanced by captopril. Then, in clinical use, no adverse effect occurs with ACE inhibition in non diabetic or diabetic subjects. Under thiazide treatment, ACE inhibitors protect against glucose intolerance.
CAD results from atherosclerosis, a chronic disease process that has its origin in childhood. Children and adolescents can be at higher risk for CAD by virtue of being from families with premature CAD or familial dyslipoproteinemias. The plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels result from a number of complex metabolic processes that are under the control of genetic and environmental (e.g., diet) influences. The normal ranges of plasma lipids and lipoproteins in children are known, and children and adolescents with dyslipoproteinemia are ordinarily defined as those having levels of plasma total, LDL, or triglyceride above the 95th percentile or with a low HDL cholesterol below the 5th percentile. Children of a parent with documented dyslipoproteinemia or with family history of premature CAD may be screened in the fasting state any time after 2 years of age. Following the exclusion of secondary causes of dyslipoproteinemia, the diagnosis of primary dyslipoproteinemia can be made. Lipoprotein patterns are not diagnostic for a given genotype. Efforts to determine further the biochemical defects responsible for a given phenotype have led to the investigation of gene coding for the apolipoproteins, the key enzymes in the lipoproteins pathways (LPL, HDL, and LCAT) and the receptors that process lipoproteins, such as the LDL receptor and the chylomicron remnant receptor. From a practical standpoint, the diagnosis of the kind of dyslipoproteinemia in a child will depend upon the nature and severity of the dyslipoproteinemia, both in the child (or adolescent) and in parents and siblings. Marked increases in plasma total and LDL cholesterol in the child and in at least one of the parents often reflect the presence of familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited dominant condition due to a defect in the LDL receptor gene. The triglyceride levels are often normal. If the child has a different dyslipoproteinemia pattern from siblings and parents, then the diagnosis of familial combined hyperlipidemia or hyperapobetalipoproteinemia should be considered. Most children with mild or borderline elevations in total and LDL cholesterol will have polygenic hypercholesterolemia. Triglyceride problems in children and adolescents are relatively uncommon, particularly the more severe hypertriglyceridemia such as that found in lipoprotein lipase and apoC-II deficiency, dysbetalipoproteinemia, and type V hyperlipoproteinemia. High levels of Lp(a) lipoprotein, in isolation or in combination with other dyslipoproteinemia, accelerate risk for CAD. Low levels of HDL cholesterol in the absence of other abnormalities suggest the diagnosis of hypoalphalipoproteinemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
ACE inhibitors have antihypertensive efficacy similar to that of thiazides, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists. They are simple to prescribe and to take, and are relatively free from subjective side-effects apart from persistent dry cough. There are few specific concerns about safety, but experience of long-term use is still relatively limited. They are valuable additional or alternative antihypertensive drugs when standard therapy is contraindicated or fails to control blood pressure.
ACE inhibition has provided many insights into the etiology and treatment of renovascular hypertension. Not only have studies using these agents profoundly expanded our understanding of the mechanisms governing preservation of renal perfusion pressures and function beyond arterial lesions, they have provided tools for more precise diagnosis and therapy in clinical practice. ACE inhibitors must be considered the agents of choice for the treatment of renovascular hypertension and provide an effective and safe medical alternative for many patients developing atherosclerotic renovascular lesions with an otherwise unacceptable risk for revascularization procedures. With the advent of widespread clinical use of these agents, however, come many new questions regarding the long-term fate of the kidney beyond vascular lesions and the need for preservation of renal function.
ACE inhibitors have provided a major advance in cardiovascular therapeutics. The rationale for their use in hypertension and heart failure, and their cardiac effects are well documented. Further information is required on the relevance of their direct myocardial and other tissue effects, and it is likely that their use in hypertension and heart failure will increase further over the next several years.
ME1 is a monoclonal antibody reactive in frozen tissue sections with normal mesothelial cells and malignant mesotheliomas. In this immunoperoxidase study, ME1 reacted with all 40 epithelial type malignant mesotheliomas. Fifty percent or more of the mesothelioma cells were stained in all cases and the staining intensity was strong in 32 and moderate in eight. In contrast, all 19 well- and moderately differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinomas were completely negative, and of the total 88 non-mesotheliomatous malignancies studied, staining comparable to the mesotheliomas was seen in only 6 tumors (2 pulmonary adenocarcinomas, 2 adenocarcinomas of the breast, 1 adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, and 1 melanoma), although limited, weaker staining was seen in additional cases. Five of the six strongly to moderately positive nonmesotheliomatous tumors had immunoreactivity for complementary immunoreactants (CEA, Leu-M1, S-100 protein, HMB-45). Our results with ME1, the first monoclonal antibody that recognizes malignant mesothelial cells, provides a basis for using this reagent in the differential diagnosis of tumors of the pleura and peritoneum.
ADA was examined in pleural fluid in cases of tuberculous and cancerous pleurisy. The level of ADA in pleural fluid in tuberculosis group (59.6 +/- 33.6 U/L) was significantly higher than that of cancerous group (13.3 +/- 4.0 U/L) (P less than 0.01). The positive rates were 90.0% and 3.3% respectively.
PAH metabolism is known to proceed in two successive steps, the first step resulting in the production of activated metabolites which are subsequently transformed by the different pathways involved in the second step. Microspectrofluorometry enables the study of the kinetics of these steps in living intact cells into which no imbalance has been artificially introduced. We used this technique to check the influence of pre-incubation with D-galactosamine on the kinetics of the detoxification step. 9- and 3-hydroxybenzo(a)pyrene (OH-B(a)P) were selected as fluorescent substrates because they are potential substrates for the different pathways of the second step. The physiological cell status was controlled at the level of the intrinsic cellular fluorescence. Pre-incubation with D-galactosamine results in a strong decrease of the experimental rate constants characteristic of the metabolism of 9- and 3-OH-B(a)P in both RTG2 and 3T3 cells. Moreover, such pre-incubation leads to a strong decrease of the transitory intracellular accumulation of 3-O-glucuronide when 3-OH-B(a)P is used as substrate for 3T3 cells. Nevertheless, it cannot be said that both phenols cannot be used as substrates by MFOs and STase, at least in rigorous experimental conditions.
ABO blood group antigens on the membrane of human spermatozoa were investigated with the peroxidase-labelled antibody test. Spermatozoa from O secretor were incubated with saliva or seminal plasma of A and B secretors, but the specific peroxidase staining was negative. This result indicates that blood group antigens on human spermatozoa originate from spermatozoon itself, but not from seminal plasma.
MPO activity in the neutrophils has been evaluated in 25 patients with lung carcinoma. Surprisingly for us we observed no differences between patients and controls in the total MPO activity. However, we noted the increase in the percentage granulocytes with the first and fourth degree of scores in cancer patients in comparison to normal adults. The highest activity was characterized by the distribution of this enzyme not only in granules but also outside them. Any changes in the total activity of MPO may reflect the balance between the factors which may stimulate it as tumor promoters enhancing the production of superoxide anion or the inhibitory effect of plasma. Diffuse enzymatic reaction may be due to some functional abnormalities of phagocytosis or membrane damage by the MPO system. The role of MPO in anticancer mechanisms is briefly discussed.
CDA 1 is a novel antigen that within the brain is present specifically in neuronal growth cones. Electron microscope immunohistochemistry and subcellular fractionation showed the CDA 1 epitope to be on a cytosolic molecule. In cultured neurons, it is abundant in growth cones and not detectable in neurites or cell bodies. The development of the rat cerebral cortex was investigated by using the monoclonal antibody to CDA 1 and an antibody to SVP38, the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein. CDA 1 immunoreactivity in the rat cerebral cortex peaks just before birth and disappears by postnatal day 12, a few days before the major increase in the number of mature synapses. In contrast, SVP38 is expressed in parallel with the appearance of mature synapses. CDA 1 and SVP38 thus are markers of growth cones and synapses, respectively. Their expression during development reflects some of the structural and functional changes that occur during synapse formation.
AGA and AGG (AGR) are arginine codons in the universal genetic code. These codons are read as serine or are used as stop codons in metazoan mitochondria. The arginine residues coded by AGR in yeast or Trypanosoma are coded by arginine CGN throughout metazoan mitochondria. AGR serine sites in metazoan mitochondria are occupied mainly in corresponding sites in yeast or Trypanosoma mitochondria by UCN serine, AGY serine, or codons for amino acids other than serine or arginine. Based on these observations, we propose the following evolutionary events. AGR codons became unassigned because of deletion of tRNA Arg (UCU) and elimination of AGR codons by conversion to CGN arginine codons. Upon acquisition by serine tRNA of pairing ability with AGR codons, some codons for amino acids other than arginine mutated to AGR, and were captured by anticodon GCU in serine tRNA. During vertebrate mitochondrial evolution, AGR stop codons presumably were created from UAG stop by deletion of the first nucleotide U and by use of R as the third nucleotide that had existed next to the ancestral UAG stop.
GPT is currently used as a surrogate test for detection of the non-A, non-B carrier state. Among the patients who received the blood at least one blood unit from donor with relatively high level of GPT (26-35 KU), incidence of post-transfusion NANB hepatitis was higher than that of the patients who received only blood with low level of GPT (less than or equal to 25 KU). It is expected that introduction of lower GPT cut-off value will substantially reduce the incidence of post-transfusion NANB hepatitis. We reviewed several factors, such as gender, age and body weight that could potentially affect GPT activity, using the data of 40,967 regular blood donors for GPT who donated at Fukuoka Red Cross Blood Center from October to November, 1987. The upper limit of normal GPT for males is significantly higher than that of females. GPT values in both males and females progressively increase with the age and body weight. It would therefore seem that gender, age and body weight should be taken into account in resetting of GPT cut-off values to prevent post-transfusion NANB hepatitis.
ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme; peptidyl dipeptidase A; EC 3.4.15.1), cleaves C-terminal dipeptides from active peptides containing a free C-terminus. We investigated the hydrolysis of cholecystokinin-8 [CCK-8; Asp-Tyr(SO3H)-Met-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2] and of various gastrin analogues by purified rabbit lung ACE. Although these peptides are amidated at their C-terminal end, they were metabolized by ACE to several peptide fragments. These fragments were analysed by h.p.l.c., isolated and identified by comparison with synthetic fragments, and by amino acid analysis. The initial and major site of hydrolysis was the penultimate peptide bond, which generated a major product, the C-terminal amidated dipeptide Asp-Phe-NH2. As a secondary cleavage, ACE subsequently released di- or tri-peptides from the C-terminal end of the remaining N-terminal fragments. The cleavage of CCK-8 and gastrin analogues was inhibited by ACE inhibitors (Captopril and EDTA), but not by other enzyme inhibitors (phosphoramidon, thiorphan, bestatin etc.). Hydrolysis of [Leu15]gastrin-(14-17)-peptide [Boc (t-butoxycarbonyl)-Trp-Leu-Asp-Phe-NH2] in the presence of ACE was found to be dependent on the chloride-ion concentration. Km values for the hydrolysis of CCK-8, [Leu15]gastrin-(11-17)-peptide and Boc-[Leu15]gastrin-(14-17)-peptide at an NaCl concentration of 300 mM were respectively 115, 420 and 3280 microM, and the catalytic constants were about 33, 115 and 885 min-1. The kcat/Km for the reactions at 37 degrees C was approx. 0.28 microM-1.min-1, which is approx. 35 times less than that reported for the cleavage of angiotensin I. These results suggest that ACE might be involved in the metabolism in vivo of CCK and gastrin short fragments.
SMS 201-995 (Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ) is a synthetic peptide analog of native somatostatin that has been used to relieve symptoms caused by neuroendocrine tumors. Reports have described an insulin suppressive effect of SMS 201-995 that results in elevations of blood glucose. We report a patient with a metastatic small bowel carcinoid and renal failure in whom mild symptomatic hypoglycemia occurred 30 to 60 minutes after SMS 201-995 administration. No increase in insulin or decreases in glucagon, cortisol, or catecholamines were observed during these hypoglycemic episodes. Elevated levels of growth hormone fell gradually following SMS 201-995 administration and did not temporally correspond to the 30- to 60-minute nadir of blood glucose. However, SMS 201-995 levels peaked during this 30- to 60-minute period. As clinical experience with this drug broadens, patients whose glucose control is dependent on counter-regulatory hormones should be monitored for the possibility of hypoglycemia.
LCAT activity and mass were assayed simultaneously in 23 members of a new family case, revealing two homozygotes with a markedly low HDL--cholesterol level and ester cholesterol ratio. The LCAT mass in these patients was only 0.8 and 0.9 micrograms/ml, respectively (normal range 4.4-8.1) and their LCAT activity was 4 and 6 nM/ml/h 37 degrees C (normal range 60-120). Apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I and II levels were significantly low; however, apolipoprotein E tended to be high. In two-dimensional electrophoresis, apo A-I isoform visualized the increase of immature apo A-I; that is, A-I2. One subject showed the clinical characteristics of classic LCAT deficiency; however, the other, who was a vegetarian, showed corneal opacities and red cell deformity, but not proteinuria. This suggests that a low fat diet which decreases the level of atherogenic large LDL, may lead to a more favourable prognosis with a reduced risk for renal insufficiency. There were two different types of LCAT abnormality in this family series. Among the 10 examined paternal kindred of the proband who was one of two homozygotes, seven had a low LCAT mass but normal LCAT activity with the exception of one kindred who had a low mass and low activity. In contrast, among his seven maternal kindred examined, two had a low LCAT activity but normal mass.
RPE cell migration and proliferation are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of PVR. Since PVR develops in situations where vitreous contacts the RPE, we sought to determine whether human vitreous contains factors that stimulate proliferation and migration of RPE cells. We found that postmortem human vitreous stimulates migration but not proliferation of human RPE cells in vitro under serum-free conditions. A significant vitreous growth factor activity for RPE cells and fibroblasts, however, could be released by admixture of albumin with the vitreous. These findings suggest that vitreous contributes modulators that stimulate some functions of RPE cells that are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of PVR (fig. 22). Since macrophages are a ubiquitous component of periretinal membranes, we sought to determine whether they modulate proliferation and/or migration of RPE cells, functions that may be essential for the development of PVR. Using an in vitro assay, we found that macrophage supernatant contains factors that stimulate proliferation and migration of cultured human RPE cells. Since IL-1 is a product of activated macrophages that modulates a number of cellular functions, we also examined its effect on RPE proliferation and migration. We found that IL-1 increased migration but did not affect proliferation, and thus could not duplicate the effect of macrophage supernatant. Injection of activated macrophages into the vitreous of rabbits which had a retinal hole stimulated RPE cell proliferation in the area of the retinal hole, where the RPE cells were exposed. These findings suggest the ability of macrophages to modulate functions of RPE cells that are thought to be critical for the development of PVR (fig. 22). We initiated studies to define modulation of cultured RPE cell morphology by exposure to vitreous or to macrophage-conditioned media. Vitreous, serum, and albumin alone had no effect on the epithelial appearance of RPE cells in vitro. However, macrophage-conditioned media and vitreous-serum or vitreous-albumin mixtures induced a reversible fibroblast-like appearance in these cells. These findings show that macrophages produce a morphoplastic substance for RPE cells, and suggest that vitreous also contains a factor(s) that affects RPE cell shape, and that requires mediation by serum components (fig. 22).
"CP is not a disease but rather a descriptive term that identifies a heterogeneous group of children who manifest primarily chronic motor impairment. It should be appreciated that the large group of children identified under this heading have a broad range of associated handicaps. It is also important to recognize that there is an extremely wide range of variability in terms of the degree of impairment each child may exhibit. Therefore, appropriate management strategies and family counseling must be individualized. The importance of communicating with families cannot be overstressed. The management of children will require expertise in many fields. A multidisciplinary approach is therefore preferable for the comprehensive management of children with CP. If a specialized multidisciplinary clinic setting is not available, an ""integrated effort coordinator,"" the primary physician, is essential to optimize care of the child with CP."
CAD is a complex disease with multiple etiologies and aggravating events. Yet, elevated plasma cholesterol levels, chiefly in the form of LDL, are essential for the progression of the atherosclerotic lesion. Any total plasma cholesterol level above an ideal of 180 mg/dl (and an LDL cholesterol level of 100 mg/dl) must be considered atherogenic in the presence of other risk factors. In patients at high risk for death from CAD, combined diet and drug therapy should have as a goal the attainment of ideal lipoprotein values. Drug therapies are now available that make it possible to substantially lower elevated LDL levels in almost all patients and even to achieve ideal levels in those at highest risk.
ABO groups were investigated on skin (and muscle), bone and hair specimens from 14 Egyptian mummies dating from the Roman period. Samples were tested by the AE (absorption-elution), MA (mixed agglutination) and HIF (histo-immunofluorescence) methods, in order to evaluate the reliability of each method. For half of the mummies (7) the results were concordant on all samples (3-9 samples for each mummy) with all employed methods, suggesting an unequivocal blood group conclusion. For the other seven mummies there were discordant results with the different methods and interpretation of the results was thus inconclusive. HIF seems to be the most reliable method as specific blood group substances are identified on specific histologic structures. Failure to detect tissular ABO antigens was mainly due to excessive resin impregnation.
MPO activity is critical for optimal microbicidal activity of normal PMNs. In the absence of MPO, auxiliary mechanisms protect most MPO-deficient hosts from clinically significant sequelae, except for some persons with diabetes mellitus who suffer severe candidal disease. However, given our limited knowledge of the clinical impact of MPO deficiency, histochemical staining of peripheral blood smears or MPO activity of isolated leukocytes should be assessed in patients with unexplained fungal disease or with suspected impaired host defenses. Recently isolated cDNA probes provide important tools for dissecting the molecular and cell biology underlying hereditary MPO deficiency and the link between MPO gene expression and myeloid differentiation.
SMS 201 995 is a new long acting analogue of somatostatin. We have investigated its effect on basal and meal stimulated secretion of gut hormones and have shown that after a single s.c. injection of 50 micrograms it lowers significantly the basal plasma levels of pancreatic polypeptide, secretin, motilin, pancreatic glucagon and insulin, it also effectively suppresses the postprandial release of pancreatic polypeptide, gastrin, secretin, gastric inhibitory peptide, pancreatic glucagon and insulin. Except for the usual brief discomfort of an injection, no symptoms or untoward effects were observed.
SMS 201-995 is an octapeptide analogue of natural somatostatin characterized by pharmacological properties similar to those of somatostatin itself. In addition, its serum half-life of about 60 minutes after i.v. injection is significantly longer than that of the natural compound. A patient with active bleeding from a peptic ulcer jejuni due to a Zollinger-Ellison syndrome was successfully treated with SMS 201-995. Bleeding stopped after continuous infusion (25 micrograms/h) within the first 24 hours of infusion. The serum gastrin concentration dropped from 3,300 pg/ml to 170 pg/ ml (normal range 40-100 pg/ml). Continuation of the treatment by subcutaneous injections of SMS 201-995 (100 micrograms twice daily) maintained serum gastrin concentrations between 300 to 400 pg/ml over a period of 8 months. Side effects have not been observed. Four subsequent endoscopic examinations have revealed no ulcer relapse.
SMS 201-995, a new long-acting, synthetic somatostatin analogue, dose 50 micrograms/h, given as a continuous intravenous infusion, completely abolished quinine-induced insulin release in 9 healthy Thai volunteers. Hyperinsulinaemia, which caused sustained hypoglycaemia in a 32-year-old post-partum Thai patient who was receiving intravenous quinine for falciparum malaria, was suppressed within 30 min of starting SMS 201-995, and the patient became fully conscious. This octapeptide antagonises the stimulatory effect of quinine on the pancreatic beta cell and is a specific therapy for life-threatening hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia complicating falciparum malaria.
CA1 pyramidal neurones were studied in rat in vitro hippocampal slices using standard intracellular and single-electrode voltage-clamp recording techniques to examine the actions of noradrenaline (NA). NA had two different effects on the resting membrane potential of pyramidal neurones; either a hyperpolarization accompanied by a decrease in membrane input resistance, or less commonly, a depolarization accompanied by an increase in input resistance. In many cells, both effects, a hyperpolarization followed by a depolarization were observed. The depolarization was mediated by a noradrenergic beta-receptor. The hyperpolarization was more difficult to characterize, but may result from alpha-receptor activation. NA reduced the amplitude and duration of the slow calcium-activated potassium after-hyperpolarization (a.h.p.) that follows depolarization-induced action potentials. This action of NA was mediated by beta 1-noradrenergic receptors. NA, in the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium, reduced the a.h.p. without reducing the size of the calcium action potential which preceded it. This was unlike the action of the calcium channel blocker, cadmium, which reduced the calcium action potential and the a.h.p. in parallel. Furthermore, NA did not reduce the amplitude of calcium or barium currents recorded under voltage clamp after blockade of potassium currents. A functional consequence of this blockade of the calcium-activated a.h.p. was a reduction of the accommodation of action potential discharge such that the excitatory responses of the neurone to depolarizing stimuli, such as glutamate application or current passed through the recording electrode, were enhanced. We conclude that the effects of NA on calcium-activated potassium conductance and on resting membrane potential can interact to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of hippocampal pyramidal neurone responsiveness.
SMS 201-995 is a new somatostatin analog which is 10-60 times more potent and specific than somatostatin as an inhibitor of GH and insulin release. The aim of this study was to assess its value as an adjunct to insulin therapy in insulin-dependent diabetic- (IDD) patients. Six IDD patients were studied. Their average insulin doses ranged from 22-46 U/day, and hemoglobin A1c levels varied between 6.5-11.5%. Two patients had background retinopathy and mild sensorimotor neuropathy. After 12 h of glucemic stabilization, the patients were kept normoglycemic by connecting them to the Biostator-GCIIS. The study entailed two parts in random order, in which standardised mixed meals were administered at 0800, 1400, and 2000 h with or without sc bolus injections of 50 micrograms SMS 201-995 immediately before meal ingestion. Plasma free insulin, C-peptide, GH, and glucagon were measured by RIA. Postprandial hyperglycemia was significantly diminished by SMS 201-995 after breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Insulin requirements, both total and 2-h postprandially, decreased significantly with a parallel reduction in free insulin levels. Postprandial glucagon levels also significantly decreased, but GH profiles were similar. In conclusion, the somatostatin analog SMS 201-995 has a potential value as an adjunct to insulin in the management of IDD patients.
SMS 201-995 (5-100 micrograms) injected subcutaneously in normal and type-2 diabetic subjects 30 min before a test meal caused dose-related suppression of plasma concentrations of insulin, glucagon, and several regulatory gut peptide hormones (gastrin, gastric inhibitory peptide, pancreatic polypeptide, secretin, neurotensin, and motilin). Effective hormone suppression was achieved even at the lowest dose of 5 micrograms. In the normal subjects SMS caused postprandial hyperglycaemia, but there was no overall deterioration in glucose tolerance in the type-2 diabetic patients. This suggests that counterregulatory hormones play an important part in the metabolic disturbance of type-2 diabetes.
SMS 201-995 (SMS) is a long-acting analog of somatostatin. We studied the effect of SMS (50-100 micrograms, sc, every 8 h) on serum GH in five patients with acromegaly. Serum GH decreased significantly in four of the five patients 4 h after SMS treatment. In two of the four patients, this reduction was not sustained for 7 h, but sustained reduction to normal GH concentrations did occur in the two patients who had basal serum GH levels below 15 ng/ml. In the two patients whose responses were not sustained for 7 h, a higher dose of SMS did not cause sustained reduction in GH. SMS was well tolerated, except for one episode of elevated serum aminotransferase levels. These results indicate that SMS-induced reductions in serum GH in patients with acromegaly are often not sustained despite SMS administration every 8 h and indicate that the insufficient duration of effect may limit its therapeutic efficacy.
SMS 201-995 (Sandostatin) was studied using low doses (50 to 100 micrograms) administered subcutaneously every 12 hours. A single 50-micrograms dose of SMS 201-995 effectively controlled gastric acid and blood gastrin levels for 12 hours in three patients with benign gastrinomas and was useful in their perioperative management. Higher doses of the agent (500 to 800 micrograms per day) had no effect on metastases in one of two patients with metastatic gastrinoma. In the other patient, one tumor shrank but the other continued to grow after three months of treatment while serum gastrin levels did not change. Cultured metastatic tumor tissue from this patient released different forms of gastrin; growth rates varied, independent of uptake of SMS 201-995, and gastrin release increased. A neonate with nesidioblastosis maintained normal blood glucose levels while receiving SMS 201-995 therapy following a 95 percent pancreatic resection. In two elderly patients with organic hypoglycemia--one with a single benign adenoma and one with multiple adenomatosis--the somatostatin analogue did not prolong the hypoglycemia-free interval. In nine patients with carcinoid syndrome, flushing was uniformly controlled with 50 micrograms of SMS 201-995 administered every eight to 12 hours. One of the nine required exocrine pancreatic replacement. After six months of treatment, three of the nine had no change in tumor size and one had remission of symptoms and stopped treatment. In two patients with vipoma, SMS 201-995 controlled diarrhea and reduced levels of vasoactive intestinal peptide; tumor necrosis occurred in one patient. In a patient with diabetic diarrhea unresponsive to all treatments, SMS 201-995 therapy controlled the diarrhea but did not interfere with control of the diabetes.
CAD codes for a trifunctional protein involved in the catalysis of the first three enzymatic activities in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, namely, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II (EC 6.3.5.5), aspartate transcarbamylase (EC 2.1.3.2), and dihydroorotase (EC 3.5.2.3). CAD regulation was studied in the human promyelocyte leukemic line HL-60 as it differentiated into monocytic or granulocytic lineages after induction by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or trans-retinoic acid and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, respectively. Within 12 h of induction of HL-60 cells with either inducer, total cellular levels of CAD RNA essentially disappeared. On the other hand, no apparent decreases in beta-actin RNA levels were seen even 48 h after HL-60 cells were induced, as compared with untreated cells. With nuclear runoff assays, it was clearly shown that the inactivation of CAD gene expression during the induction of HL-60 cells with either inducer was at the transcriptional level. The nuclear runoff experiments also demonstrated that the CAD gene expression was shut down in less than 4 h after induction, well before morphological changes were observed in these cells. At the enzymatic level, the activity of aspartate transcarbamylase, one of the three enzymes encoded by the CAD gene, decreased by about half within 24 h of induction, suggesting a CAD protein half-life of 24 h in differentiating HL-60 cells. Nevertheless, this means that significant levels of aspartate transcarbamylase activity remained even after the cells have stopped proliferating. From the RNA data, it is clear that CAD gene expression is rapidly turned off as promyelocytes begin to terminally differentiate into macrophages and granulocytes. We suspect that the inactivation of the CAD gene in induced HL-60 cells is a consequence of the differentiating cells leaving the cell cycle and becoming nonproliferating.
SMS 201-995, a long-acting somatostatin analog, was given as the initial treatment to an acromegalic patient. SMS 201-995 (200 micrograms, sc, three times daily) reduced, but did not normalize, serum GH levels. Complete and prolonged control of GH secretion was obtained with a 600-micrograms daily continuous sc infusion (CSI), and the patient was treated in this way for 6 months. Rapid improvement of clinical signs and symptoms of acromegaly occurred, as did major tumor shrinkage. The other pituitary functions did not change. After 6 months, the daily SMS 201-995 dose was progressively reduced; GH secretion remained suppressed. After 12 months of treatment, GH secretion was controlled with a CSI of 100 micrograms SMS 201-995 daily, but not with two daily sc 100-micrograms injections. Further significant reduction in tumor size occurred. We conclude that CSI of SMS 201-995 resulted in constant GH normalization and marked clinical and morphological improvement. This form of treatment should be considered as an alternative to ablative treatment of acromegaly.
SMS 201-995 (Sandostatin) is an octapeptide which differs in its action from native somatostatin in four ways: 1) it inhibits GH hormone secretion in preference to insulin secretion; 2) it can be administered subcutaneously or even orally; 3) it is long-acting (t1/2 after sc administration 113 min), and 4) there is no rebound hypersecretion of hormones when the effect of the analogue lingers off. In this paper a guide is offered for the use of Sandostatin in the treatment of acromegaly (after unsuccessful operation and/or radiotherapy) and of metastatic endocrine pancreatic tumours and carcinoids. A dose regimen for these two types of patients is suggested and the adverse reactions which can be expected are summarized. In addition, preliminary data are shown and the limitations are discussed of possible future indications of the analogue in the treatment of cancer, diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal diseases.
SMS 201-995 (SMS), a synthetic analogue of somatostatin (SRIF) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of the hypersecretion of hormones such as in acromegaly. However, little is known about the effects of SMS on the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in normal subjects. In this study, plasma TSH was determined with a highly sensitive immunoradiometric assay, in addition to the concentration of SMS in plasma and urine with a radioimmunoassay, following subcutaneous injection of 25, 50, 100 micrograms of SMS (4 subjects/dose) or a placebo (6 subjects) to normal male subjects, at 0900 h after an overnight fast. The plasma concentrations of SMS were dose-responsive and the peak levels were 1.61 +/- 0.09, 4.91 +/- 0.30 and 8.52 +/- 1.18 ng/ml, which were observed at 30, 15 and 45 min after the injection of 25, 50 and 100 micrograms of SMS, respectively. Mean plasma disappearance half-time of SMS was estimated to be 110 +/- 3 min. Plasma TSH was suppressed in a dose dependent manner and the suppression lasted for at least 8 hours. At 8 hours after the injection of 25, 50 and 100 micrograms of SMS, the plasma TSH levels were 43.8 +/- 19.4, 33.9 +/- 9.4 and 24.9 +/- 3.2%, respectively, of the basal values. The results suggest that SMS suppresses secretion of TSH from the normal thyrotrophs in man and thus also that attention should be paid to possible hypothyroidism during the long-term treatment of patients such as those with acromegaly with this potent analogue of SRIF.
HPD is known to localize in neoplastic cells and when exposed to the appropriate wavelength of light causes cytotoxicity. The authors have established a rat urothelial cell model for use in comparing and contrasting the effects of HPD photodynamic therapy (PDT) in normal (RBL-01) and transitional cell carcinoma (AY27) bladder cell lines. Uptake, toxicity, and morphologic damage following exposure to HPD PDT were evaluated. Trypan blue exclusion was used for determination of the toxicity of several HPD concentrations (1, 10, 25, and 50 micrograms/ml) with increasing duration of incubation with HPD (0, 1, 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 hours). Both cell lines displayed increased toxicity with higher concentrations of HPD; however, the AY27 cells were more susceptible to the toxic effects of HPD PDT than the RBL-01 cells at the higher HPD doses studied (25 and 50 micrograms/ml). Viability decreased with increased duration of HPD incubation in RBL-01 cells up until 4 hours, after which it showed a steady increase. Viability decreased in the AY27 cells with increased duration of HPD incubation. An increase in serum concentration in the medium resulted in an increase in viability for both cell lines. Both cell lines demonstrated fast initial uptake of HPD followed by slower uptake over the time studied. By 24 and 48 hours the AY27 cells contained twice the amount of methanol-extractable porphyrins as the RBL-01 cells. The initial morphologic change following HPD PDT was damage to mitochondria. Mitochondrial damage occurred immediately after PDT in the AY27 cells and 30 minutes after PDT in the RBL-01 cells. Both cell lines exhibited a similar progression of cell injury; however, morphologic damage was observed earlier after PDT and appeared more extensive in the AY27 cells.
PGM1 and CAII polymorphisms were studied in four population samples of the Central African Republic (Mbugu and Sango) and of Benin (Goun and Nago). The results are compared with those reported on other African populations.
GALT contains Tcs cells which protect IgA responses under conditions of oral tolerance. Oral immunization of erythrocyte antigen induces antigen-specific Tcs cells in Peyer's patches which predominantly support IgA responses with minor IgM and IgG responses upon adoptive transfer to tolerized mice. On the other hand, systemically-primed mice possess Tcs cells which convert oral tolerance to only IgM and IgG responses. In general, effector Tcs cells which abrogate antigen-specific oral tolerance are Lyt-1+, Lyt-2-, L3T4-, I-J+ and V. villosa-adherent. Interestingly, these Tcs cells express T3 molecules which suggest the expression of a TCR which may account for their antigen specificity.
PGM3 polymorphism was studied in 301 placenta samples from the Negroid population of Northeastern Brazil. The following gene frequencies were encountered: PGM3*1 = 0.545 and PGM3*2 = 0.455. They lie between European and African gene frequencies. The prevalent Black and White admixture of Northeastern Brazil populations fits well with the observed gene frequencies. Two samples exhibited variant electrophoretic patterns.
PGM1 subtypes of 275 Chinese living in the Guangzhou area were determined using isoelectric focusing. The allele frequencies of PGM1 were 1+ = 0.6036, 1- = 0.1018, 2+ = 0.2200, and 2- = 0.0673. A rare variant, named PGM1*8, was found with a gene frequency of 0.0073. The phenotype distribution was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
SMS 201-995 is an octapeptide analogue of somatostatin. The effect of a single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of 50 micrograms SMS 201-995 on post-prandial intermediary metabolism was investigated in normal subjects. In spite of a long-lasting post-prandial suppression of insulin secretion, there were no significant changes in the plasma concentration of alanine, glycerol, 3-OH-butyrate or lactate. However, SMS 201-995 impairs carbohydrate tolerance, probably due to inhibition of insulin secretion. Basal and post-prandial plasma concentrations of the gut regulatory peptides pancreatic glucagon, motilin, pancreatic polypeptide, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, enteroglucagon, gastrin and peptide YY were suppressed up to 5 hours after subcutaneous administration of a single dose of SMS 201-995.
CAT scans used postreduction to evaluate possible complications or problems in children treated for congenitally dislocated hips can provide special data regarding the adequacy of reduction.
CA1 pyramidal cells responded to baclofen with a hyperpolarization. This response was found in the apical and basal dendrites and, like the hyperpolarizing response of the dendrites to GABA, appeared to be Ca2+-dependent since it was blocked or reduced by intracellular injection of EGTA or extracellular application of cadmium. Baclofen also reduced the excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials produced by stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals. The pre- and postsynaptic effects on the synaptic waveform could be distinguished.
ABO blood group was analyzed in 70 patients with hydatidiform mole and 53 patients with malignant trophoblastic disease. 319 healthy pregnant women served as controls. The distribution of ABO blood groups in patients with hydatidiform mole did not deviate significantly from the distribution in the controls. There was a slight excess in group AB and a slight deficiency in group O in patients with hydatidiform mole. However, there was a significant decrease in blood group A and a slight excess in groups O, B and AB in patients with malignant trophoblastic disease compared with the distribution in healthy pregnant women. A higher mortality rate was observed in group B in patients with malignant trophoblastic disease. In conclusion, ABO blood group of patients with malignant trophoblastic disease can be an important prognostic factor in the diagnosis and treatment of the trophoblastic disease, if a large number of cases are compiled by many investigators.
CAT scan by thin slices offers the possibility of evaluation of the bone structures of the ear and their contents. The progressively increasing availability of the scanner should make access much more routine for study of the ear, with a concomitant reduction in tomographies, inadequate in a large number of circumstances. The 4 main indications are chronic otitis with cholesteatoma, trauma, acoustic neuromas and malformations. The respective performances of tomography and CAT scan in each of these situations are discussed and an investigation strategy is suggested.
CA1 population spikes recorded in the rat hippocampal slice were used to assess quantitatively the potencies of GABA-receptor agonists and antagonists on mammalian CNS neurones. Apart from GABA itself, GABA A-receptor agonists inhibited the CA1 population spikes with potencies that correlated closely (r = 0.96) with their ability to displace [3H]-GABA from GABAA-binding sites. The low potency of GABA in this preparation was attributed to the action of uptake processes as the GABA uptake inhibitor, cis-4-hydroxynipecotic acid (2 X 10(-4) M), produced an approximate 6 fold increase in the potency of GABA whilst having no effect on the potency of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo [5,4-c] pyridin-3-ol (THIP), a GABAA-receptor agonist which is not a substrate for the GABA uptake system. The inhibitory effects of the selective GABAA-receptor agonists isoguvacine and muscimol were antagonized by bicuculline methochloride, which shifted the dose-response curves to the right in a parallel manner. The Schild plots for bicuculline methochloride against isoguvacine and muscimol had slopes of 1 and gave pA2 values of 6.24 and 6.10, respectively. Picrotoxin also antagonized the inhibitory effects of isoguvacine and produced parallel shifts to the right of the dose-response curve. However, the Schild plot for picrotoxin had a slope significantly less than unity (0.82) and gave a pA2 value of 6.89. The novel GABAA-receptor antagonist, pitrazepin, antagonized the inhibitory effects of isoguvacine in an apparently competitive manner. The Schild plot had a slope of 1 and gave a pA2 of 6.69. 6 The inhibitory effects of baclofen, GABA and kojic amine were not antagonized by GABAAreceptor antagonists and were presumed to be mediated by actions at GABA5-receptors. 7 The inhibitory effects of THIP and isoguvacine were antagonized with the same potency by bicuculline methobromide. These results do not support the suggestion that THIP acts preferentially at a 'synaptic' bicuculline-sensitive, GABA receptor. 8 It is concluded that the CAI population spike in the rat hippocampal slice is a useful test system for the quantitative analysis of both GABAA- and GABAB-receptor agonists and antagonists.
DBI (diazepam-binding inhibitor) is a putative neuromodulatory peptide isolated from rat brain that acts on gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine-Cl- ionophore receptor complex inducing beta-carboline-like effects. We used a cDNA probe complementary to DBI mRNA and a specific antibody for rat DBI to study in rat brain how the dynamic state of DBI can be affected after protracted (three times a day for 10 days) treatment with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide by oral gavage. Both the content of DBI and DBI mRNA increased in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex but failed to change in the hippocampus and striatum of rats receiving this protracted benzodiazepine treatment. Acute treatment with diazepam did not affect the dynamic state of brain DBI. An antibody was raised against a biologically active octadecaneuropeptide (Gln-Ala-Thr-Val-Gly-Asp-Val-Asn-Thr-Asp-Arg-Pro-Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Leu-Lys ) derived from the tryptic digestion of DBI. The combined HPLC/RIA analysis of rat cerebellar extracts carried out with this antibody showed that multiple molecular forms of the octadecaneuropeptide-like reactivity are present and all of them are increased in rats receiving repeated daily injections of diazepam. It is inferred that tolerance to benzodiazepines is associated with an increase in the turnover rate of DBI, which may be responsible for the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor desensitization that occurs after protracted benzodiazepine administration.
ACE is a carboxy-terminal peptidyl dipeptidase which can be produced by granuloma macrophages and possibly by other components of the granuloma. ACE activity is influenced by regulatory T cells. This enzyme may be important in mediating and/or modulating inflammation. One mechanism involves the generation of angiotensin II which can effect inflammatory reactions. Although unstudied, ACE may also be an important inactivator of bradykinin and various neuropeptides which in turn may participate in the immunoregulation of the granuloma. Thus, therapeutic strategies designed to alter ACE activity within granulomas may alter the size, composition and ultimate resolution of these lesions.
SMS 201-995 was administered to 40 acromegalic patients, in a multicentric study. Some of the results have been analyzed from 37 patients who remained under a long term treatment. Clinical improvement was noted in most patients, especially as concerns soft tissue swelling, sweating, headache. Digestive adverse effects were noted, leading to the drop-out from the protocol (in 4 patients) or in most patients to a slight discomfort related to increasing doses. There was an effect for all the doses used (300, 600, 900, 1500 micrograms in 3 subcutaneous injections per day), compared with pretreatment values, if we consider the mean GH value of each cycle obtained under the different dosages. The highest dose was most effective than the lowest in some cases. However in most patients the 300 micrograms dose was efficient. We could not obtain normalization of GH secretion. However 22/37 patients could reach a good score as concerns the number of GH values less than 5 micrograms/l, during circadian evaluations. In 5/37 patients, the antisecretory effect was insufficient (mean GH above 50% of the pretreatment level). Reduction in tumor volume was highly significant (more than 50%) in 2/11 patients. In conclusion, this study shows the efficacy of SMS 201-995 in improving clinical signs and symptoms of acromegaly, and GH hypersecretion in approximately 80% of the patients. General and metabolic tolerance are rather good. Some points concerning tolerance remain to be investigated.
ABO blood group incompatibility is of major concern because the antibodies frequently cause intravascular destruction leading to the most clinically severe complications. Irregular erythrocyte antibodies seldom cause intravascular destruction. However, when the antibodies bind complement and are present in high concentration the extravascular destruction occurs predominantly in the liver and may cause a clinically severe reaction with hemoglobinemia, shock and DIC. Those IgG class antibodies which do not bind complement cause a spleen-mediated, more or less drastically shortened life span of the red cells with unpleasant but usually not life threatening consequences for the patient. The transfusion reaction may occur with a delay of several days. Compatibility testing may consist of either a cross-match performed in such a way that both ABO incompatibility and irregular antibodies are detected, or a type-and-screen procedure. In the latter a computerized delivery control checking the patient's previous serological history and the donor/recipient compatibility is a recent improvement and rationalization. In an acute situation a reduction of the normal security measures may be necessary. The clinician responsible for the patient must know the time needed for carrying out an acute blood group determination and compatibility test in the hospital and must give instructions about what normal security measures that should be refrained from. Blood group incompatible transfusions have nowadays a much better prognosis than earlier, provided a rapid diagnosis can be made and appropriate treatment can be started promptly. Formation of antibodies against leukocyte/thrombocyte antigens is a frequent consequence of transfusion which, however, can be prevented by modern blood component therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
LPL activity, total lipogenesis and rates of growth were determined for stromal-vascular cells derived from epididymal and inguinal depots of 13 1/2-week-old obese and lean Zucker rats. LPL activity, in cells of both depots, was found to increase between days 4 and 6 and decrease by day 8 in the presence of insulin. Inguinal derived fatty cell LPL activity increased between days 4 and 8 in contrast to lean cells which peaked at day 6 under basal growth conditions. LPL activity was elevated in fatty versus lean cells at days 6 and 8 in inguinal derived stromal vascular cells while in epididymal derived stromal vascular cells, LPL activity was elevated in lean versus fatty derived cells at day 4 and 6 but by day 8 the genotypic effect was reversed. Lipogenesis was elevated in lean versus fatty derived epididymal and inguinal cells at all concentrations of insulin and lean cells showed a dose-dependent response to insulin in contrast to fatty cells. There were no effects of genotype on the proliferative capacity of cells from either depot but some regional differences in growth were observed. These data illustrate that fa gene effects can be studied in primary cell culture.
DAO activity in tissues of female guinea pigs was determined after the administration of estradiol or progesterone. Estradiol pretreatment elicited significant fall in DAO activity in the liver and specific increase in the uterus. The effect of progesterone was much less pronounced.
ACE inhibitors have emerged as important pharmacologic agents for treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Attenuation or inhibition of angiotensin mediated vasoconstriction appears to be the principal mechanism for the reduction of arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance.
"CSAD provides a challenge for the vascular surgeon. Patients are older, sicker, and at greater risk than are patients with unisegmental disease. Similarly, symptoms are more severe and limb loss is more frequent. A multitude of different reconstructive techniques are available, but their injudicious or untimely use can not only fail to improve the patient but can also cause limb loss or death. Their use must be predicated by a differentiation of which arterial segments are hemodynamically involved, yet this determination may not be possible even after extensive noninvasive and invasive investigation. To optimize the approach to these patients, the following principles should be employed. First, incapacitating claudication is a valid indication for a suprainguinal inflow procedure in a good-risk patient. However, indications for surgery should usually be limited to limb salvage, especially if an infrainguinal procedure is contemplated. Medical conditions such as heart failure and diabetes should be improved before arteriography. The latter should delineate the entire infrarenal arterial system, with special attention to the iliac, deep femoral, and pedal arteries. Oblique views may be of critical importance. Noninvasive hemodynamic tests should be used to confirm the need for arterial reconstruction and help delineate areas of functional stenosis. Direct pull-through pressure measurements may be required for ultimate confirmation. If proximal disease is thus defined, as proximal inflow operation should usually be sufficient unless there is extensive gangrene of the foot, in which case synchronous distal grafts may be required. If the proximal graft alone is performed, the patient must be followed closely since approximately 10% of patients may need subsequent distal reconstructions. The role of the ""runoff"" segments such as the deep femoral artery, popliteal trifurcation, and pedal arteries may be critical. Every effort should be made to ensure flow through these vessels. Profundoplasty alone is seldom indicated but is often a valuable adjunct to other reconstructive procedures. Lumbar sympathectomy is seldom required. PTA is becoming a valuable adjunct to treatment of CSAD, and intraoperative dilatation also has potential attributes. If such an approach is followed, lasting limb salvage with minimal morbidity should be achieved in most patients with CSAD."
STS 267 [1; 16 alpha-azido-3-methoxy-estra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-one] was found to have lipid shifting and fertility inhibitory effects in rats. In preclinical studies the metabolic fate of 1 was investigated in the rat. Demethylation in 3-position, reduction of the 17-carbonyl to the 17 beta-hydroxyl group, and for the first time the epimerization of the 16 alpha-azido to the 16 beta-azido group were established following perfusion of STS 267 in the isolated rat liver. From the perfusion medium 16 alpha-azido-estra-1,3,5(10)-trien-3-ol-17-one (2), 16 alpha-azido-estra-1,3,5(10)-trien-3,17 beta-diol (3), 16 beta-azido-3-methoxy-estra-1,3,5(10)-trien-3,17 beta-diol (4) and 16 beta-azido-estra-1,3,5(10)-trien-3,17 beta-diol (5) as the main metabolite were isolated by TLC and identified by comparison with authentic samples. The extent of the hepatic extraction of 1 in the rat liver was significant lower compared with mestranol.
"SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were used to examine soluble proteins from the eyes of six species of cephalopods i.e. Lolliguncula brevis, Sepia officinalis, Octopus maya, Octopus bimaculoides, Rossia pacifica and Loligo opalescens. All species had a protein (""IRBP"") with molecular weight virtually identical with vertebrate interstitial retinol-binding protein (IRBP) averaging 132,400 +/- 700 (n = 6). ""IRBP"" reacted on nitrocellulose blot transfers with rabbit antibovine IRBP and rabbit antifrog IRBP antibodies. Unlike vertebrate IRBP, cephalopod ""IRBP"" (from L. brevis) did not bind exogenous retinol or concanavalin A. The N-terminal amino acid appeared to be blocked in samples electroeluted from SDS gels. The antifrog IRBP antibodies also reacted with a series of proteins with molecular weights between 46,000 and 47,000, identified as retinal-binding protein (RALBP) with anti-RALBP antibodies. Anti-IRBP also reacted with pure RALBP prepared from Todarodes pacificus. Occasionally, anti-RALBP antibodies were seen to react weakly with ""IRBP"" in some cephalopods. We conclude that RALBP, cephalopod ""IRBP"" and vertebrate IRBP share a common but distant ancestry, and that a protein resembling IRBP appeared before the vertebrates diverged from the invertebrates. Both RALBP and IRBP appear to have analogous functions in shuttling retinoids between rhodopsin and the corresponding isomerizing system, retinochrome in the cephalopods and retinol isomerase in the vertebrates. The function of cephalopod ""IRBP"" is unknown."
ABO incompatibility of the newborn is one instance where immune hemolysis may present with a negative direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and therefore a simple sensitive test for detecting sensitization would be useful in this clinical situation. To evaluate the usefulness of ELAT in detecting in-vivo sensitized red cells, 1608 maternal-baby pairs were screened for ABO incompatibility over a period of 10 mth. Of 251 ABO-incompatible babies, there were 49 (19.5%) with positive DAT, but an additional 67 (26.7%) were ELAT positive. These were eluate positive as well, indicating that the increased number with sensitized cells as shown by ELAT is due to detection of in-vivo sensitized cells. The positive predictive value for ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) is 48%, which is two times that of DAT. Calculating the difference of the absorbance from baseline (delta OD) may give an indication of degree of sensitization which together with the maternal antibody titre would aid us in the estimation of antigen dosage on the baby's red cells and in the appraisal of the role of antigen dosage in HDN.
MIP and MP70 are putative gap junction components in the plasma membranes of the mammalian lens fibre cells. We show now that MP70 can be solubilized separately from MIP in mild detergent solutions, and that this treatment results in the dissociation of the fibre gap junctions. Solubilized MP70 was isolated as 16.9 S particles by velocity gradient centrifugation and in the electron microscope had the appearance of short double-membrane structures consistent with connexon-pairs. These observations open a new experimental avenue in which to characterize separately the two putative lens gap junction proteins structurally and functionally.
ABO blood group and secretor status were determined in healthy subjects in relation to oral carriage of Candida albicans, using a mouthwash technique to identify carriers and non-carriers. Of 100 subjects studied, 32% carried Candida, the main species isolated being C. albicans (94% isolates). Carriage of C. albicans was significantly associated with blood group O (p less than 0.001) and independently, with non-secretion of blood group antigens (p less than 0.001), with the trend towards carriage being greatest in group O non-secretors. This suggests that in healthy subjects, blood group O and non-secretion of blood group antigens are separate and cumulative risk factors for oral carriage of C. albicans.
"ALAD is a cytoplasmic enzyme that catalyzes the second step of the heme biosynthesis pathway, that is, the condensation of two molecules of delta-aminolevulinic acid into porphobilinogen. ALAD is a zinc-dependent enzyme; thiol groups are essential for its activity; and in vitro experiments show that ALAD can be activated or inhibited by several metal ions including A;3+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Ag2+, and Cu2+. To explain these effects, it has been postulated that metals bind to thiol groups of allosteric sites and, according to their structure, provoke allosteric transitions to the active or inactive form of the enzyme. Under current environmental and occupational exposure levels, lead is practically the only metal that can affect ALAD activity. Erythrocyte ALAD is the most sensitive indicator of lead exposure: effects of exposure are detectable even when blood lead levels are within the ""normal"" range. Zinc protects ALAD in vitro and in vivo from the inhibitory effect of lead. There is also some suggestion that aluminum could be responsible for the decreased erythrocyte ALAD activity observed in patients on chronic hemodialysis."
CA1 pyramidal neurons are selectively vulnerable to ischemia. 2-[14C]Deoxyglucose (2-DG) autoradiography was employed to measure local glucose utilization in the rat hippocampus after transient ischemia, under the condition of unilateral prevention of ischemic CA1 pyramidal cell necrosis by unilateral lesioning of Schaffer collaterals (left side). Columnar 2-DG uptake patterns in the CA1 region with intact Schaffer collaterals (right side) was observed 19-22 h after recirculation, though no laterality was noted 3 and 8 h after recirculation. In the right subiculum, higher 2-DG uptake was observed 19-22 h after recirculation in 5 out of 8 animals. These results suggest that Schaffer collaterals play a role in modulating glucose metabolism in the CA1 and subiculum during recirculation.
GPT variants, GPT2C-1 and GPT2A-2C, were found in samples from a mother and her child, respectively, in a disputed paternity case. The phenotype GPT 2C-1 was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed at alkaline pH and acidic pH; this is probably the first GPT*2C-1 detected in Japanese. It was considered that the GPT 2C allele in this family was inherited in a manner of autosomal codominant transmission.
ALAD is a zinc metalloenzyme whose inhibition by lead is the first and most sensitive indicator of lead exposure and whose decreased activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lead poisoning. This heme biosynthetic enzyme is encoded by a gene located at chromosome 9q34, which has two codominant alleles, ALAD1 and ALAD2. The occurrence of two frequent alleles for ALAD stimulated an investigation into the possible pharmacogenetic role of the enzyme polymorphism in lead poisoning. In a New York City population at high risk for lead exposure, individuals heterozygous or homozygous for the less common allele, ALAD2, had blood lead levels greater than or equal to 30 micrograms/dl more frequently than expected. These findings suggest a potential genetic susceptibility to lead poisoning in individuals with the ALAD 1-2 and 2-2 phenotypes.
ABO blood groups and haptoglobin types have been studied with special reference to their association with unipolar and bipolar affective disorders. The associations of serogenetic markers show statistically significant differences between unipolars and controls, bipolars and controls, and unipolars and bipolars. The results are largely in agreement with those reported in previous studies.
ADA specification No. 32 for determining the range (elastic limit) of orthodontic wires uses the bending of a wire section treated as a cantilever beam. An alternative method for defining the range of orthodontic wires proposed by Waters (1981) is to wrap wire sections around mandrels of varying diameters and measure the deformation imparted after unwrapping. Four brass mandrels with a total of 46 test diameters ranging from 3.5 to 60.0 mm were used in this study. Wire sections 9 cm in length were rolled on the mandrel with a hand lathe. The mandrel cross section required to produce a predetermined amount of deformation (2 mm arc height for a 5 cm chord) was defined as the yield diameter for that particular wire. No individual wire was tested twice so as to avoid introduction of strain history. Test samples of 488 different orthodontic wires supplied by nine commercial distributors were evaluated (a total of 4,747 samples). Stainless steel wires of identical dimensions had a large variation in range, depending on the state of strain hardening and heat treatment. For example, 0.020 inch round wire had yield diameters ranging from 22.8 mm for Australian special plus orange (TP Laboratories) to 42.9 mm for Nubryte gold (G.A.C. International). Chromium cobalt wires had less range than stainless steel before heat treatment, but increased greatly in range after heat treatment. Nitinol (Unitek) had the greatest range of all wires tested (yield diameter of 8.7 mm for 0.016 inch Nitinol). Multistranded stainless steel wires had yield diameters between 9.0 and 14.0 mm.
SPR in the DREZ, which was introduced in 1972 by the senior author on the bases of anatomical studies in humans, selectively interrupts the (lateral) nociceptive and the (central) myotatic fibers, while sparing the (medial) lemniscal fibers. In addition it enhances the inhibitory mechanisms of the Lissauer's tract and dorsal horn. The procedure was effective--with a follow-up ranging from 1 to 14 years--in 93% of the paraplegic patients with flexion-adduction postures (50 cases) or severe hyperextension (3 cases) and in 89% of the hemiplegic patients with irreducible flexion of the upper extremity (23 cases) or lower limb (5 cases).
IDS is a soluble glycoprotein product of activated T cells that inhibits lymphocyte proliferation induced by antigens and by lectin mitogens. This immunosuppressive lymphokine has been distinguished from lymphotoxin, Proliferation Inhibitory Factor, Colony Inhibitory Factor, Macrophage Inhibitory Factor, and interferon. Using IDS partially purified by isoelectric focusing from culture supernatants of concanavalin A-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), we investigated IDS inhibition of T cell proliferation with respect to the interleukin pathway. At concentrations that produced 75-90% suppression of proliferation in PHA-stimulated PBMC cultures, IDS caused no decrease in interleukin 2 (IL2) production (determined by bioassay) or in IL2 receptor expression (determined with anti-Tac antibody). Moreover, adding exogenous IL2 to IDS-inhibited cultures failed to restore proliferation. IDS inhibited growth of several IL2-dependent and IL2-independent cell lines, and suppressed proliferation of PBMC induced by the phorbol ester TPA (12-0-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol acetate) or by the calcium ionophore A23187, thus distinguishing its mechanism of action from that of cyclosporin A, dexamethasone, OKT11A antibody, and other inhibitors. These data extend earlier findings that IDS acts late in G1 phase of the cell cycle, and provide evidence that IDS inhibits T cell proliferation through an IL2-independent mechanism.
PC IOLs appear to be safe and effective and there are few contraindications. Based on the available data we feel confident about implanting PC IOLs in healthy eyes of patients aged 40 or older. For younger patients, we do not recommended an IOL unless glasses or contact lens use is not feasible. Caution is urged however in the use of semiflexible, closed-loop AC IOLs as well as 'soft' PC IOLs. Other questions regarding material of choice, bag versus sulcus fixation, and UV absorbers remain controversial.
ACE inhibitors are not available in India. Response to captopril in comparison with M-dopa was therefore seen in Indian hypertensive patients. A double blind randomized non-crossover study was carried out on 39 adult patients of either sex suffering from essential hypertension. Twenty-five patients included were resistant to earlier drug therapy. The remaining 14 were freshly detected hypertensive patients. Patients received either 150 mg/day captopril (Aceten) or 750 mg/day M-dopa in 3 equally divided doses every day for 30 days. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in captopril (Aceten) group before starting drug therapy was 171 +/- 4.11 (mean +/- SE) and 111 +/- 0.22, respectively. At the end of therapy the systolic blood pressure was 132 +/- 1.86 and diastolic blood pressure was 84 +/- 1.36 mm of mercury. This fall in the blood pressure within the group was statistically highly significant (p less than 0.001). Similarly patients on M-dopa produced statistically highly significant fall in blood pressure (p less than 0.001) at the end of 4 weeks therapy. Initial systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both groups were comparable and, at the end of 2 and 4 weeks therapy, patients on captopril (Aceten) showed greater fall in both systolic (p less than 0.001) and diastolic (p less than 0.005) blood pressure than patients on M-dopa. None of the patients in the trial demonstrated clinically significant changes in the biochemical parameters. Six of nineteen patients on methyl dopa had side effects which are well known to this drug. None in the captopril showed any side effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
ADA supports the achievement of comprehensive nutrition standards in day-care programs. Recommended standards focus on meeting the child's nutrition needs in a safe and pleasant environment that promotes sound physical, social, and emotional development. Staff and parents should be informed of the child care program's role in meeting the nutrition needs of enrolled children. Parents should be encouraged to participate actively in the program's nutrition activities to assure continuity in the child's nutrition education.
GPT and GLO-I phenotypes were determined by means of isoelectric focusing and starch gel electrophoresis, respectively, in a sample of the Galician population (Northwest Spain); GPT: n = 302, GLO-I: n = 500. The gene frequencies come to: GPT1 = 0.5099, GPT2 = 0.4901; GLO1 = 0.4930, GLO2 = 0.5070. No rare variants were found. The Galician gene frequencies are compared with those obtained on other populations from different parts of the world.
ABO blood group substances were determined in either the seminal plasma (male patients) or saliva of 100 infertile couples and 100 control subjects. Comprehensive infertility evaluation was performed in all patients. Results were analysed in groups of couples with respect to their ABO blood group and compared with fertile control subjects. Over 70% of fertile marriages were compatible. Comparison of infertile and fertile couples for either ABO compatibility or incompatibility did not reveal any statistically significant difference (P greater than 0.05). This suggests some measure of low zone tolerance to ABO antigens on spermatozoa, for only a small minority of sperm introduced during coitus gains access to the oviduct and ultimately to the peritoneal cavity.
G6PD variants of 13 patients from 12 German families with different clinical symptoms have been characterized kinetically. Vmax G6PD was nearly zero in red blood cells of all carriers. Therefore G6PD variants were isolated from leucocytes, which proved to be a suitable source for analysis of instable G6PD variants. The testing program included KmG6P, KmNADP, Ki values of NADPH, ATP and 2,3 P2G, rate of utilization of dG6P, Gal6P, dNADP, NAD, and pH dependence. From the results obtained one can conclude that all analyzed G6PD variants represent individual mutations. The degree of metabolic dysregulation can be explained by the different kinetic and physico-chemical properties of these G6PD variants.
PC 12h pheochromocytoma cells were subcutaneously transplanted into rat. We found the transplanted tumors accumulated some fucogangliosides associated with PC 12 cells. These gangliosides were isolated and purified by DEAE-Sephadex A-25 and Iatrobeads column chromatographies. Their structures were determined by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, permethylation study, and sequential degradation using various exoglycosidases and mild acid hydrolysis. Two tumor-associated fucogangliosides were found to possess the blood group B determinant as follows: G6: IV2Fuc alpha, IV3Gal alpha, II3NeuAc, GgOse4Cer; G11: IV2Fuc alpha, IV3Gal alpha, II3 (NeuAc)2, GgOse4Cer. A ganglioside with the similar structure as ganglioside G6 was isolated from rat hepatoma cells (Holmes, E.H., and Hakomori, S-I. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7698-7703). However, ganglioside G11 has not previously been reported in the literature. These fucogangliosides reacted with the monoclonal antibody prepared by immunizing mice with PC 12h cells. Other fucogangliosides were also found to accumulate in the transplanted tumor tissues. They were identified as fucosyl-GM1 and fucosyl-GDlb. These fucogangliosides did not react with the monoclonal antibody against PC 12h cells.
ABO blood group data from about 78,000 conscripts born 1900-1935 in Southeast Sweden have been analyzed for regional differentiation using a hierarchical subdivision of the area. Heterogeneity was present at all levels of division. Gene diversity among subpopulations has been compared to a corresponding estimate performed on data from the country of Västerbotten in northern Sweden.
ADA is a key enzyme in the mammalian purine salvage pathway. The lack of ADA activity has been linked to a lack of cellular immunity in various immune and myeloproliferative disorders. Data on its role in patients with solid tumors are scant and inconclusive. In this report, we have evaluated the activity of this enzyme in the peripheral lymphocytes of patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNC). The mean ADA activity in Stage IV patients (0.57 +/- 0.08 SEM, n = 12) was significantly lower than that of controls (1.55 +/- 0.25 SEM, P less than 0.05, n = 14) and also significantly lower that the mean ADA activity in patients with Stages I, II, and III (1.14 +/- 0.10 SEM, P less than 0.05, n = 17). Fourteen out of 19 controls, Stage I, II, and III patients had positive skin tests compared to 7 out of 10 Stage IV patients. These differences were not statistically significant. There was also no correlation between ADA activity and the absolute lymphocyte counts. Our results indicate that ADA activity in lymphocytes of patients with advanced HNC is lower than that of controls or patients with earlier stages of the disease. ADA may be a more sensitive indicator of suppressed cellular immunity than delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, or monitoring absolute lymphocyte counts.
ABO typing was successfully performed on 46 urine samples whose ABO group and secretor status had been determined previously from blood and saliva. Twenty-four urine samples were collected on which blind studies, time studies, and storage studies were performed. Multiple urines from several individuals were collected to evaluate the duplicity of the test. Also, urines were collected from pregnant and menstruating females to determine if ABO typing was affected under these conditions. Results of these studies are discussed.
SDS gel electrophoresis of microtubule proteins obtained from bovine brain by polymerization cycles revealed a new protein of 18 kDa. This protein was copolymerized with tubulin and its stoichiometry to tubulin remained constant for at least 5 cycles of assembly. Moreover, this protein remained bound to microtubules stabilized with 10 microM taxol and pelleted through a 4 M glycerol cushion. The same 18 kDa protein was found in a purified preparation of the high molecular mass microtubule-associated protein 1 (MAP-1). The 18 kDa protein copurified with the MAP-1 heavy chains during column chromatography on phosphocellulose, DEAE-cellulose, hydroxyapatite and Bio-Gel A-15m. Incubation of the MAP-1 preparation with a mouse monoclonal antibody to the light chain 1 (LC-1) of MAP-1 and with a second precipitating antibody (a rabbit antibody to mouse IgG) immunoprecipitated from the solution all the known components of MAP-1 (heavy chains, LC-1, LC-2), as well as the 18 kDa protein. Immunoblotting showed, however, that this antibody does not interact directly with the 18 kDa protein. These results indicate that the 18 kDa protein forms a complex with all other components of MAP-1. This polypeptide, therefore, is a new light chain (LC-3) of MAP-1.
PC Coloring Book, a software program for the personal microcomputers, is a helpful treatment modality in cognitive rehabilitation and also for upper extremity motor control refinement. In addition to the case described this program has been initiated with several other patients, including two adults with cerebral palsy who have had additional brain trauma and one 5-year-old who is developmentally delayed. We cannot yet assess the results because these patients have not used the program for a sufficient period of time. However, we have noted that with all patients the increase in motivation was greater with this program than with more conventional treatment modalities. We expect additional patient trials to provide more applications for this program and to support the increased use of personal computers and software for improving cognitive cells.
CAT scans were performed in 66 patients with neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood (infantile autism, attention deficit disorder, Tourette's disorder, and language disorder) and a control group of 20 medical patients. Ventricular volume and brain density were determined by quantitative, computer-based methods by researchers blind to the patients' diagnoses. There were no significant differences among diagnostic groups or between neuropsychiatric patients and medical control patients in total ventricular volume, right-left ventricular volume ratio, ventricular asymmetries, ventricle-brain ratios, or brain density.
ADA 202-718, as well as HEDS and higher homologues of ADA 202-718, were found to profoundly stimulate the delayed type hypersensitivity reaction in mice when given i.p. or orally in a dose range of 0.1 - 10 mg/kg. While even a single application of ADA 202-718 at the time of sensitization resulted in a stimulation of the hypersensitivity reaction, administration of the compound at the time of challenge was without effect. When ADA 202-718 was given to animals which were subjected to immunosuppressive therapy by cyclosporine, the suppressed hypersensitivity reaction was restored to normal. At much higher doses (50-200 mg/kg) ADA 202-718 enhanced the local graft-vs-host reaction in the rat. ADA 202-718 did not interfere with the suppressed graft-vs-host reaction obtained by immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporine nor with the immunosuppressed skin transplant rejection. Single applications of HEDS or ADA 202-718 enhanced the humoral response of mice to sheep erythrocytes as well as to haptenized sheep or chicken erythrocytes. Although antibody levels at the time of maximal antibody production (day 4 for IgM) were only moderately enhanced, elevated antibody titres (IgM and IgG) were found even 23 days after sensitization. The age-dependent decreased humoral response of mice to sheep erythrocytes tended to be partially restored by twice weekly oral applications of HEDS or ADA 202-718 (0.1 to 1 mg/kg for 4 weeks). ADA 202-718 did not decrease the swelling in the Freund's adjuvant induced arthritis in the rat, but reduced the pain in this model. Swelling in a locally induced oedema was reduced in a dose-independent fashion. ADA 202-718 was more effective than acetyl salicylic acid in alleviating the oedema-associated pain.
HDC is commonly used in conditions with a raised intracranial pressure. An effect on cerebral edema was first described in patients with brain tumors, where the intracranial pressure can be lowered following administration of HDC. However, the use of HDC in cerebral edema of other origin is not equally well supported. Apart from effects on brain circulation secondary to the effects of HDC on brain edema, direct effects of HDC on cerebral blood flow and oxygen uptake have been studied mainly in experimental endotoxic shock. Endotoxin given intravenously leads to reduction in the cerebral blood flow and increase in the oxygen uptake. The increased oxygen uptake could be due to circulating catecholamines or other substances affecting the cerebral metabolism following their passage of a damaged blood-brain barrier. Pretreatment with HDC prevents the effects of endotoxin on cerebral blood flow and oxygen uptake. When HDC was given after an intravenous endotoxin injection blood flow was unaffected but the increased cerebral oxygen uptake was reduced transiently. This might hypothetically be explained by either a direct effect on the permeability of the blood-brain barrier or indirectly via a decrease of metabolically active circulatory substances.
ABO and Rhesus blood group data were analysed from 43187 blood donors belonging to 34 ethnic groups, predominantly from northern Nigeria. This is the largest series to be reported on from the whole of West Africa. Group O was found in 46.6% of all those examined, but the numbers varied from 33.13% to 64.35% in different ethnic groups. Group A was found in 23.05% and Group B in 25.95%, but again there was much variation in the distribution of the blood groups in different ethnic groups. There was an overall frequency of 3.64% of Rhesus negatives, ranging from 1.4% to 8.72% in different ethnic groups. The results provide basic but useful information concerning many ethnic groups whose blood groups have not previously been reported.
ABO and rhesus (Rh) blood groups were examined in 124 patients with presenile dementia of the Alzheimer type (PDAT) and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT), and their distribution was compared with controls. No significant associations between these blood groups and Alzheimer's disease (AD) were found after statistical correction for multiple comparisons.
CAD is the leading cause of postoperative and late death following peripheral vascular reconstruction. In an attempt to reduce the eventual incidence of fatal myocardial infarction, preoperative coronary angiography was obtained in a series of 1000 patients under serious consideration for elective vascular procedures at The Cleveland Clinic. Those patients found to have severe, surgically correctable CAD were advised to undergo myocardial revascularization as a combined or preliminary operation. Severe, correctable CAD was discovered in 25% of the study group, including 34% of patients suspected to have CAD by conventional clinical criteria in comparison to only 14% of those who were not (p = 2.0 X 10(-13) ). Although severe CAD also was more common among men, patients more than 60 years of age, and diabetic patients, the clinical cardiac status was the most reliable indication of the yield of coronary angiography. Coronary artery bypass was performed in 216 patients, and the operative mortality rate for 1292 cardiac and vascular procedures was 2.6%. On the basis of this experience, an algorithm was constructed to select peripheral vascular patients for noninvasive cardiac screening or coronary angiography.
CAT scanning of calcaneal fractures with the 30 degree coronal or the transverse plane provides useful information not available on conventional roentgenograms. Joint alignment, displacement of fragments, and the integrity of the medial wall are key factors in deciding whether surgical reconstruction is indicated and what surgical approach to use--medial, lateral, or both. Examples of such information obtained on eight patients with calcaneal fractures is reported comparing CAT scan results to conventional roentgenograms. CAT scans can be used also with the foot immobilized in a cast.
ABO and Rhesus blood group data have been examined for 1,680 patients treated for gastric cancer in four London hospitals. The risk of developing gastric cancer was estimated to be 16% higher for group A subjects than for group O subjects, in close agreement with many previous reports throughout the world. More detailed analysis failed to support the suggestion that there was any special correlation between either ABO or Rhesus blood groups and the site of origin of the tumour within the stomach or the sex or age of the patient. Male predominance among the patients was noted to be greater at ages 40-69 years than at other ages and greater for tumours of the upper two thirds of the stomach than for tumours that arose distally.
CAT scan studies linking schizophrenia to structural pathology of the brain are critically reviewed. CAT findings implicate an irreversible, static process, probably occurring early in development and resulting in a reduction of brain mass. The specificity of the process cannot be assessed from CAT images. Clinical correlations suggest that greater structural change is associated with more clinical neurological signs, suggestive of a pathological continuum rather than a sub-group concept. The CAT images are consistent with recent postmortem evidence of limbic-diencephalic pathology in schizophrenia. A structural deficit hypothesis is proposed.
CA1 pyramidal cell is modeled by a linked series of passive compartments representing the soma and different parts of the dendritic tree. Intracellular postsynaptic potentials are simulated by conductance changes at one or more compartments. By assuming an infinite homogeneous extracellular medium and a particular geometrical arrangement of pyramidal cells, field potential profiles are generated from the current source-sinks of the compartments. The pyramidal cells are driven at the theta (theta)-frequency at different sites of the dendritic tree in order to simulate external driving of hippocampus by the septal cells. Inhibitory or excitatory driving at different sites gives extracellular dipole fields of different null zones and maxima. Phase reversal (180 degrees) of a dipole field generated by synchronous synaptic currents is completed within a depth of 150 micron. By driving two spatially distinct but overlapping dipole fields slightly phase-shifted (30-90 degrees) from each other, the resultant field shows a gradual phase shift of 180 degrees in over 400 micron depth and no (stationary) null zones. The latter field correspond to the theta-profiles seen in the freely moving rat. Somatic inhibition is proposed to be the synaptic process generating the theta-field potentials (named dipole I) in the urethananesthetized or curarized rat. Dipole I has amplitude maxima at the basal dendritic and the distal apical dendritic layers, with a distinct null zone and phase reversal at the apical side of the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Rhythmic distal dendritic excitation, time-delayed to somatic inhibition, is proposed to be the additional dipole (dipole II) found in freely moving rats. The combination of dipoles I and II, phase-shifted from each other, causes the gradual theta-field phase shift. Experimental studies indicate that dipole I is atropine-sensitive and probably driven by a cholinergic septohippocampal input, whereas dipole II is atropine-resistant and may come from a pathway through both the septum and the entorhinal cortex. Variations of the phase profiles of the theta-field in freely moving rats by administration of anesthetic and cholinergic drugs and by normal changes in theta-frequency could be accounted for by the proposed model. Changes of the intracellular membrane potential, cellular firing rate, and evoked excitability at different phases of the theta-rhythm in anesthetized and freely moving rats can be predicted from the model, and they are in general agreement with the extant literature. In conclusion, theta-field is generated by a rhythmic somatic inhibition phase-shifted with a distal apical-dendritic excitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
STS 557 (17 alpha-cyanomethyl-17 beta-hydroxy-estra-4, 9-dien-3-one) was tested for progestagenic activity in rabbits and for ovulation-inhibiting activities in rabbits and rats in comparison with levonorgestrel and, in some cases, with norethisterone acetate or chlormadinone acetate. In the immature rabbit, the endometrium transformation-inducing activity of STS 557 was about 5 times higher than levonorgestrel for both oral and subcutaneous administration. The ovulation-inhibiting effect of STS 557 was 3.5 times higher than that of levonorgestrel in the rabbit after oral administration, and about 7 times higher in the rat. After subcutaneous injection, however, the antiovulatory activity of STS 557 in rats was only about 4% of that of levonorgestrel when the ED 50 were compared.
SDS gel electrophoresis of troponin and myosin extracted from chicken myofibrils pretreated with Ca-activated neutral protease showed a pattern similar to that observed in the muscles of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, that is, a decrease in troponin-I and troponin-C with relative preservation of troponin-T and degradation of the heavy chain of myosin. Also, alpha-actinin and troponin-C were released from myofibrils. Two inhibitors of Ca-activated neutral protease, leupeptin and E-64, inhibited the degradative action of Ca-activated neutral protease on intact myofibrils in vitro.
CS comprises a group of disorders characterized by hypercortisolism. The variety of causes--pituitary-dependent CS (CD), adrenal tumor, and the ectopic ACTH syndrome--necessitates a variety of therapies--surgical, radiotherapeutic, and medical. Once a specific diagnosis is made, specific therapy can be instituted. Although some controversy persists regarding treatment, particularly that of CD, for most patients it is straightforward. However, in our experience with more than 60 patients, therapeutic dilemmas can arise in a number of circumstances, e.g. the patient with the radiologically normal sella or recurrent CD after adrenalectomy. In addition, the treatment of such conditions as the large ACTH-producing pituitary tumor, Nelson's syndrome, the malignant ectopic ACTH syndrome, and adrenal carcinoma is not entirely satisfactory. Our approach to these problems is illustrated by seven cases, and we emphasize that the proper management of CS requires both correct diagnosis and the logical application of all available therapies.
CAT scan is now the primary diagnostic procedure for intracranial lesions in children. It is particularly well-suited for investigating intracranial hypertension, tumors and other space-occupying lesions, hydrocephalus, and malformations. Because it is non-invasive, this technique tends to be unduly performed as a screening procedure, with a resulting oversaturation of neuroradiological facilities. CAT scan should not be used as a routine examination, but only in well-selected cases. Careful clinical assessment and a good knowledge of pediatric neurology are still essential. New techniques are now becoming available and neuroradiologists will be able to select the best investigation for each particular case.
ACE is a function of the endothelial cell that appears vital to integrative homeostatic physiology in stress. The endothelial cell, both in the lung and in systemic tissues, is uniquely situated to detect changes in ambient oxygen tension; thereafter, as exemplified by the effects of altered oxygen tension on ACE, the cell is capable of initiating changes that modulate its functions to reflect the altered physiologic state. Based upon extensive studies of endothelial cells propagated in tissue culture, these altered functions are rapid in onset, rapidly reversible, and quite closely correlated to PO2. Integrity of the endothelial cell membrane is necessary for the modulating changes to occur, and indeed, ACE purified from the cell is insensitive to changes in oxygen tension: it is the cell, not the enzyme, that responds to changes in oxygen tension (FIGURE 5). It is important to emphasize the interdependent nature of the several vasoactive systems. The kallikrein-kinin system, in addition to its putative role in blood pressure regulation, is an intimate component of both the coagulation and fibrinolysis plasma protease cascades. The sympathetic nervous system has multiple points of interdigitation in both the kallikrein-kinin and the renin-angiotensin systems; high levels of epinephrine stimulate renin release and activate both plasma and tissue kallikrein. In turn, both of the vasoactive peptides of these systems, bradykinin and angiotensin II, stimulate epinephrine production from the adrenal medulla. Angiotensin II enhances the potency of norepinephrine released from postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings, increasing alpha-adrenergic tone. In addition, multiple interactions have been described between angiotensin II and bradykinin and the formation of prostaglandins by endothelial cells. Preliminary data indicate that the potency of these peptides in causing prostanoid release is, as might be expected, closely correlated to ACE activity, which itself is a function of ambient PO2. These multiple interactions are diagrammed in FIGURE 9. It is noteworthy that the two fundamental regulators of the circulation, pH and PO2, can be shown to interact at the most basic level with endothelial cell function.
PAH transport and Na-K-ATPase activity markedly increase during the first month of postnatal life. Pretreatment of rats with PAH or cyclopenthiazide induces a stimulation of in vitro PAH accumulation in renal cortical slices, whereas Na-K-ATPase activity is unchanged in comparison to saline-pretreated controls. 5 mM ouabain in the incubation medium reduces PAH accumulation. Developmental pattern and stimulation effects are pronounced as in controls. The ouabain-insensitive component of net PAH accumulation progressively increases with age and is significantly enhanced following drug pretreatment, whereas the ouabain-sensitive component of net PAH accumulation shows relatively slight modifications. Consequently, Na-K-ATPase seems not to be linked with postnatal maturation or drug-induced stimulation in tubular PAH transport.
ACE has been measured in the seminal plasma of fertile and infertile men according to the method of Cushman and Cheung. High enzyme activity was found in fertile subjects which did not significantly differ from those with oligozoospermia and those with the Sertoli cell-only syndrome. Enzyme activity was significantly lower after vasectomy. The data suggest a higher enzyme/sperm cell ratio in oligozoospermia. Considerable enzyme activity in obstructive azoospermia can be attributed to enzyme formation within either the prostate or the seminal vesicles.
SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of an antigen isolated from sera of Wuchereria bancrofti-infected patients and Setaria digitata antigen SD2-4 is reported. Both antigens showed carbohydrate (glycoprotein) staining. The W. bancrofti antigen had an apparent relative molecular mass of 35 000 while the S. digitata antigen SD2-4 migrated at the marker dye position on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SDS treatment of these antigens did not abolish the precipitation reaction with antibody. In the case of W. bancrofti antigen, SDS treatment probably exposed hitherto hidden antigen epitopes.
CAT scanning of the orbit is greatly facilitated by the distinctly different absorption characteristics of the various orbital tissues. Intraorbital tumours can be defined accurately with respect to size, topographic position and extent. Differentiation between the benign or malignant character of orbital tumours is less well achieved by CAT scanning than by sonography; therefore sonography is needed as a complementary diagnostic modality.
"STS 557 (17 alpha-cyanomethyl-17 beta-hydroxy-estra-4, 9-dien-3-one) is a interceptive agent in rabbits, mice and rats. In rats, it also shows post-implantational pregnancyterminating activity. In rabbits treated orally before mating or after ovulation for three consecutive days, it inhibited pregnancy largely at total doses of 0.08 mg/kg in the former and completely with 8.0 mg/kg in the latter case. A single subcutaneous dose of 40 mg/kg given on day 1 of pregnancy inhibited completely nidation in rats. In inhibition of pregnancy in rats could also be realized when the dose of 40 mg/kg was distributed on several days and given subcutaneously at daily doses of 5.0 mg/kg on days 1--8 of pregnancy, and even only daily doses of 2 mg STS 557/kg were needed in this respect, if animals which showed no living conceptuses were scored as ""non-pregnant"". STS 557 was effective in terminating pregnancy in rats, too, when given subcutaneously after implantation for 4 days at daily doses of 50 mg/kg, beginning on day 5 or on day 8 of pregnancy. The nidation inhibiting effects of STS 557 in rabbits treated pre-coitally, and in mice as well as in rats treated post-coitally were more marked than those of levonorgestrel. The interceptive and post-implantational inhibiting activity of STS 557 may be based on its antiprogestagenic properties. Luteolysis in the nidation phase can be excluded as shown by radioimmunoassay of progesterone in rats. The antigestagenic effects on the endometrium in rats were evident in the diamine oxidase assay. The acceleration of tubal egg transport, the morphological changes of the endometrium shown by scanning electron microscopy, and the effects on blastocyst transfer, all investigated in rats, suggest peripheral mechanisms of action."
STS 557 (17 alpha-cyanomethyl-17 beta-hydroxy-estra-4, 9-dien-3-one) or levonorgestrel was given orally as a single dose of 0.4 mg per animal. Treatment was performed immediately after the 18 h or 6 h mating period. Regarding the 18 h mating period, in 30 control cycles (20 animals) 11 pregnancies (36.7%) and in 20 cycles (16 animals) with levonorgestrel treatment 2 pregnancies (10.0%) were observed. In 80 cycles (31 animals) with STS 557 treatment 7 pregnancies occurred (8.7%). With regard to the 6 h mating period, in 30 control cycles (18 animals) 9 pregnancies (30%) and in 26 cycles (17 animals) with levonorgestrel administration 3 pregnancies were recorded (11.5%). In 50 cycles (21 animals) with postcoital administration of STS 557 only two pregnancies occurred (4%). Therefore, after the 6 h mating period STS 557 showed high interceptive activities in this non-human primate model. In comparison with controls, STS 557 did not decrease the postovulatory rise of plasma progesterone. This finding demonstrates that postcoital STS 557 in the chosen dosage does not suppress ovulation. Repeated STS 557 administration starting early in the follicular phase was without marked influence on cycle characteristics. On the other hand, treatment start in the middle or at the end of the cycle caused cycle lengthening and reduced progesterone levels in some animals.
TH 2.52, a subline of the B cell hybridoma with Iab, Iad, and IgM molecules on the cell membrane, was treated with F(ab')2 fragments of purified goat anti-mouse mu antibody (anti-mu), and the change in the expression of surface Ia molecules was determined by microcytotoxicity assays, quantitative absorption tests, and analyses of flow microfluorometery (FMF). We have previously reported that TH 2.52 cells can markedly generate IgM after stimulation with anti-mu without T cell factors. In the present studies, it was shown that the expression of surface Iab molecules on TH 2.52, originated from normal B cells of C57BL/6 (B6) mice, significantly decreased after treatment with anti-mu. In contrast, Iad molecules derived from M12.4.1 lymphomas did not change under the same conditions. These results indicate that cross-linking of anti-mu with surface IgM molecules on TH 2.52 provides signals for differentiation into IgM-secreting cells; this is followed by a decrease in the expression of Iab molecules on the cell membrane. Furthermore, monoclonal anti-Ia antibody (anti-Ia) did not inhibit the generation of IgM-secreting cells by TH 2.52 cells treated with anti-mu. In addition, la- sublines of TH 2.52 obtained after mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), as well as the original TH2.52, could differentiate into IgM-secreting cells in the presence of anti-mu. These findings suggest very strongly that la molecules on the cell membrane are not required for the induction of IgM secretion by B cells treated with anti-mu.
ABO and Rhesus blood types have been specified in 2047 diseased newborns, diseased infants and children who died before the age of one, as well as in their mothers. 527 healthy children and their mothers were investigated as a control group. A significant difference in the ABO phenotype frequencies has been revealed between: i) healthy and dead children, ii) mothers of diseased newborns and mothers of healthy children, iii) dead children and their mothers. The significant increase in the incidence of maternal Rhesus-negative phenotype, as compared with the control group, was shown in the groups of diseased newborns, diseased infants and dead children. In the same groups, mothers differ significantly from their children with respect to the frequency of Rhesus phenotypes. The incidence of Rhesus-incompatible mother-child pairs in the groups of diseased newborns, diseased infants and dead children was shown to be two times higher than the respective frequency in the control group and the expected frequency. A certain increase in the frequency of ABO-incompatible pairs was revealed in the groups of diseased newborns and dead children, but the difference, as compared to the control group, did not prove to be statistically significant. A hypothesis was advanced to the effect that the mother-child incompatibility for Rhesus and ABO antigens may result not only in fetal wastage and haemolytic disease of newborns, but also in the decrease of child's resistance to diseases of different origin.
PGM1 subtypes were determined in red cell hemolysates by isoelectric focusing on agarose gel plates. By this modified procedure PGM1 subtypes may be readily classified. Nine of the 10 expected phenotypes were found in a sample of 470 unrelated individuals from Southern Germany. The frequencies for the four alleles were found to be: PGM1(1+) = 0.212, PGM1(1-) = 0.1224, PGM1(2+) = 0.2043, PGM1(2-) = 0.0521.
CAD is a multifunctional protein which catalyzes the first three steps of de novo uridine biosynthesis. Rodent cells resistant to PALA, a specific inhibitor of the ATCase activity of CAD, overproduce the CAD protein and CAD mRNA as a direct result of the amplification of the CAD gene. In order to study the mechanism of CAD gene amplification, a functional Syrian hamster CAD gene was inserted into a cosmid vector using molecular cloning techniques. The cloned genes were assayed for biological function by fusing CAD-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants with protoplasts of E. coli containing the CAD cosmids. Two clones with functional CAD genes were isolated and shown to contain inserts 40 and 45 kb long. The cloned genes could also be introduced into wild type CHO cells by selecting for cells which became resistant to high PALA concentrations in a single step. Transformations of mutant and wild type CHO cells contained multiple active copies of the donated Syrian hamster CAD genes in addition to their endogenous CHO CAD genes. The cloned genes in all transformants analyzed are integrated into host cell chromosomes at single locations defined by in situ hybridization. Independently isolated transformants contain the donated genes in different chromosomes. Co-transformation of CHO cells with two different genes by protoplast fusion is also shown to be possible.
ADA and PNP levels were measured in T-enriched and T-depleted subpopulations of peripheral mononuclear cells from patients with typhoid fever. ADA activity was significantly increased in T-enriched, but normal in T-depleted preparations of typhoid patients. Elevated levels of ADA in T cells were observed from the initial phase up to 30 days from the onset of the disease. Unlike ADA changes, PNP modifications were transitory, and affected both T-enriched and T-depleted subpopulations. The usefulness of ADA determination in T cells to detect and follow up T-cell activation during typhoid fever is suggested.
ABO frequencies are reported in a series of 341 patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR) for primary (idiopathic) osteoarthrosis. Diagnosis of primary osteoarthrosis was made on the basis of clinical history, radiography, and histology of the excised femoral head. Compared to a control group of blood donors from the same geographical area there is a significant deficit of group O among the arthritic patients. It is suggested that there may be a heritable component in the susceptibility to develop osteoarthrosis in an otherwise normal hip-joint.
CAT activity was decreased in the frontal cortex and the substantia innominata of parkinsonian subjects, post-mortem. The decrease was greater in the frontal cortex of parkinsonians with dementia. The density of muscarinic cholinergic receptors increased in the cortex. This increase was inversely correlated with tremor. The effects on these parameters of both neuronal degeneration and anticholinergic therapy are discussed.
ALAD activity is decreased by lead as well as by the aging of red cells. Experiments were performed to clarify the factors decreasing ALAD activity by the aging of red blood cells in rabbits. Measurements were conducted on ALAD activity and lead contents in young and old cells. Lead content in both young and old RBC groups ranged from 32 to 68 and 61 to 115 ng/10(10) RBC respectively. The old cells had a higher range of lead (21 to 50 ng) than the young cells. The result revealed that the increased lead content was not the main cause of decreased ALAD activity. Fully activated ALAD activity in both groups was measured by adding zinc ion (0.25 mM) and dithiothreitol (10 mM). The activity ratio of young to old cells was 1 to 0.6, suggesting that the decrease in enzyme depended on aging. The fully activated ALAD activity and oxidation of this enzyme were compared among erythroblasts, young and old cells. The ALAD activity decreased by 5-19.6% in young red cells and by 37-67% in old ones against that of erythroblasts. Treatment of the enzyme with dithiothreitol increased the activity by 12.6-19.4% in young red cells and by 24.2-27.3% in old ones. No increase in the enzyme activity in erythroblasts with dithiothreitol treatment was observed. These results suggest that the decreased activity of ALAD by aging is due mainly to the decrease of enzyme amount, partly to the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups of this enzyme, and only slightly to the increase in the blood lead.
ABO blood types of patients with positive blood cultures were compared with those of patients with negative blood cultures and blood bank work-ups. The proportion of blood types in patients with positive blood cultures and blood bank work-ups was very similar. However the proportion of patients with negative blood cultures, though statistically insignificant, appeared to be different. Also, proportions of blood types of patients having Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia suggest that patients with type A blood may be slightly more prone to S. aureus bacteremia than those of other types. Results show that there is no apparent statistically significant correlation between blood group type and the occurrence of bacteremia in the small population studied; however, a more exhaustive study might find otherwise.
STS 557 was tested for adverse effects in mice by prenatal and postnatal investigations. Several doses of STS 557 and levonorgestrel as a standard were administered on days 3--7, 8--12, or 13--17 post coitum. Following administration on days 3--7 p.c. an increase of skeleton retardations and skeleton alterations was found.
SDS electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels of purified trypsinogen 1 has shown the occurrence of a proteolysis in some molecules during long storage at -20 degrees C. This proteolyzed trypsinogen gives a positive reaction with an antiserum directed against the precipitate protein, major protein of about 14 000 molecular weight extracted from precipitates present in the pancreatic juice of patients with chronic pancreatitis. The autoactivation of proteolyzed trypsinogen 1 liberates a polypeptide of 14 000 molecular weight which is immunologically identical to the precipitate protein. These results show that the major protein present in pancreatic precipitates (and pancreatic stones) of patients with chronic pancreatitis is a degradation product of trypsinogen 1 liberated by a proteolysis which necessarily requires a premature zymogen activation in the disease.
SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of male and female hamster Harderian gland homogenates has shown a clear-cut sexual dimorphism. At least three major proteins present in the male gland are missing from the female gland. Two of the above are associated with the tubular clusters of the male gland while the third seems to be a structural component.
CYC1 and sup4 are part of a tightly linked cluster of genes on chromosome X in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using as probes previously cloned fragments containing the CYC1 and sup4 genes, we have identified and cloned the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) present between these genes in one strain of yeast. We find that the CYC1 and sup4 genes are approximately 21 kilobases apart. In the same strain, the meiotic map distance is approximately 3.7 centimorgans, for a ratio of 5.6 kilobases per centimorgan in this interval. The physical mapping has allowed unambiguous determination of the orientation of CYC1 and sup4 relative to each other, the centromere, and a nearby transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA(2Ser)) gene. The spontaneous mutation cyc1-1 inactivates the CYC1 gene as well as the neighboring loci OSM1 and RAD7. We have determined that a cyc1-1-bearing strain lacks approximately 13 kilobases of single-copy DNA from the CYC1-sup4 region, including all of the CYC1 coding information. There is a sequence homologous to the middle-repetitive element Ty1 at or near the breakpoint of the cyc1-1 deletion. We discuss the possibility that Ty elements play a role in the formation of such large, spontaneous deletions, which occur frequently in this region of chromosome X in certain yeast strains.
"ABO blood groups, subgroups, M, N and Rh blood types were studied among Bhoksas of Dehra Dun district in Uttar Pradesh. Bhoksas are characterized by high A (33.33%), MN (58.16%), Rz (8.85%), R"" (7.86%) and moderately low R1 (43.77%). The present sample does not show differences from the Bhoksas of Nainital but remains differentiated from Majumdar's sample so far as ABO blood groups are concerned. The present Bhoksas also remain undifferentiated from many Mongoloid and other populations of Eastern and Western Himalayas with respect to certain Rh chromosome frequencies. On the whole it is difficult to subscribe to, or reject, Bhoksas' claim of Rajput ancestry. Their differences with Indian Mongoloid populations namely, Bhotias and Tharus suggest that they might not belong to Mongoloid stock."
ADA of human serum was demonstrated and investigated with an agar gel diffusion technique using amyloid-impregnated agar plates. Sera of 20 healthy adults, 40 patients with AA-amyloidosis, and 86 nonamyloidotic patients were tested. The presence of an ADF, showing enzymatic properties and strongly bound to albumin, was demonstrated in normals and amyloidotic and nonamyloidotic patients. ADA in the serum of amyloidotic and cirrhotic patients was markedly decreased due to the presence of an inhibitor of ADF. ADA of amyloidotic sera was restored to normal by EDTA, citric acid, and ascorbic acid. The ADA of 16 FMF patients and four of 34 patients with rheumatoid arthritis without amyloidosis was intermediate between normal and amyloidotic values, indicating the presence of lADF at low concentrations in these patients. These findings suggest that amyloid is a normal protein metabolite, possibly with a high metabolic turnover. Accumulation of amyloid may be caused by decrease of the ADA of the serum by its inhibitor, rather than by accelerated production.
ABO blood group and secretor state was determined in 319 women with recurrent urinary tract infection and compared with those of a control group of 334 women of similar age ranges. Women of blood groups B and AB who are non-secretors of blood group substances showed a significant relative risk of recurrent urinary tract infection of 3.12 (95% confidence limits, 1.49 and 6.52) in comparison with other types. This appears to be a genuine example of synergy in which absence of anti-B isohaemagglutinin and secretor substances combines to give an increased risk of recurrent urinary tract infection. Determination of blood group and secretor state may provide additional information in identifying those at risk.
STS 557 (17 alpha-cyanomethyl-17 beta-hydroxy-estra-4,9(10)-diene-3-one) or levonorgestrel was given orally as a single dose of 0.4 mg per animal. Treatment was performed immediately after the 6 h mating period. In 30 control cycles (18 animals) 9 pregnancies (30%) and in 26 cycles (17 animals) with levonorgestrel treatment 3 pregnancies (11.5%) were observed. In 46 cycles (21 animals) with STS 557 treatment only one pregnancy (2.2%) occurred (chi 2-test: P less than 0.01 as compared to control cycles). Therefore, STS 557 showed high interceptive activities in this nonhuman primate model. In contrast with levonorgestrel, STS 557 did not decrease the postovulatory rise of plasma progesterone.
"ADA supports the Gersin-designed Simplified Numerical/ Graphical and Numerical/Numerical label formats, with sodium content listed separately at the bottom, printed in large type for easy reading by older Americans. ADA suggests adding teaching sessions as another setting in which to measure effectiveness, and including nutrition educators and their students in the sample composition. ADA expects that eliminating the information ""servings per container"" will result in consumer confusion, and recommends an interview question to test this. The independent variables relating to quantity of useful information should be controlled for type and placement of desirable information on the label. Nutrition education is a vital part of providing useful nutrition information and should be highlighted in the implementation plan. We look forward to an ongoing exchange of ideas on this matter."
CA1 and CA3 neurones in transverse slices of guinea-pig hippocampus were voltage clamped through a single micro-electrode, and perfused with Krebs solution containing 0.5 microM-tetrodotoxin and 10 mM-tetraethylammonium at (normally) 24-26 degrees C. Slow inward currents of less than or equal to 0.5 nA were recorded during depolarizing voltage commands to membrane potentials positive to between -40 and -30 mV. These currents peaked at 100-300 msec after the onset of the depolarizing command, then subsequently declined during continuing depolarization. This decline could be ascribed to a developing outward current since repolarizing inward current tails showed no diminution up to 700 msec. No clear evidence for time-dependent inactivation of the inward current could be obtained. A persistent component of inward current could be detected when the membrane potential was maintained above the inward current threshold, such that small hyperpolarizing commands induced an outward relaxation and large hyperpolarizations produced an inward tail current. The inward current was depressed by removing external Ca, or by adding 0.2-0.5 mM-Cd, or 0.1 mM-verapamil, and was increased by adding 1 mM-Ba. A possible role for this persistent inward current in generating the slow membrane depolarization underlying burst discharges in these neurones is discussed. In some neurones (primarily CA1), an additional fast spike-like current was recorded, which was blocked by Cd or Mn and depressed by a depolarizing pre-pulse. It is suggested that this was a manifestation of the previously-reported dendritic Ca spike.
CAT has been performed in 100 alcoholism and 41 controls. Comparisons between the two groups are made, the clinico-psychological correlates of the morphological abnormalities discussed, and the preliminary findings on 23 patients followed up one year later are reported.
DBH is a copper-containing oxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of the beta carbon of a wide variety of phenylethylamine derivatives using molecular oxygen ascorbate as cofactors. It is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 290,000 and consists of four identical subunits, each with a single copper atom and 5% carbohydrate by weight. The enzyme is a constituent of catecholamine storage vesicles in chromaffin cell and adrenergic neurons in the peripheral and central nervous system where it functions to synthesize noradrenaline from dopamine. Although endogenous inhibitors have been isolated, they have not been demonstrated to have a physiological function, and the kinetics of the enzyme in vitro and in vivo suggest that the enzyme is not a rate limiting step in catecholamine synthesis under normal conditions. DBH exists in both a soluble form within vesicles and as a constituent of their membranes with its active site directed inward. The significance of the partition of the enzyme into soluble and membrane forms is not understood, although the soluble form has a fivefold greater homospecific activity. DBH has been one of the most intensively investigated enzymes in neurochemistry for several reasons. It is a readily assayable constitutent of catecholamine storage vesicles and, as such, provides a convenient biochemical marker for subcellular fractionation work and studies of the cellular regulation of catecholamine synthesis, storage, and release. The adrenal medulla is a rich source of the enzyme for purification, and the purified enzyme is highly antigenic, thereby enabling the use of several immunological techniques to study the cellular dynamics of the enzyme and the organelles in which it is located. These include radioimmunoassay, immunohistochemistry, and cytochemistry. This review firstly summarizes the present state of knowledge concerning the molecular properties of DBH. It then describes the tissue, cellular, and subcellular localization of the enzyme and its physiological regulation. The remainder of the review concentrates on those aspects of research on DBH in which the authors have participated that have led to general advances such as the development of the concept of homospecific activity, the introduction of immunohistochemistry for the localization of enzymes involved in transmitter metabolism, the release of macromolecules from synaptic vesicles during the process of exocytosis, the use of antibodies to DBH administered in vivo to study the fate of synaptic vesicle membranes and to produce specific immunological lesions of noradrenergic nerves in the peripheral and central nervous system, the genetic, environmental, and physiological determinants of serum DBH activity as an index of sympathetic function in animals and man, and the question of its diagnostic value in disease.
ABO incompatible allogeneic bone marrow transplants can be performed successfully to treat patients with leukemia or aplastic anemia. These transplants carry no great risk of rejection or graft-versus-host disease, however, some method must be used to avoid acute hemolysis at the time of infusion of ABO incompatible marrow. We have used successfully large volume plasma exchange to remove anti-A or anti-B antibodies prior to marrow infusion. More recently we have used immunoadsorbent columns containing synthetic A or B antigen specifically to remove anti-A or anti-B antibodies in lieu of plasma exchange. These columns are better tolerated than plasma exchange where allergic reactions are common.
ABO blood group compatibility is generally required for successful human kidney transplants and new data suggest donor-recipient incompatibility for the Lewis or multiple minor blood groups is detrimental. This is of special importance in the setting of liberal transfusions prior to transplant. To assess the impact of immunizing exposure to disparate blood groups of ABO-matched transfusions and kidney transplants, we studied the interrelationships of anti-erythrocyte antibodies, leukocytotoxins and graft survival in 42 kidney transplant recipients. Three hundred forty-four sera were screened for anti-erythrocyte antibodies using standard hemagglutination techniques and leukocytotoxins, using the antiglobulin method. Statistical analysis by computer used a 2 x 2 x 2 contingency table with model fitting. Only 13 of 42 patients had anti-erythrocyte antibodies at some time: anti-I (4); anti-Kell (1); cold panagglutinin (7); unidentifiable agglutinin (1). Of 42 patients, 16 had no detectable leukocytotoxins. By computer analysis, immunizations to blood group and HLA antigens were independent phenomena. Analysis showed that leukocytotoxins, but not anti-erythrocyte antibodies, were associated with poor graft survival. A computer generated probability of graft survival by antibody status is presented. We conclude that immunization to blood group antigens is not common, is largely non-specific, and is not detrimental to kidney graft survival.
ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn is a common and potentially severe disease. It can cause hyperbilirubinemia and anemia in the infant. A review of 230 primigravid mothers of affected offspring is presented. Evaluation of their subsequent pregnancies showed a recurrence rate of 88% in those infants at risk for the disease (of same blood type as their index sibling), with 62% of the affected infants requiring therapy. Guidelines for antenatal counseling are presented.
LCAT esterifies cholesterol to cholesterol ester. This study describes a family with plasma LCAT deficiency with a heterozygous variant. It was found that both parents and one son had half the normal plasma LCAT activity whereas their only daughter and other son exhibited zero plasma LCAT activity, suggesting an autosomal co-dominant inheritance of the enzyme deficiency. Erythrocyte membrane abnormalities (e.g., increased erythrocyte PC and cholesterol) that were associated with patients with zero plasma LCAT were also observed in family members with half the LCAT. Additionally, erythrocytes from LCAT-deficient individuals were more susceptible to peroxidant threat and had membranes that were more mechanically unstable than those from individuals with normal plasma LCAT activity.
STS 557, a new orally active progestin with antifertility properties has been tested for uterotrophic, antiuterotrophic, vaginotrophic, and antiovulatory effects. Further, maintenance of pregnancy in ovariectomized mice, influence on pregnancy in mice and rats, and conditioning of the immature rat uterus for decidual response were investigated. Both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activities in mice and rats were found to be very low. STS 557 fails to maintain pregnancy in ovariectomized animals but does not interfere with pregnancy in intact mice if implantation already took place. Moreover, no effects have been found regarding the influence on the first ovulation in prepuberal rats. The biological profile of STS 557 in animals seems to make this compound suitable for use as a post-coital contraceptive.
ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn is the single most common cause of neonatal jaundice, with an incidence of 54.4 per 1,000 births; it occurs almost exclusively in infants of groups A or B having mothers of group O. Previous studies have shown a poor correlation between serologic tests on cord blood and clinical course in affected infants. In a retrospective analysis of 254 cases of ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn the relation of laboratory parameters to incidence and severity of jaundice was studied. Sixty-five per cent of the infants who had positive direct antiglobulin tests experienced jaundice, compared with approximately 35% of control infants or infants who had ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn with negative direct antiglobulin test results. Infants who had ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn with positive direct antiglobulin test results also had greater severity of jaundice than control infants or infants who had ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn with negative direct antiglobulin test results (P less than .0001). Thus, the direct antiglobulin test is a good screening test for ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn. Sex, race, gravidity, birth weight, and blood type of the infant did not have significant relationships to clinical outcome. The combined results of the direct antiglobulin test and the strength of reaction in a heat eluate may be of use in prognosis; although differences were not significant, infants who had stronger eluates had higher bilirubin values and were more likely to require therapy. Serologic analysis of cord blood can be useful in the early detection of infants having the risk of severe jaundice.
CAT scanning was used in the localization of intraocular and periorbital foreign bodies in 36 consecutive patients. The method was found to be convenient, well-tolerated by the patient, and provided accurate and useful clinical information. Six cases are described to illustrate clinical situations where traditional localizing methods were unable to supply satisfactory information and where CAT scanning proved to be of significant assistance. This included uncooperative patients, multiple foreign bodies, anterior foreign bodies, and foreign bodies adjacent to the posterior scleral wall.
GPT polymorphism was studied in 500 voluntary blood donors from the Bologna population. The following phenotype frequencies were obtained: GPT 1 = 29.60%, GPT 1-2 = 49.80% and GPT 2 = 20.60%. The frequencies of the alleles were: GPT1 - 0.545 and GPT2 = 0.455. Analysis of 24 informative families has excluded linkage between GPT and beta-thalassaemia.
STS 557 (17 alpha-cyanomethyl-17 beta-hydroxy-estra-4.9(10)-diene-3-one) is a potent progestin. This compound was 10 times as potent as the standard levonorgestrel as judged by the classic Clauberg-McPhail Assay. The antiprogestational response is significant when STS 557 treatment starts 2 days before progesterone administration. It does not disturb the priming activity of estradiol. This compound alone is adequate for endometrial priming. Early pregnancy is maintained in ovariectomized does. Administration on day 1 of pregnancy reduces the number of implantations. In comparison with chlormadinone acetate and d-norgestrel, only STS 557 treatment causes complete inhibition of egg fertilization.
SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to study the proteins extracted from, and those remaining in isolated, fixed, air-dried nuclei subjected to a variety of R- and C-banding techniques. The R-banding procedures, involving exposure to hot Earle's BSS or NaH2PO4, had the least effect of any of the banding techniques on the extraction of proteins from isolated nuclei. Only small amounts of 5 nonhistone proteins were detected in the Earle's BSS extract, and no proteins were found in the NaH2PO4 solution after treatment. The residual proteins remaining in the nuclei after either treatment were virtually identical to those in control nuclei. The C-banding techniques, on the other hand, produced substantial changes in the nuclear proteins. These techniques involve several sequential steps, including HCl treatment, exposure to NaOH or Ba(OH)2, and an incubation in hot SSC. The HCl treatment extracted a large variety of nonhistones and some of each of the remaining histones. No proteins were detected in the SSC solution. Some of the proteins extracted by Ba(OH)2 appeared after the two complete C-banding treatments revealed both similarities and differences. The Ba(OH)2 technique appeared to have a more severe effect on the nuclear proteins than the NaOH technique. Fewer residual nuclear proteins were observed after the former technique, but all of these were also represented in nuclei after the NaOH technique. The results indicate that the different treatments producing a common type of banding generally have similar effects on the nuclear proteins, while the treatments producing different types of banding (G-, R-, C-banding) have substantially different effects on these proteins. Such alterations may have implications for chromosome banding.
"COMT enzyme characteristics (Km, V, ratio of meta/paramethylation) were determined in the red blood cells of 20 patients with endogenous depression, in 20 healthy controls matched as to age and sex, as well as in 10 patients with mania, and 10 patients with neurotic depression. Assessment was done twice, i.e. before and after remission in patients with endogenous depression and in the manic patients. If male and female patients are considered together there was no statistical difference between the COMT characteristics of these patient groups, either before or after remission. Only the bipolar patients showed a higher COMT-activity (V) than their individually matched controls. If however, only the female patients are taken into consideration, COMT-activity of the patients with endogenous depression vs. controls is significantly increased by 60%. This difference can be demonstrated also after remission (""free interval"") though statistical significance is reached only for the unipolar group. Further in vitro experiments indicate that antidepressant drugs do not possess a relevant influence on COMT-activity. Ranking the mean COMT-values leads to the following order: matched controls (< neurotic depression < unipolar depression < bipolar depression, which would be in good agreement with theoretical expectations based on the amine hypothesis of depression. Compared with normal male subjects COMT-activity of female controls is significantly lower. On the other hand, the female patients with endogenous depression show a significantly higher enzyme activity than the corresponding male patients."
APRT deficiency may be totally benign or life threatening. The importance of early recognition/diagnosis is thus stressed. Urolithiasis (2,8-DHA stones: the precipitating factor in all cases) is treatable. With early recognition and treatment allopurinol without alkali and a diet low in purine homozygotes have remained clinically and biochemically normal to date. 'Uric acid' stones in children must always be suspect and subjected to sophisticated analysis. Diagnosis from red cell APRT activity may also have its pitfalls.
ADA deficiency manifests as a severe combined immunodeficiency with profound T-lymphocytopenia. Affected individuals have variable defects of both T- and B-lymphocyte function and greatly increased morbidity and mortality caused by frequent viral and bacterial infection. In 1990 a clinical protocol for the treatment of this disease using retrovirus mediated transfer of the ADA gene into peripheral lymphocytes was begun and in 1993 an amendment permitting gene transfer to CD34+ stem cells isolated from peripheral blood or from umbilical cord blood was approved. Five patients have been treated on this protocol and have been analyzed for the persistence of cells containing the transferred gene and for immunologic reconstitution.
CD38 is a leukocyte differentiation antigen that has been thought to be a phenotypic marker of different subpopulations of T- and B-lymphocytes. In myeloid cells, CD38 is expressed during early stages of differentiation. Virtually no information is available on regulation and functions of CD38. Recently we reported that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is a potent and highly specific inducer of CD38 expression in human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Here we report that ATRA-induced expression of CD38 antigen in myeloid cells is mediated through retinoic acid-alpha receptor (RAR alpha). ATRA failed to induce CD38 expression in a mutant subclone of the HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line (designated HL-60R) that is relatively resistant to ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation. Retroviral vector-mediated transduction of RA receptor (RAR alpha) into this HL-60R subclone completely restored the sensitivity of these cells to ATRA in terms of their ability to express CD38. In contrast, CD38 expression was not inducible by ATRA in HL-60R cells, transfected with a functional RAR beta, RAR gamma, or RXR alpha receptor. Induction of CD38 in acute promyelocytic and acute myeloblastic leukemia cells was independent of ATRA-induced cytodifferentiation. Following culture with ATRA, increased CD38 protein levels were also observed in normal CD34+ bone marrow cells, but not on normal circulating granulocytes. From these results, we conclude that CD38 is ATRA inducible in myeloid leukemia cells and normal CD34+ bone marrow cells. This effect is independent of differentiation and is mediated by RAR alpha in HL-60 cells, suggesting a similar role for RAR alpha in CD38 expression in other hematopoietic cells.
CD36 is a glycoprotein that is expressed on platelets, monocytes, and endothelial cells. To analyze the mechanism of CD36 deficiency on the platelet membrane, we have examined the expression of mRNA by RT-PCR and the Sau96I site on PCR products. In cases 3, 5, and 6, we have detected the normal size, but few products by agarose gel electrophoresis and in all cases, several restriction enzyme patterns with Sau96I digestion have been observed. These findings suggest that transcriptional control may affect the expression of the CD36 molecule on the platelet membrane and a different mechanism may be present for the transcription of the CD36 mRNA in megakaryocytes from monocytes.
CFTR belongs to a group of proteins sharing the structural motif of six transmembrane helices and a nucleotide binding domain. Unique to CFTR is the R domain, a charged cytoplasmic domain. Comparison of R domain sequences from ten species revealed that the N-terminal third is highly conserved, while the C-terminal two-thirds is poorly conserved. The R domain shows no strong sequence similarity to known proteins; however, 14 viral pol proteins show limited similarity to fragments of the R domain. Analysis revealed a relationship between the N- and C-terminal fragments of the R domain and two discontinuous fragments of the pol protein. These observations support a two-domain model for the R domain.
CD36 has been implicated in several intracellular signalling events, including platelet and monocyte activation, and receptor-mediated internalization of bound ligands such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein and apoptotic neutrophils. These processes are presumably mediated by the intracytoplasmic domain(s) of the molecule. By analysis of hydrophobicity plots and by analogy to rat LIMPII, which has a 60% homology to CD36, a two-transmembrane domain model has been proposed. To characterize the structure-function relationships of CD36 involved in transducing the signal, we have defined the number of transmembrane and intracellular domains experimentally using a mutagenesis approach. A truncated CD36 cDNA was constructed that encodes a protein that terminates just proximal to the putative C-terminal transmembrane domain. This mutant was cloned into eukaryotic expression plasmid vectors to generate short-term and stable transfected cells. Our results indicate that the truncated mutant is secreted by the transfectants into the postculture medium, indicating that there is only one transmembrane domain in CD36, which is present at the C-terminal end. The soluble secreted protein from all of these cells is functional as indicated by its binding to thrombospondin.
ME1 is a monoclonal antibody which is generated by the use of a mesothelioma cell line (SPCIII). The antibody has a preferential reaction to antigens on mesothelial and mesothelioma cells. In a prospective study we determined the reactivity in frozen sections from malignant mesotheliomas (two cases, positive controls), lung tumours (115 cases) and other malignant tumours (23 cases). The two malignant mesotheliomas were immunoreactive in most of the tumour cells. The reaction was strong, often with a diffuse staining of the cytoplasm and in some tumour cells there was heavy staining of the cell membrane. Five adenocarcinomas of the lung (9%), one large cell carcinoma (10%) and 18 squamous cell carcinomas of the lung (41%) were positive (defined as tumours containing more than 10% positive tumour cells with a strong reaction). The same was true for seven out of 23 (30%) extrapulmonary malignancies. The overall nosologic specificity of ME1 was 76%. Twenty out of the 26 ME1-positive lung tumours and six out of seven ME1-positive extrapulmonary malignancies were also positive for one or more markers, which is considered characteristic of carcinomas. The six negative lung tumours were squamous cells carcinomas and the negative extrapulmonary tumour was a meningeoma; all of them with a morphology different to malignant mesothelioma. In conclusion, when frozen sections are available, ME1 might be useful in the differential diagnosis of malignant tumours. However, a positive reaction is not specific for malignant mesothelioma.
CD36 is a multifunctional cell surface glycoprotein that acts as a surface receptor for thrombospondin (TSP), and thereby may mediate adhesive interactions between cells and substrata, platelets and other cells, and macrophages and apoptotic neutrophils. The identity of the TSP binding site on CD36 is controversial and may involve more than one structural domain. We have constructed a series of recombinant bacterial GST/CD36 fusion proteins that span nearly all of the CD36 molecule and have demonstrated that fusion proteins containing the region extending from amino acid 93 to 120 formed specific, saturable, and reversible complexes with TSP. As with intact CD36, binding was calcium-dependent, was independent of which ligand was immobilized, and was blocked by monoclonal antibodies to both CD36 and TSP. Stoichiometry and affinity of the fusion proteins for TSP were consistent with that of the intact protein. We also demonstrated that these fusion proteins competitively inhibited binding of TSP to purified platelet CD36 and to cell surface CD36 on peripheral blood monocytes and CD36 cDNA-transfected melanoma cells. These data demonstrate that the region between amino acids 93 and 120 has all of the characteristics required of the TSP binding domain.
CD36 deficiency is divided into two subgroups: neither platelets nor monocytes express CD36 (type I deficiency), and monocytes express CD36 in spite of the lack of platelet CD36 (type II deficiency). We have already demonstrated that a 478C-->T substitution (proline90-->serine) in platelet CD36 cDNA predominates in type II deficiency (Kashiwagi, H., S. Honda, Y. Tomiyama, H. Mizutani, H. Take, Y. Honda, S. Kosugi, Y. Kanayama, Y. Kurata, and Y. Matsuzawa. 1993. Thromb. Haemostasis. 69:481-484). In this study, we revealed that monocyte CD36 cDNA from two type II deficient subjects was heterozygous for C478 and T478 form, while platelet CD36 cDNA of these subjects consisted of only T478 form. In a type I deficient subject, both platelet and monocyte CD36 cDNA showed only T478 form. Expression assay using C478 or T478 form of CD36 cDNA transfected cells revealed that there was an 81-kD precursor form of CD36, and that the maturation of the 81-kD precursor form to the 88-kD mature form of CD36 was markedly impaired by the substitution. The mutated precursor form of CD36 was subsequently degraded in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that the 478C-->T substitution directly leads to CD36 deficiency via defects in posttranslational modification, and that this substitution is the major defects underlying CD36 deficiency.
CA6 antibody was selected out of a monoclonal antibody library raised against human sperm proteins primarily for its ability to recognize an epididymal antigen and to modify sperm adhesion to zona-free hamster oocytes. In the present study, CA6 was shown to decrease sperm binding to zona-free hamster and human oocytes by 40-92% and 38-48%, respectively. The corresponding protein, which was referred to as FLB1, was found to be secreted by the epididymis and to bind specifically to a human, macaque, and rodent subacrosomal sperm region. Western blotting revealed a molecular mass of 94 kDa in human epididymal extracts and of 100 kDa in human, macaque, mouse, rat, and hamster sperm, suggesting further modifications after its binding to sperm. An equivalent protein was not observed in human liver, ovary, testis, plasma, or epidermis. Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed that FLB1 is formed of two subunits with the same 47-kDa molecular mass and slightly different pI (5.8, 5.9). Microsequencing of the protein revealed a partial homology with human cytokeratins 1 and 10. These results suggest that FLB1 is an epididymis-specific cytokeratin-like protein that is involved in the sperm-oocyte recognition process.
CFTR is a member of the traffic ATPase superfamily and a Cl- ion channel that appears to require ATP hydrolysis for gating. Analysis of single CFTR Cl- channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers revealed the presence of two open conductance states that are connected to each other and to the closed state by an asymmetric cycle of gating events. We show here that the transition between the two open conductance states is directly coupled to ATP hydrolysis by one of the consensus nucleotide-binding folds, designated NBF2. Moreover, the transition between the closed state and one of the open states is linked to the binding of ATP. This analysis permits real-time visualization of conformational changes associated with a single cycle of ATP hydrolysis by a single protein molecule and suggests a model describing a role for ATP in CFTR gating.
TPO autoantibodies, the hallmark of human autoimmune thyroid disease, are of IgG class and are associated with thyroid destruction and hypothyroidism. Using the immunoglobulin gene combinatorial library approach, a panel of human monoclonal TPO autoantibodies (expressed as Fab) has been generated from thyroid tissue-infiltrating B cells. TPO-specific Fab closely resemble patients' serum autoantibodies in terms of L chain type, IgG subclass, affinities for TPO as well as epitopes recognized by > 80% of TPO autoantibodies in an individual's serum. TPO autoantibody V region genes are not unique; H chain V genes are usually mutated, while L chain V genes are sometimes in germ-line conformation. The autoantibodies recognize an immunodominant region involving conformational, overlapping epitopes in domains A and B. Finally, TPO autoantibody epitopic fingerprints are distinctive for individual sera, are not associated with hypothyroidism, but are conserved over time (indicating a lack of B cell epitope spreading). Evidence for conservation as well as inheritance of the fingerprints in some families, together with VH gene polymorphisms, may provide insight into the genetic basis of human autoimmune thyroid disease. Furthermore, monoclonal human TPO autoantibodies will be invaluable for B cell presentation of TPO to determine the T cell epitopes involved in TPO autoantibody production.
TPO is a recently cloned cytokine which appears to play a central role in megakaryopoiesis and platelet production. It has been shown to be the ligand for c-mpl, a member of the hematopoietic receptor superfamily. We examined intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation events induced by TPO and compared them with events stimulated by IL-3, a pleiotropic cytokine which also has activity on the megakaryocyte lineage. The overall pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by TPO and IL-3 in myeloid precursor cells revealed an overlapping but not identical pattern reflecting their distinct but partially redundant biological effects. We identify Shc and Vav as intracellular targets of TPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the tyrosine kinase Jak2 is phosphorylated after TPO stimulation. Whereas phosphorylation of these proteins was induced by both cytokines, phosphorylation of Jak1 was induced only by IL-3 and not by TPO, distinguishing the signal transduction of the two cytokines on a molecular level.
ACE inhibitors are superior to other vasodilators in the treatment of congestive heart failure and may be advantageous in patients with myocardial infarction and hypertension. The mechanisms mediating these beneficial effects are not clear. The present article discusses the mechanisms leading to augmented release of endothelium-derived nitric oxide during ACE inhibition. Acute potentiation of bradykinin (Bk)-induced vasodilation was studied in rings of bovine and human coronary arteries mounted in organ chambers for recording of isometric force. The ACE inhibitors captopril, enalaprilat, fosinoprilat, lisinopril, or ramiprilat alone did not affect vascular tone in isolated coronary tone in isolated coronary artery preparations with intact endothelium. However, in the presence of exogenous Bk, kallidin, or one of the slowly degradable Bk2-receptor agonists D-Arg(Hyp3)-Bk or [Hyp3-Tyr(Me)8]-Bk they elicited potent concentration-dependent relaxations. Relaxations in response to lisinopril were not observed in the presence of other vasodilators. They were prevented by mechanical removal of the endothelium, inhibition of nitric oxide synthase or Bk2-receptor blockade. The data indicate that ACE inhibitors potentiate the effects of Bk on endothelial cells by a local mechanism, probably independent of the degradation of bradykinin. The chronic effects of ACE inhibitors on endothelial function were compared with those of selective angiotensin(AT)1-receptor blockade in cyclosporin A (CsA) treated rats. Chronic AT blockade alone does not affect endothelium-dependent relaxation and increases contractions to ATII in the rot aorta. Combination of CsA with either an ACE-Inhibitor or an AT2 receptor antagonist prevented the endothelial dysfunction in the rat arta observed after CsA alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
"CA3 pyramidal neurons were stained with biocytin during intracellular recording in rat hippocampus in vivo and reconstructed using a computer-based system. The in vivo CA3 neurons were characterized primarily according to their proximity to the hilus and secondarily with respect to the septotemporal location. Neurons measured in CA3a (n = 4), in CA3b (n = 4), and in posterior/ventral locations (n = 3) had the greatest dendritic lengths (19.8, 19.1, and 26.8 mm on average, respectively). Cells closer to the hilus showed much shorter dendritic lengths, averaging 10.4 mm for CA3c neurons (n = 4) and 11.6 mm for zone 3 neurons (n = 2). Half of the cells showed more than one major apical dendrite, and dendritic trees were highly variable even within CA3 subregions. The mean electronic length for these cell groups averaged between 0.30 lambda (CA3c) and 0.45 lambda (posterior/ventral), assuming a constant specific-membrane resistivity of 60 K omega-cm2. These CA3 neurons form a database of reconstructed neurons for further morphometric and electrical modelling studies. The large degree of variability between individual CA3 neurons indicates that both dendritic and electrical properties should be specifically calculated for each cell rather than assuming a ""typical"" morphology."
CP 55,940 is a potent synthetic bicyclic cannabinoid analog that has been used in a number of studies as a radioligand for the cannabinoid receptor. This compound shares behavioral and biochemical properties with naturally occurring cannabinoids such as delta 9-THC. The purpose of the present study was 3-fold: to establish the ability of CP 55,940 to serve as a discriminative stimulus, to determine whether this discriminative stimulus is identical to that of delta 9-THC, and to examine whether a newly developed cannabinoid antagonist, SR141716A, would antagonize the discriminative stimulus effects of CP 55,940. Rats were trained to discriminate 0.1 mg/kg CP 55,940 from vehicle in standard 2-lever operant conditioning chambers. CP 55,940 produced dose-dependent generalization from the training dose in dose-effect determinations conducted before and after testing with other drugs. The effects of the training dose of CP 55,940 were dose-dependently antagonized by co-administration of SR141716A. Results of substitution tests showed that delta 9-THC, WIN 55,212-2, and cannabinol substituted completely for CP 55,940 in a dose-dependent manner; however, CP 55,940 was approx 10-fold more potent than any of the other drugs in producing CP 55,940-like discriminative stimulus effects. Several drugs with CNS depressant properties (phencyclidine, haloperidol and diazepam) failed to produce reliable substitution for CP 55,940. These results demonstrate that CP 55,940 has discriminative stimulus effects and that it shares these effects with structurally dissimilar compounds that, like CP 55,940, bind to the cannabinoid receptor. Further, these effects are blocked by SR141716A, a cannabinoid receptor antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
ACE inhibitors improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in hypertensive patients with normal renal function. Hypertensive patients with renal failure are a high-risk group who are particularly glucose intolerant and insulin resistant. We have therefore studied whether ACE inhibition improve glucose tolerance in this group as well. In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study 10 patients with stable moderate chronic renal failure (mean endogenous creatinine clearance 40 +/- 16 ml/min/1.73 m2) were examined. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either placebo or the ACE inhibitor perindopril (2 mg/day per os) for 14 days. After 7 days of wash-out they received the alternative medications in random order for another 14 days. Before and after each of the two treatment periods (day 1 and day 15) an intravenous glucose tolerance test (i.v. GTT) with concomitant determination of insulin levels was performed. The glucose disappearance rate (K value) was calculated to express changes in glucose tolerance. An i.v. GTT was also performed in a group of healthy volunteers. The mean K value was significantly (P < 0.05) lower, i.e. glucose tolerance was impaired, in patients compared with healthy controls. In addition, baseline and peak insulin levels after the i.v. GTT were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in patients than in healthy subjects. The K values in patients before and after placebo treatment (1.33 +/- 0.31 and 1.41 +/- 0.45 respectively) were not significantly different from the values with perindopril treatment (1.35 +/- 0.37 and 1.41 +/- 0.48 respectively). Furthermore, no significant differences between placebo and perindopril treatment were found with respect to the insulin response to the glucose load. The peak (5 min) insulin concentrations after the i.v. glucose load were 49.0 +/- 19.2 microU/ml (day 1) and 50.0 +/- 24.9 (day 15) with placebo and 49.2 +/- 19.3 (day 1) and 46.8 +/- 17.9 (day 15) with perindopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
CD36 deficiency, which could lead to CD36 isoimmunization, has been reported in the Japanese population. CD36 isoantibody has been involved in platelet transfusion refractoriness.
CD38 is an ectoenzyme that utilizes NAD+ and is expressed by many cells of hematopoietic origin. Antibodies to CD38 potentiate many biological activities on lymphocytes, including induction of murine B-cell proliferation. In this article, Frances Lund and colleagues summarize information concerning the expression, enzymatic activity and signal transduction pathway utilized by murine CD38.
GSTM1 gene deficiency has been shown to occur in approximately half of the populations of various ethnic origins and has been implicated as a factor for elevated risk for lung cancers. However the results have been variable or even conflicting between the studies. In an attempt to explore the reason for such a diversity, we studied the distribution of GSTM1 genotypes in relation to gender, age and smoking status in 447 Japanese lung cancer patients and 469 community controls. We found: (1) that in squamous and small cell carcinomas GSTM1 null genotype distributed markedly more in females than males especially among the patients aged < 70 years (male 57.4%, female 100.0%); (2) that GSTM1 null genotype distributed generally more in patients aged < 70 years (58.3%) than those aged > or = 70 years (50.0%) irrespective of histologies except for small cell carcinoma; and (3) that proportion of GSTM1 null genotype increased dependent on the extent of tobacco smoke exposure in male patients having squamous and small cell carcinomas aged < 70 years, and remained high but independent of the smoking index in adenocarcinoma and unchanged in never- or exsmokers from the control level (48.6%). The present study thus suggests that composition of GSTM1 genotypes in patients is significantly affected by gender, age and smoking status, which should be taken into consideration in any attempt to determine the association of GSTM1 genotypes for risk assessment. With the diverse of GSTM1 null genotype variability between patients of different histologies, our results were also suggestive of different carcinogenic involvement of GSTM1 deficiency among different histological cell types.
ACE inhibitors exert both acute and chronic beneficial effects on cardiac function (eg, remodeling, diastolic dysfunction) in experimental studies and in patients. They inhibit the formation of angiotensin II as well as the degradation of endogenous bradykinin. We recently reported that bradykinin induces selective left ventricular (LV) relaxant effects in isolated hearts via the release of nitric oxide. The present study examined the direct effects of interaction between the ACE inhibitor captopril and endogenous bradykinin on cardiac contractile function.
CYP11B1 was detected in the human adrenal cortex and in human adenomas by in situ-hybridization methods. Specific riboprobes were generated and hybridized to sections of an Aldosterone Producing Adenoma (APA), the non-tumour portion of the corresponding adrenal gland and two adenomas not related to hyperaldosteronism. P45011B1 mRNA was clearly localized in the zona fasciculata/reticularis. Semi-quantitative analysis has been performed and seems to be applicable for a further classification of adrenal tumours. Stable expression of CYP11B1 cDNA was performed in V79 cells. The interference of different substances (metyrapone, spironolactone and different imidazole derivatives) with CYP11B1 activity was studied using this cell line. The cell line revealed to be suitable for analysis of the active site of CYP11B1 as well as for analysis of side effects of drugs on steroidogenesis.
ADA congratulates NCEP on 10 years of important contributions to reducing cardiovascular disease. Dietitians have played a major role in implementing dietary recommendations of the cholesterol education campaign through its members, programs, research projects, and publications. The partnership is strong and dynamic. Together, there is much to accomplish in the years ahead to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and improve the nutritional status of all Americans.
CAD is present in most patients with peripheral arterial disease and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality after vascular operations. Clinical risk assessment attempts to identify those patients at low, intermediate, or high cardiac risk for adverse cardiac outcomes. Additional tests add little information to the estimates obtained by clinical scoring in patients at low risk. Patients with high cardiac risk scores are clearly at increased risk of experiencing postoperative complications, but further investigations are needed only if knowledge of the functional severity or degree of myocardial ischemia will alter subsequent management. In general, high-risk patients should proceed to coronary angiography, intensive perioperative monitoring, alteration in the planned operation, or avoidance of surgery altogether if indications are less than compelling. Those patients identified as intermediate risk by clinical scoring benefit most from additional tests. In these patients special studies or even coronary arteriography may be useful if the vascular surgery can be delayed until myocardial revascularization is completed. Practically, preoperative cardiac work-up must also consider the indication for surgery. Patients who have threatened limbs or ruptured aneurysms or are severely symptomatic cannot afford the time involved for obtaining additional tests. Moreover, the question of what to do with the information provided by special studies is problematic in these patients. For example, if significant symptomatic or asymptomatic CAD is present in a patient with a gangrenous foot, what is gained by the delay in lower extremity revascularization required when prophylactic CABG is performed? Reports supporting prophylactic CAD intervention are nonrandomized and uncontrolled. CABG and PTCA should be performed only on the merits of the patient's cardiac symptoms and coronary artery anatomy, not to enhance safety of the proposed vascular procedure, because advances in surgical and anesthetic techniques and intraoperative and postoperative monitoring have resulted in lower morbidity and mortality of elective vascular surgery.
CYP3A7 is a form of cytochrome P450, which is expressed specifically in human fetal livers. NPVHF1, a recombinant baculovirus containing the entire coding region of CYP3A7, was constructed and infected to Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. Upon infection with NPVHF1, the Sf9 cells expressed the CYP3A7 to the maximum content of 0.2 nmol per mg of whole cell lysates 72 hours after infection. A 5.5-fold expression level (1.1 nmol per mg of whole cell lysates) was attainable when cultured in the presence of externally added hemin. A catalytic activity of the CYP3A7 expressed in the Sf9 cells was confirmed by the umu gene expression mutation assay, in which aflatoxin B1 was activated to a mutagen by the expressed CYP3A7 in the presence of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and cytochrome b5. From these results, it is concluded that the baculovirus expression system enables the high-level expression of CYP3A7 and will be a very useful tool for the characterization of CYP3A7.
CYP1A1 is a cytochrome P450 which is inducible by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). This induction is mediated via the Ahr locus which encodes the cytosolic Aryl hydrocarbon receptor. The induced activity of CYP1A1 can be measured in vitro by the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in lymphocytes after induction by benz(a)anthracene (B(a)A). Our purpose was to determine, using this assay, the genetic polymorphism of CYP1A1 induction. With this aim, a population and family study was undertaken. Using the statistical SKUMIX method, a bimodal distribution (two peaks) of the induced EROD activity among 102 unrelated individuals was obtained. We were unable to discriminate three classes of CYP1A1 induction phenotype since a trimodal distribution did not significantly improve the fit to the data (chi 2(1) = 0.37, p > 0.9). Segregation analysis performed on 57 nuclear families gave evidence of a major gene effect together with a polygenic component. The frequency of the high induction allele is equal to 0.11 with dominance on the low induction allele. This is an accordance with two distributions, with individuals showing low and high CYP1A1 induction phenotypes in proportions of 89% and 21% respectively. However, some degree of overlap between the two distributions prevented a clear genotype classification on the basis of the phenotype measured with the EROD assay. Further analyses should not be made with a dichotomized phenotype (low and high inducers) but should use quantitative measurements.
ACE inhibitors are used widely in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure, but there is only limited information on adverse interactions between ACE inhibitors and other cardiovascular or noncardiovascular drugs. The present article provides an overview of this issue, with emphasis on those interactions having the greatest clinical implications. In patients who have been sodium and/or volume depleted by thiazide or loop diuretics, the additional use of ACE inhibitors can lead to an excessive reduction in blood pressure and symptomatic hypotension. An increase in serum potassium levels may occur after coadministration of potassium-sparing diuretics and ACE inhibitors, resulting in hyperkalaemia especially in patients with renal insufficiency. The incidence of acute renal failure may be associated with ACE inhibitor therapy when these drugs are combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and given to patients whose renal function becomes increasingly dependent on angiotensin II and prostaglandins. There is some evidence, albeit scant, linking ACE inhibitors with the induction of lithium toxicity in patients maintained on lithium, and with the occurrence of severe hypersensitivity reactions in patients undergoing haemodialysis, venom immunisation or concomitant allopurinol therapy.
CAD continues to be the principal cause of mortality in the United States, and the largest group of patients with CAD are those with stable angina. Among this group of patients, the most common manifestation of CAD is presence of transient episodes of myocardial ischemia. The presence of transient ischemia and not the severity of angina has been found to be associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with stable CAD. As part of a global treatment strategy for patients with stable CAD, changes in lifestyle and modification of coronary risk factors should be emphasized as an integral part of treatment. Conventional antianginal therapy is quite effective in controlling anginal attacks. Currently, several drugs and therapeutic strategies are available for the treatment of patients with angina (see Table 5). Nitrates are highly effective antianginal drugs with complex beneficial actions in patients with CAD, but their usefulness is limited by development of tolerance during long-term use. When clinically indicated, the use of nitrates should be supplemented with another longer-acting antianginal drug, such as a beta-blocker or a calcium channel blocker. Based on the available data, beta-blockers, when tolerated, seem to be the most effective antianginal drugs for most patients with stable CAD. Beta-blockers are also the most effective anti-ischemic drugs that reduce the magnitude of myocardial ischemia detected during routine daily activities. Calcium channel blockers are also effective vasodilators and good antianginal drugs. The clinician should become familiar with the different actions that this heterogeneous group of drugs has on the heart and vessels. This knowledge allows the clinician to choose the appropriate combination of different antianginal drugs for patients on an individualized basis. It is also critical to develop the treatment strategy by carefully taking into account other associated medical conditions that are frequently encountered in patients with CAD.
CD36 is a glycoprotein included in the bovine milk fat globule membrane derived from mammary secretory epithelial cells during lactation. Asparagine-linked sugar chains were quantitatively released from CD36 as oligosaccharides by hydrazinolysis. These sugar chains were converted to radioactive oligosaccharides by reduction with NaB3H4 and separated into neutral and acidic fractions by paper electrophoresis. Most of the acidic oligosaccharides were converted to neutral ones by sialidase digestion, indicating that they are sialyl derivatives. The neutral and sialidase-treated acidic oligosaccharides were fractionated by Bio-Gel P-4 column chromatography in combination with serial chromatography on immobilized lectin columns including a Wistaria floribunda agglutinin (WFA)-agarose column. WFA is known to bind oligosaccharides terminating with either an alpha- or beta-N-acetylgalactosamine residue. Structural studies of oligosaccharides in each fraction by sequential exoglycosidase digestion as well as methylation analysis revealed that CD36 contains high mannose-type, hybrid-type, and bi, tri-, and tetraantennary complex-type sugar chains. A portion of the hybrid-type and the complex-type sugar chains which bound to a WFA-agarose column (28% of all oligosaccharides) contained the GalNAc beta 1-->4GlcNAc group(s) instead of the Gal beta 1-->4GlcNAc group(s) in their outer chain moieties. Like oligosaccharides found in human luteinizing hormone [Weisshaar, G., Hiyama, J., Renwick, A. G., & Nimtz, M. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 195, 257-268], some of the GalNAc beta 1-->4GlcNAc groups found in the CD36 oligosaccharides were sialylated as the Neu5Ac alpha 2-->6GalNAc group. Furthermore, most of the hybrid-type sugar chains of CD36 with the Gal/GalNAc beta 1-->4GlcNAc beta 1-->2 outer chain on their Man alpha 1-->3 arm contained an unusual Man alpha 1-->2Man alpha 1-->3 group on their Man alpha 1-->6 arm.
CFTR mRNA transcripts were analyzed from freshly isolated nasal epithelial cells and lymphocytes (six individuals) and from lymphocytes alone from 14 further individuals. In four of these 20 individuals alternative splicing was observed within the region coding for the first nucleotide binding fold. The RNA sequence between exons 10 and 13 was converted to cDNA and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We detected two PCR products of 583 bp and 464 bp in length. Direct sequencing of both fragments showed that the 583 bp PCR fragment contained an additional 119 bp sequence between exon 10 and exon 11, directly at the normal junction. This insertion contains an in frame stop codon and would, if translated, cause a shift in the reading frame. This stop codon does not result in an undetectable mRNA level as seen with other nonsense mutations within the same region of the CFTR gene (1, 2, own unpublished results). The alternatively spliced mRNA was found to be transcribed from both CF and normal alleles. The 119 bp fragment was amplified from genomic DNA and from the genomic phage TE24V, which includes exon 9, intron 9, exon 10 and a part of intron 10 (3) by PCR using primers created from within the inserted sequence. In addition, the insertion was mapped to a 1Kb EcoRI fragment of phage TE24V by Southern-blot analysis. By sequencing the insert surroundings within the phage TE24V we identified consensus splice sites (donor and acceptor sites, branch point). Furthermore no alterations were detected in the splice site sequences between individuals who express the aberrantly spliced product and those who do not.
CP 96,345 is a nonpeptide high affinity antagonist of the substance P (NK1) receptor. The radiosynthesis of [11C]CP 96,345 suitable for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) applications is described. [11C]CP 96,345 was prepared by O-methylation of a desmethyl precursor via in situ generation of its phenolate salt. The in vivo tissue distribution of [11C]CP 96,345 in guinea pigs (n = 2) at 5 and 30 min was determined. Uptake was low in brain (approximately 0.04% dose/g) and highest (approximately 1-2% dose/g) in the spleen and lungs. The present findings indicate that the use of [11C]CP 96,345 in PET might be more applicable to the study of substance P receptors in peripheral tissues involved with inflammatory disease and arthritis.
SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separates desmosomal proteins and glycoproteins of bovine tongue epithelium by their relative molecular mass. The Western immunoblot technique was used to reveal the reactions of desmosomal proteins and glycoproteins with naturally occurring antibodies in serum and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF). Naturally-occurring serum and GCF antibodies (IgG and IgM) from periodontitis patients and healthy, unaffected controls reacted with desmosomal proteins (desmoplakins) and glycoproteins (desmogleins). Sera from 90% of subjects with periodontitis showed increased reactions of IgG with desmoplakins (240 and 210 kDa) and 80% with desmogleins (165, 130, and 115 kDa), when compared with unaffected controls. Patients' IgG reacted with desmosomal components more strongly than IgM. IgG antibodies against desmosomal antigens in GCF showed similar specificities from patients and healthy subjects and to their serums. When GCF within individuals with periodontitis was compared, anti-desmosomal IgG from diseased sites showed greater reactivity than healthy controls. These data suggest that anti-desmosomal antibodies are a normal part of the immune repertoire. The presence of elevated titers of anti-desmosomal antibodies appear to distinguish periodontitis from unaffected sites. When detected, elevated titers of anti-desmosomal antibodies may contribute to the pathogenesis and indicate increased risk of periodontitis.
CD36 (glycoprotein [GP] IV) is a membrane GP of 88 kD found on monocytes, endothelial cells, and platelets. It may serve as a receptor for collagen and is also able to bind thrombospondin (TSP), because a monoclonal antibody to CD36 inhibits TSP binding to thrombin-stimulated platelets. In the following study, we investigated the subcellular distribution of CD36 within normal resting platelets, thrombin-stimulated platelets, and in cultured megakaryocytes (MK) by an immunogold staining technique and electron microscopy. We used an affinity-purified monospecific polyclonal antibody showing a single major band of precipitation at 88 kD via immunoblot analysis. In normal platelets, ultrastructural observation detected immunolabeling for CD36, homogeneously distributed along the platelet plasma membrane and in the luminal side of the open canalicular system (OCS). Moreover, some labeling was found around the alpha-granules along the inner face of their limiting membrane. An average of 70% of granules were labeled. The granule-associated pool of CD36 was estimated at approximately 25% of the total cell content. To exclude the possibility of a cross-reaction with GPIIb-IIIa, platelets from a patient with type I Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (which completely lack GPIIb-IIIa) were studied and showed a similar subcellular distribution of CD36, including alpha-granule membrane labeling. In activated platelets, CD36 was shown to be redistributed to the OCS and pseudopods of the plasma membrane. Platelets from a patient with the Gray platelet syndrome expressed CD36 on their plasma membrane, and some immunolabeling was also found within small abnormal alpha-granules. In cultured MK, CD36 immunolabeling was detected in the Golgi saccules, associated vesicles, immature alpha-granules, and demarcation membranes. In conclusion, this study shows the existence of a significant intragranular pool of CD36 in platelets that may play a critical role in the surface expression of alpha-granule TSP during platelet activation.
CYP1A2 is a cytochrome P450 which is inducible by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This induction could be mediated via the Ah locus, which encodes a cytosolic receptor responsible for the regulation of the CYP1A1 gene. Enzyme activity in vivo can be measured by the urinary caffeine metabolite ratio (AFMU + 1X + 1U)/17U. Our goal was to determine, using this ratio, the possible existence of a genetic polymorphism in CYP1A2 induction. For this purpose, a population and family study, including smokers, were undertaken. In a first step, we investigated factors influencing enzyme activity in a population of 245 unrelated individuals. The induction effect of smoking and inhibiting effect of oral contraceptive use were confirmed. None of the other factors examined (age, sex, level of cigarette consumption, nicotine or tar amounts, filter, inhalation) accounted for the interindividual variability in the metabolic ratio. Using the statistical SKUMIX method, a unimodal (one peak) distribution of the ratio was concluded in 164 unrelated smokers, since a second distribution did not significantly improve the fit to the data (chi 2(1) = 1.39, P > 0.2). Segregation analysis was performed on 68 nuclear families and no major gene effect could be shown. Furthermore, the polygenic model did not provide a higher likelihood than the sporadic one, which argues against the existence of any familial resemblance. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that some environmental factors could obscure the phenotypes and occult a genetic determinism, we conclude that genetic factors are probably negligible in the determination of CYP1A2 activity measured by this method.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
CD38 is a 42 kDa membrane-associated ectoenzyme expressed by a large proportion of human and mouse lymphocytes. Agonistic antibodies to CD38 induce a strong proliferative response in lymphocytes additionally co-stimulated with other growth co-factors such as IL-4, IL-2 plus accessory cells or sub-mitogenic doses of endotoxin. We show here that B lymphocytes from unstimulated X-linked immunodeficient (xid) mice are unresponsive to CD38 stimulation, both in terms of proliferative response and surface antigen modulation. This CD38 unresponsiveness is evident in the presence of excess quantities of, and normal responses to, the accessory growth co-stimulants required for this response. CD38 molecules expressed on xid B cells are normal in terms of expression levels, size and enzymatic activity, suggesting that CD38 unresponsiveness reflects a down-stream signaling defect. In light of the recent proposal that the xid gene encodes a tyrosine kinase called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (btk), these data suggest that btk is either an integral component or an indirect regulator of the CD38-induced signal transduction pathway.
CYP2E1 catalyzes the metabolic activation of tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines, including 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone. An Rsa I polymorphism, which is located in the 5'-flanking region of the CYP2E1 gene, has been found to affect the transcriptional regulation of the gene, resulting in different expression levels of the mRNA among individuals. In order to investigate an association between the Rsa I polymorphism and lung cancer susceptibility, the genotype distribution among 316 lung cancer patients was compared with that in 503 healthy controls. No statistically significant association was found between the Rsa I polymorphism and an increased risk of lung cancer, even though histological types of lung cancer, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were taken into account.
CFTR is the major Cl- channel in several epithelia, but its importance in airway cells and its interactions with other channels are still poorly understood. We studied the role of CFTR and other Cl- channels in two well-differentiated human airway cell lines--16HBE and Calu-3. Both lines form tight junctions, and the Calu-3 line exhibits large currents in the Ussing chamber that represent Cl- secretion. Apical membrane Cl- conductance in both cell lines in mediated primarily and possibly exclusively by CFTR, because (1) CFTR channels are almost the only anion channels observed in cell-attached patches from confluent cells, (2) whole-cell Cl- current has a linear, time-independent signature, and (3) blockers of many Cl- channels, such as DIDS, do not block Isc. Outwardly rectifying (ORDIC) channels were identified in both airway cell lines. Activation of ORDIC channels in Calu-3 cells required 3 conditions: (1) stimulation with isoproterenol, (2) excision and depolarization, and (3) prior treatment of the cell to disrupt tight junctions. To further assess the physiological significance of ORDIC channels, we compared cell lines which have > 10-fold difference in functional expression of ORDIC channels. ORDIC channel expression was not associated with swelling-activated Cl- currents.
CD38 is a 42-kDa membrane associated enzyme which converts NAD into cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a Ca(2+)-mobilizing second messenger, and ADP-ribose (ADPR). Agonistic antibodies to murine CD38 deliver a potent growth co-stimulus to mature splenic B lymphocytes. In this report we demonstrate a striking relationship between CD38-mediated mitogenesis and the ability of surface IgM to promote B cell proliferation. Tolerized B lymphocytes obtained from a double-transgenic mouse model of B cell tolerance do not proliferate in response to antigen stimulation through the Ig receptor or to agonistic anti-CD38 antibodies. Similarly, B-1 cells isolated from the peritoneal cavity of normal mice, and splenic B cells isolated from newborn mice were also unresponsive to both anti-IgM and anti-CD38 stimulation. All of these CD38-unresponsive B cells expressed normal levels of cell surface CD38 and responded to numerous other stimuli. CD38 immunoprecipitated from these B cell populations was normal in size and effectively hydrolyzed NAD, suggesting that the defect in CD38 signaling likely occurs downstream of CD38 itself. Signaling through CD38 and IgM does not always have identical effects on B cells since anti-CD38 cannot deliver inhibitory growth or differentiation signals to normal B cells or immature B cell lines. Nevertheless, the correlative data with these multiple B cell models of unresponsiveness suggests that the signaling pathway utilized by CD38 and IgM intersect, possibly sharing at least one of the crucial components of the Ig receptor signaling cascade.
CYP11B1 (11 beta-hydroxylase) and CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) are steroidogenic enzymes which mediate the final step (11 beta-hydroxylation) in cortisol synthesis and the final three steps (11 beta-hydroxylation, 18-hydroxylation, and 18-oxidation) in aldosterone synthesis, respectively. The enzymes share 93% identity in amino acid sequence and are encoded by two structurally similar genes which are located in tandem on chromosome 8q22, approximately 40 kb apart. Expression of the aldosterone synthase gene (CYP11B2) is limited to the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, thereby limiting the synthesis of aldosterone to that zone, where it is principally regulated by plasma levels of angiotensin II and potassium. The 11 beta-hydroxylase gene (CYP11B1) is expressed in the zona fasciculata, the zone which also expresses a 17-hydroxylase activity, where it mediates cortisol synthesis under the control of ACTH. Genetic recombination involving a mispairing of the two CYP11B genes can lead to duplications and deletions of the genes, creation of hybrid genes of several forms, or transfer of coding and regulatory sequences from one gene to the other. Since the two genes have related but different activities, are normally expressed in different zones, and respond to different physiological signals, such recombination has the potential to generate a variety of inherited disorders of steroid production. In this paper we review the range of mutations which can occur and the resulting disorders of steroid biosynthesis, and suggest some novel mutations which might be sought in variants of these endocrinological syndromes.
APRT deficiency is an enzyme disorder which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The use of adenine in purine metabolism is disturbed and it accumulates in the body, where it is oxidised by xanthine oxidase to poorly insoluble 2, 8-dihydroxyadenine (DHA). The dihydroxyadenine forms stones which cause recurrent urolithiasis, frequent episodes of urinary tract infection or interstitial nephritis, and finally renal insufficiency in some cases. We report a case of APRT deficiency discovered by urine examination. The patient was a 33-year-old man who had never had any episodes of urolithiasis. He was admitted to our hospital because of pseudoarthrosis of his left arm caused by a traffic accident. His urinalysis revealed no proteinuria nor hematuria, but disclosed numerous round brown crystals in the sediment. These crystals had the characteristics of 2, 8-DHA. The enzyme activity of APRT in his blood was completely deficient. He was diagnosed as an APRT* QO homozygote. In addition, diagnostic imaging revealed that his right kidney was poorly hypoplastic and the pelvis of his left kidney was extra-renal. The renal function was slightly disturbed. In Japan 6 cases of 2, 8-DHA urolithiasis associated with hypoplastic kidney had been reported by 1989. Theoretically, the incidence of hypoplastic kidney is around 20% of all 2, 8-DHA urolithiasis cases. We suspect a genetic correlation between hypoplastic kidney and APRT deficiency. This patient was treated with Allopurinol, which inhibits the process of xanthine oxidation, after which crystals were no longer detected in his urine.
CD38 has been used as a phenotype marker of lymphocyte differentiation. Recently, we have demonstrated that cyclic ADP-ribose can be synthesized and hydrolyzed by CD38 and acts as a second messenger in insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells. We have mapped the CD38 gene to human chromosome 4p15 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
ACE inhibitors induce an increase in kinin levels with subsequent release of nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin, as shown in cultured endothelial cells and isolated rat hearts. Isolated perfused working rat hearts continuously release kinins and prostacyclin. During ischemia after ligation of the left coronary artery kinin and prostacyclin concentrations in the venous effluent of the hearts are increased. ACE inhibition with ramiprilat increases kinin concentrations during normoxia, ischemia and reperfusion, whereas deendothelialization markedly reduces kinin and prostacyclin outflow in controls as well as in ACE inhibitor-treated hearts. Rat hearts with postischemic reperfusion arrhythmias are protected by ramiprilat- and bradykinin perfusion, cardiodynamics and metabolism of treated hearts are improved. These effects are observed in concentrations too low to increase coronary flow. The cardioprotective effects of ramiprilat and bradykinin are abolished by the specific B2-kinin receptor antagonist icatibant and by an inhibitor of NO-synthase. Long-term treatment (20 weeks) with ramipril in a blood-pressure-lowering dose (1 mg/kg/day) and a subantihypertensive dose (10 micromg/kg/day) protects spontaneously hypertensive rats (stroke prone) against hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy in the high dose. In addition, both treatment regimens induce myocardial capillary growth. Isolated hearts of these animals show increased myocardial contractility and coronary flow, reduced release of cytosolic enzymes into the coronary effluent, and improved myocardial metabolism. These changes are observed even at a dose of ramipril which does not affect blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy. They are abolished by chronic blockade of kinin receptors with icatibant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
CYP2D6 genotyping was carried out by XbaI restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and polymerase chain reaction in 168 healthy Danish volunteers, 77 extensive metabolizers (EM) and 91 poor metabolizers (PM) of sparteine. All EM were genotyped correctly as heterozygous or homozygous for the functional (wild type) gene, D6-wt. However, the D6-wt gene was apparently also present in 11 (12%) of the PM who accordingly were incorrectly genotyped as EM. The specificity of genotyping PM thus was 100% but the sensitivity was only 88%. The most common allele was the D6-wt with an apparent frequency of 0.741 (0.026) in the Danish population and the second most common allele was the D6-B with an apparent frequency of 0.194 (0.024). The median (range) of the sparteine metabolic ratio (MR) in 47 homozygous D6-wt EM was 0.28 (0.11-4.10) and the corresponding value in heterozygous EM was 0.36 (0.11-9.10). The median difference was 0.09 (95% confidence interval: 0.02-0.16). CYP2D6 phenotyping is a promising tool in tailoring the individual dose of tricyclic antidepressants, some neuroleplics and some antiarrhythmics. However if the genotype test could be improved with regard to both sensitivity in PM and the ability to predict CYP2D6 activity in EM then it would be of even greater clinical value in therapeutic drug monitoring.
CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in many cell types, including lymphoid progenitors and activated lymphocytes. High levels of CD38 expression on immature lymphoid cells suggest its role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, but there is no evidence demonstrating a functional activity of CD38 on these cells. We used stroma-supported cultures of B cell progenitors and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (T16 and IB4) to study CD38 function. In cultures of normal bone marrow CD19+ cells (n = 5), addition of anti-CD38 markedly reduced the number of cells recovered after 7 d. Cell loss was greatest among CD19+ sIg- B cell progenitors (mean cell recovery +/- SD = 7.2 +/- 11.7% of recovery in control cultures) and extended to CD19+CD34+ B cells (the most immature subset; 7.6 +/- 2.2%). In contrast, CD38 ligation did not substantially affect cell numbers in cultures of normal peripheral blood or tonsillar B cells. In stroma-supported cultures of 22 B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases, anti-CD38 suppressed recovery of CD19+ sIg- leukemic cells. CD38 ligation also suppressed the growth of immature lymphoid cell lines cultured on stroma and, in some cases, in the presence of stroma-derived cytokines (interleukin [IL] 7, IL-3, and/or stem cell factor), but did not inhibit growth in stroma- or cytokine-free cultures. DNA content and DNA fragmentation studies showed that CD38 ligation of stroma-supported cells resulted in both inhibition of DNA synthesis and induction of apoptosis. It is known that CD38 catalyzes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) hydrolysis into cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and ADPR. However, no changes in NAD+ hydrolysis or cADPR and ADPR production after CD38 ligation were found by high-performance liquid chromatography; addition of NAD+, ADPR, or cADPR to cultures of lymphoid progenitors did not offset the inhibitory effects of anti-CD38. Thus, anti-CD38 does not suppress B lymphopoiesis by altering the enzymatic function of the molecule. In conclusion, these data show that CD38 ligation inhibits the growth of immature B lymphoid cells in the bone marrow microenvironment, and suggest that CD38 interaction with a putative ligand represents a novel regulatory mechanism of B lymphopoiesis.
CD38 has been implicated in the regulation of both proliferation and rescue from apoptosis of B cells. The signalling events associated with CD38-mediated activation of murine B cells are, as yet, not well defined but it is clear that ligation of CD38 by a mitogenic antibody, NIMR-5, induces a calcium influx in resting B cells. Interestingly, however, cross-linking of CD38 does not mobilize intracellular stores of calcium. We now provide a rationale for these findings by demonstrating that CD38 is not coupled to the generation of inositol phosphates in resting B cells. We do, however, show that CD38 ligation stimulates one, or more, protein tyrosine kinase activities which may play a central role in the transduction of CD38-mediated signals leading to B-cell activation.
"CNP (2,3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase) is the earliest myelination specific polypeptide to be synthesized by oligodendrocytes (OLs). When non-myelinating ""naive"" cells are transfected with the rat CNP cDNA, CNP accumulates intracellularly in a punctate manner, as well as at the plasma membrane. Filopodia and processes, like those of OLs become elongated and more numerous, and are filled with this protein. Post-translational isoprenylation of the terminal C-T-I-I sequence with either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl is essential for this phenomenon. In contrast, the non-isoprenylated C397S mutant is homogeneously distributed throughout the cytoplasm and does not markedly affect cellular morphology. We have synthesized CNP and the C397S mutant in vitro and have shown that isoprenylation is essential for the binding of newly synthesized CNP to myelin."
ACE inhibitors are used world-wide for treatment of hypertension and cardiac failure; liver damage is a rare but potentially severe side-effect of these drugs. In this case report we describe a patient with chronic liver damage due to lisinopril.
CA1 pyramidal cell response (population spike) in the hippocampal slice preparation was monitored after electrical stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals at CA2 in the presence of different concentrations of memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane, Akatinol Memantine, CAS 41100-52-1) currently being prescribed for the treatment of e.g. dementia. Memantine increased the amplitude of the population spike by 100% compared to the predrug level with an EC50 of approximately 8 mumol/l. Long-term potentiation induced by a brief theta stimulus was likewise increased by a factor of 2. The concentration dependent action of D-serine, an agonist acting at the strychnine insensitive glycine-site of the NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartic acid) receptor was enhanced in the presence of 1 mumol/l of memantine. These effects of memantine were antagonized completely by very low concentrations of the selective non-NMDA receptor antagonist NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzoe (F) quinoxyline) as well as by less selective antagonists such as DNQX (6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) and CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione). In contrast, dizocilpine tested under identical conditions and in concordance with the literature decreased long-term potentiation. Thus, memantine clearly has different effects on glutamatergic synaptic transmission compared to dizocilpine. The ability of memantine to enhance synaptic transmission in the hippocampus is in concordance with the reported positive influence on cognition deficits in humans.
CYP4B1 is a P450 enzyme displaying tissue and species specific regulation. The rabbit CYP4B1 enzyme exhibits activity towards procarcinogenic aromatic amines. In the present study, CYP4B1 expression has been characterized in rabbit tissues using histological techniques, Northern blotting and Western blotting. Similar analyses were attempted using available human tissues. CYP4B1 mRNA and protein was demonstrated throughout the rabbit small intestine and colon. A unique 1.8 kb transcript, that is smaller than the transcript found in other tissues, was detected in rabbit stomach with a CYP4B1 specific RNA probe. No CYP4B1 protein was detected in this tissue. In rabbit liver, CYP4B1 was induced by phenobarbital primarily in zone 1 hepatocytes (periportal). In humans, CYP4B1 expression was demonstrated at low levels in human colon using in situ hybridization but not in liver or the small intestine. All rabbit gastrointestinal tissues other than stomach possess a high capacity for the activation of 2-aminofluorene compatible with CYP4B1 expression. In contrast, no activity was observed in human gastrointestinal microsomes. The present study therefore shows that CYP4B1 is an abundant P450 in the rabbit gastrointestinal tract and identifies species-specific differences in CYP4B1 expression and function.
HPD is a clinical entity characterized by childhood-onset postural dystonia, which shows marked diurnal fluctuation (aggravation of symptoms towards evening and their alleviation in the morning after sleep), and dramatic and sustained response to levodopa without any adverse effects, such as wearing-off or dyskinesia. Since the first report by Segawa et al. (1971), many cases have been reported under the title HPD or related nomenclature. In this review, we describe details of clinical features and recent laboratory studies of HPD, to differentiate it from other disorders manifesting dystonia in childhood. It has been suggested that HPD has a genetically determined abnormality, being restricted to the terminals of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, which results in reduced dopamine content.
CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, which is widely used as a marker for immature and activated lymphocytes, as well as plasma cells. Although its functional role and natural ligand are not known, CD38 has been shown to transduce activation signals to lymphocytes. Our work shows that CD38 is preferentially expressed by CD4+CD45RA+ cells, but not by CD4+CD45R0+ cells. CD4+CD45RA+ cells are reported to respond poorly to stimuli acting through the CD3/TCR in vitro and to display unique migration pathways in vivo. Cross-linking of CD38 by mAb did not overcome the hyporesponsiveness of CD4+ resting/naive cells to several activation stimuli; in contrast, CD38 engagement by mAb specifically inhibited their binding with human vein endothelial cells. These data suggest that CD38 may play a role in lymphocyte migration. The same inhibitory effect was detected on the (human x mouse) hybrid cell line CP410.A10, which expresses human CD38, but not on its CD38- subclone CP14. CD38 mAb did not inhibit the conventional binding assay between endothelium and several human CD38+ T and B cell lines. However, the inhibition was apparent when the binding assay was performed at 4 degrees C on a rocking shelf, conditions that minimized integrin function. These data suggest that CD38 mediates weak cell binding to endothelium, which is effective even in dynamic conditions. These features are reminiscent of those exerted by selectins, which are adhesion molecules that account for leukocyte rolling on vascular endothelial cells and play an important role in lymphocyte homing.
ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors are revolutionizing the management of heart failure and are now earning themselves a place in the early treatment of post myocardial infarction (MI) patients who have evidence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or, more modestly, evidence of infarct expansion. The aims of ACE inhibitor therapy are to control symptoms, if any, and to improve prognosis. For these indications, they are impressive. Nonetheless, they are not a panacea. Post MI patients face a variety of threats, not least from progression of their underlying ischemic disease, and they should not be denied prognostically advantageous interventions, such as beta-blockers and aspirin. Moreover, ACE inhibitor monotherapy may not be the best management for heart failure itself. The role of other additive agents should not be dismissed.
CAD is a multifunctional protein which mediates the first three enzymatic steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis. Previous studies have implicated CAD as a cell cycle regulated protein. In the present paper CAD activity is studied as polyclonally stimulated, murine B cells progress through the early stages of the cell cycle. CAD activity is seen to increase in a biphasic manner. The initial increase in activity occurs prior to or as the cells increase CAD mRNA suggesting that post-translational modification of preformed enzyme may account for at least a portion of this initial enhancement. Increases in CAD mRNA occur by 12 hr poststimulation and precede the second, more dramatic increase in B cell CAD activity. Preliminary experiments failed to provide support of a role for IL-4 in regulating the expression of CAD as B cells progress into G1. CAD enzymatic activity does represent, however, a marker for early B cell cycle progression.
GPD1 (encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) is a constitutively expressed gene in Cochliobolus heterostrophus that produces a single transcript. The steady state level of GPD1 mRNA is 14-fold greater than that of the constitutively-expressed TRP1 gene (encoding a tryptophan biosynthesis enzyme) indicating that GPD1 has a stronger promoter and/or a more stable mRNA. A set of lacZ translational fusion vectors was constructed to compare the gene expression signals of GPD1, TRP1 and PRO1 (a C. heterostrophus genomic fragment selected for promoter activity) in C. heterostrophus as single copies at the same site in the chromosome. Under conditions that repressed endogenous beta-galactosidase expression, beta-galactosidase activity in transformants was constitutive and required the GPD1, TRP1 or PRO1 expression signals. In-frame GPD1::lacZ activities were 6-fold greater than in-frame TRP1::lacZ and PRO1::lacZ activities, indicating that GPD1 has more efficient expression signals.
MPO deficiency, as first studied in the 1960s, has been recorded with increasing frequency, following the introduction of the automated cytochemical count into clinical routine. However, with regard to the diseases correlated to MPO deficiency, no exact data on the frequency of co-existence have been recorded. Moreover, the question remains whether or not a further deficiency of other granular enzymes co-exists, especially with regard to acquired MPO deficiency. In order to answer these questions, an epidemiological study of more than 70,000 unselected patients was performed; the resulting prevalence of MPO deficiency was 0.15%. Within this patient group the intercellular content of elastase-like protease (ELP) and lactoferrin was measured semiquantitatively in a flow cytometer by means of indirect immunofluorescence staining. The frequency of coinciding diseases did not differ from the frequency of diseases in the hospital patients in general. The flow-cytometric studies revealed a normal content of ELP and lactoferrin in one group and a reduced content in another, suggesting the inherited form in the former and acquired MPO deficiencies in the latter group and thus indicating that differing mechanisms characterize the two forms of MPO deficiency. Nevertheless, we do not suggest distinguishing between acquired and inherited deficiencies solely with this technique. Instead, molecular-biologic and/or genetic methods should be referred to.
AGA and AGG codons for arginine are the least used codons in Escherichia coli. Previous findings have shown that these codons are used preferentially within the first 25 codons in E. coli genes. More than 100 genes having a single AGA/AGG codon within the first 25 codons were identified to be associated with various essential cellular functions. The lacZ gene, containing 5 AGG codons after the tenth codon from the initiation codon, was constructed as a model system. The production of beta-galactosidase was inhibited almost completely during the stationary phase, whereas the production of the control beta-galactosidase without AGG codons was not. The inhibitory effect by the 5 AGG codons was substantially suppressed either by coexpressing the argU gene for tRNA(ArgUCU/CCU) or by moving the 5 AGG codons by > 50 codons away from the initiation codon. In addition, the production of a number of proteins resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was enhanced significantly during the stationary phase in the cells harboring a plasmid containing argU. At least one of them was identified as the hns product encoded by an ORF having an AGA codon at the nineteenth position. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that the expression of a group of essential genes for various cellular functions that have a single AGA/AGG codon very close to the initiation codon are globally regulated by the availability of the least abundant tRNA(ArgUCU/CCU). A model for this regulation is proposed.
TAT stories of 17 sexually abused female subjects and a clinical group of 25 female subjects with no documented history of sexual abuse were analyzed using the Object Relations and Social Cognition Scoring System (Western, Lohr, Silk, Kerber, & Goodrich, 1985). Subjects ranged in age from 5 to 16 years. As predicted, mean scores on a measure of overall object relations were significantly different between groups. Specifically, the mental representations of subjects in the abuse group were characterized by more primitive and simple characterizations of people, more negative and punitive affect in their perceptions of the interpersonal world, an inability to invest in people and relationships in other than need-gratifying ways, and an inability to make sensible attributions of self and others. Abuse subjects also produced more pathological responses overall than did their nonabuse counterparts, indicating a tendency toward more extreme and immature functioning. These group differences were independent of any contribution of age and a measure of verbal productivity. Treatment and diagnostic implications are discussed.
ACE inhibitors have been shown to worsen the kidney damage occurring distal to a renal artery stenosis. To determine if this effect was due to the decrease of arterial pressure or to an inhibition of the formation of angiotensin, we compared the effects of equihypotensive doses of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) and a long-acting calcium antagonist (Ro 40-5967) in 2K-1C rats. The rats were treated for five weeks with either enalapril, Ro 40-5967, or were left untreated. A group of sham operated rats was used as control. At the end of the five-week treatment period, proteinuria, plasma urea and creatinine were measured and quantitative morphometry of the clipped and unclipped kidneys was performed. Ro 40-5967, despite an absence of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, worsened the lesions of the clipped kidney to the same extent as enalapril. In contrast, the effects of both drugs on the unclipped kidney were different. Ro 40-5967, and not enalapril, increased the weight and the glomerular surface area of the unclipped kidney. Ro 40-5967 did not change the glomerulosclerosis index, which was improved by enalapril. In contrast with enalapril, Ro 40-5967 decreased plasma urea and creatinine concentrations. Only enalapril decreased proteinuria which originated from the unclipped kidney as shown by nephrectomy experiments. We conclude that during ACE inhibition the fall in renal perfusion pressure seems to be the main determinant of the renal damage distal to a renal artery stenosis, independently of a blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
CYP1A1 is a gene of the cytochrome P-450 family that has been proposed to be a biomarker of cancer risk. We introduce a polymerase chain reaction-based assay to measure allelic variability in exon 7 of the CYP1A1 gene. This genetic variant is associated with an amino acid change at residue 462 in the aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase protein product. Previously, measurement of CYP1A1 genotypes at this variant site required two assays, one to detect each allele. By using three primers in a single polymerase chain reaction rather than two primers in each of two polymerase chain reactions, the proposed assay may facilitate population-based study protocols. We estimate the frequency of this polymorphism in a Caucasian population to be 0.03, with an observed heterozygosity of 0.06. We have also confirmed the Mendelian segregation of this polymorphism in four multigeneration Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain families and have placed this locus in a multilocus linkage map on chromosome 15q. The distribution of this polymorphism was the same in breast cancer cases as in two sets of healthy controls.
ACE inhibitors and diuretics should be used in combination in the majority of patients with clinical congestive heart failure. The broad spectrum of heart failure should include the phase of significant left ventricular dysfunction without overt clinical heart failure for which ACE inhibitor treatment alone may be beneficial in selected cases.
ACE inhibitors improve not only symptoms and signs of heart failure in patients with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction but also lead to a slower progression of heart failure. In asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction, the progression to symptomatic heart failure is retarded by ACE inhibitors. As heart failure is preceded in about 80% by myocardial infarctions, trials were designed to influence the development of heart failure after myocardial infarction. It could be shown that therapy with ACE inhibitors ameliorates the progressive left ventricular dilatation and that this effect is translated into a significant increase of life expectancy. Mainly based on the CONSENSUS I study, large doses of ACE inhibitors were used in most subsequent trials. The mean daily doses of enalapril were 18.4 mg in the CONSENSUS I trial and 16.6 and 16.7 mg in both arms of the SOLVD trial. There is a trend towards lower doses of ACE inhibitors, as in the SAVE trial only 79% of the patients taking captopril received the target dose of 150 mg daily. Smaller studies used similar target doses, but a beneficial effect on left ventricular enlargement has been shown with a daily dose of only 75 mg captopril. Based on the hypothesis that the left ventricular enlargement is mainly determined by the activation of the local cardiac renin angiotensin system, even lower, and therefore better tolerated, doses of ACE inhibitors may prove effective. However, studies comparing the effect of different doses of ACE inhibitors on left ventricular remodeling are missing. Consequently, the above-mentioned target doses of ACE inhibitors should be aimed at when treating patients after myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
NSF and SNAPs (soluble NSF attachment proteins), originally identified as cytosolic components of intracellular vesicular transport mechanisms, have recently been implicated in Ca(2+)-triggered neurotransmitter release from synaptic terminals. Here, we have investigated the temporal and spatial expression pattern of the rodent NSF and SNAP genes. A single transcript of 4.5 kb is highly expressed in rat brain, whereas only minor amounts of NSF mRNA are found in liver, kidney, heart, lung and skeletal muscle. In situ hybridisation revealed NSF transcripts as early as embryonic day 10 preferentially in the nervous system of mouse embryos. In the adult brain NSF is widely expressed with particularly high levels in the hippocampus. An identical expression profile was observed for alpha/beta-SNAP. Our data are consistent with a central function of NSF and SNAPs in neurotransmission.
ACE inhibitors, as well as aminocephalosporins with peptide-like structures, are transported by the intestinal peptide carrier. We investigated the transport mechanism using intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles from rabbits and observed that enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and substrate of the peptide carrier, noncompetitively inhibited the uptake of cephradine, an aminocephalosporin and substrate of the peptide carrier, with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 2.6 mM when it was present on the cis side (outside) of the vesicles. By contrast, enalaprilat, cefadroxil and GlyPro competitively inhibited cephradine transport with Ki values of 5.4, 3.8 and 5.1, respectively. These results suggest the presence of an enalapril-specific inhibitory binding site on the peptide carrier. In addition, enalapril on the trans side (inside) of the vesicles inhibited the uptake of cephradine, suggesting an apparent reduction of carrier availability by a trapping mechanism. On the other hand, cefadroxil stimulated the uptake of cephradine in the trans experiment, consistent with the concept of countertransport. These findings reveal the uniqueness of enalapril regarding its mode of interaction with the peptide carrier(s) which has been of increasing interest regarding its role in the intestinal absorption of peptide-type drugs.
DBT cells and several transfected cell lines which express antisense or sense RNA against the nucleocapsid protein gene of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) were examined for the yields of MHV. The transfected cells showed 95 and 99% reduction of virus yield at 9 and 12 hr postinfection (p.i.) as compared with untransfected DBT cells. A remarkable decrease in MHV-specific RNA synthesis was observed in both transfected cell lines at 3.5 hr p.i. The result suggested that both antisense and sense RNAs inhibited viral replication at the initial stage of infection.
G6PD Konan and G6PD Ube are the most common glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) variants found in Japan. To clarify the molecular abnormality of these two variants, the entire coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA (G6PD Konan) or cDNA (G6PD Ube). Direct sequencing revealed that both variants have the same nucleotide substitution (241 C to T) in exon 4, which predicts an Arg to Cys substitution at amino acid 81.
ABO matched cynomolgus monkey to baboon heterotopic xenografts were performed using three different immunosuppressant regimens. Group 1 (n = 4) baboons, which did not receive immunosuppression, had a mean graft survival of 9 days. Group 2 (n = 6) received cyclosporine (CsA) and methylprednisolone acetate which prolonged graft survival to an average of 78 days. Group 3 (n = 5) received CsA, Pred, and azathioprine (Aza) as well as steroid pulses and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) for rejection episodes. Survival in this group averaged 94 days. In Group 4 (n = 3), the same regimen as group 3 was used; however, Mycophenolate Mofetil was substituted for Aza. This resulted in a mean survival of 296 days. Histologic examination of the coronary vasculature in baboons treated with Mofetil showed a reduction in vascular pathologic changes when compared to those treated with Aza. Long-term cardiac xenograft survival is possible using currently available immunosuppressive agents.
ADA supports achievement of comprehensive nutrition standards in child care programs. The standards recommended here focus on meeting the child's nutrition needs and providing a safe and pleasant environment that promotes acquisition of habits that prevent disease and enable healthy growth and development. Nutrition and health professionals can play a powerful role in advocating and assisting the acceptance of child care nutrition standards by parents, caregivers, foodservice personnel, and directors and policy makers for child care programs.
SCD is a tragic-event that rarely affects exercising individuals. It is important for the practitioner to recognize the normal physiologic changes that occur in the exercising athlete that correspond to AHS so as to differentiate them from conditions placing an athlete at risk for SCD. Different clinical entities account for SCD in athletes under age 30 as opposed to over age 30, although there is some overlap. Comprehensive and expensive screening tests have not proved to be cost-effective, nor are they able consistently to identify athletes at risk. A quality history and thorough cardiac screening examination are the best means to identify athletes at risk for SCD and lead to a cost-effective means to pursue further workup. Table 7 lists a screening battery of tests and what the tests detect and miss. In general, a history and physical examination detect aortic stenosis and a portion of HCM and Marfan's syndrome. If the physical examination is suggestive of Marfan's syndrome and a chest roentgenogram is done, a larger portion of cystic medial necrosis will be found. When an ECG is added to the series, most of the HCM patients at risk for SCD can be diagnosed. In addition, if echocardiography is added, most patients with HCM and cystic medial necrosis can be identified. If an exercise stress test is then performed, 20% of coronary artery disease and congenital artery anomalies are identified. Additional studies, including Holter monitoring, electrophysiologic studies, and thallium scintigraphy, can be added to identify further at-risk patients. Because some asymptomatic patients present with SCD, it is virtually impossible to identify comprehensively all patients at risk. By knowing what questions to ask, performing a thorough cardiac screening examination, and being more aware of potential diagnostic clues, the practitioner can feel comfortable in identifying most patients at risk for SCD. Specific history and physical examination guidelines regarding screening for competition are included. Supplemental information is found in the 16th Bethesda Conference. In addition, a well-outlined emergency plan needs to be established when physicians, athletic trainers, or coaches are working with athletes. Proper recognition of cardiac symptoms is a key point. Appropriate education including basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation training should be encouraged for anyone working extensively with athletes. The emergency plan should include on-site treatment, mechanism to contact emergency personnel, and proper transport to a qualified facility.
ACE inhibitor challenged renal scintigraphic studies offer noninvasive means of evaluating patients for renovascular hypertension, and provide help in selecting patients who will benefit most from interventional procedures designed for alleviation of renal artery stenosis. These studies provide functional assessment of each kidney which also helps the vascular surgeons to plan which renal artery to repair first, when bilateral renal arteries are stenotic, prior to an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Vasotec challenged Tc99mMAG3 renal scintigraphy is one of such tests with several advantages over other similar methods, and appears to have a great potential of being a preferred scintigraphic study for evaluation of renovascular hypertension.
PC hydrolysis by PLA2, PLC or PLD is a widespread response elicited by most growth factors, cytokines, neurotransmitters, hormones and other extracellular signals. The mechanisms can involve G-proteins, PKC, Ca2+ and tyrosine kinase activities. Although an agonist-responsive cytosolic PLA2 has been purified, cloned and sequenced, the agonist-responsive form(s) of PC-PLC has not been identified and no form of PC-PLD has been purified or cloned. Regulation of PLA2 by Ca2+ and MAPK is well established and involves membrane translocation and phosphorylation, respectively. PKC regulation of the enzyme in intact cells is probably mediated by MAPK. The question of G-protein control of PLA2 remains controversial since the nature of the G-protein is unknown and it is not established that its interaction with the enzyme is direct or not. Growth factor regulation of PLA2 involves tyrosine kinase activity, but not necessarily PKC. It may be mediated by MAPK. The physiological significance of PLA2 activation is undoubtedly related to the release of AA for eicosanoid production, but the LPC formed may have actions also. There is much evidence that PKC regulates PC-PLC and PC-PLD and this is probably a major mechanism by which agonists that promote PI hydrolysis secondarily activate PC hydrolysis. Since no agonist-responsive forms of either phospholipase have been isolated, it is not clear that PKC exerts its effects directly on the enzymes. Although it is assumed that a phosphorylation mechanism is involved, this may not be the case, and regulation may be by protein-protein interactions. G-protein control of PC-PLD is well-established, although, again, it has not been demonstrated that this is direct, and the nature of the G-protein(s) involved is unknown. In some cell types, there is evidence of the participation of a soluble protein, which may be a low Mr GTP-binding protein. What role this plays in the activation of PC-PLD is obscure. Agonist activation of PC hydrolysis in cells is usually Ca(2+)-dependent, but the step at which Ca2+ is involved is unclear, since PC-PLD and PC-PLC per se are not influenced by physiological concentrations of the ion. Most growth factors promote PC hydrolysis and this is mainly due to activation of PKC as a result of PI breakdown. However, in some cases, PC breakdown occurs in the absence of PI hydrolysis, implying another mechanism that does not involve PI-derived DAG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
ABO incompatibility is now the most common cause of isoimmune hemolytic disease of the newborn here. Although hemolytic disease because of ABO incompatibility is clinically milder than that from Rh incompatibility, severe hemolysis occasionally occurs, and some cases require exchange transfusion. It is desirable to assess the accuracy of a group of tests to predict the development of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in ABO incompatibility. Then, early treatment is available for minimizing the frequency of exchange transfusion.
TPO is the key enzyme involved in the thyroid hormone synthesis. The human TPO (hTPO) gene locates on chromosome 2 and consists of 17 exons and 16 introns. Compared with other peroxidases, hTPO is 42% homologous with granulocyte myeloperoxidase. Thyroid cells contain multiple TPO mRNA transcripts of various size. However, the reason is unknown. TTF-1 and TTF-2 are known to regulate TPO gene expression. Moreover, the other factors are becoming clear to regulate it. Congenital TPO defects result in hypothyroidism and goiter. Recent studies clarify a human mutation causing TPO deficiency.
ACE inhibitors are becoming an important part of treatment in patients after acute myocardial infarction if they suffer from asymptomatic dysfunction of the left ventricle (ejection fraction of the left ventricle evaluated by echocardiography or isotope ventriculography 40% or less). It prevents the development of cardiac dilatation, it retards progression of the disease and the development of cardiac failure and reduces the necessity of hospitalization in patients with chronic cardiac failure (stage NYHA II-IV). ACE inhibitors are the drug of choice as they reduce significantly the general mortality of these patients. Treatment should not be initiated in the acute stage but after several days have elapsed after infarction, unless contraindications of treatment are present. Extensive investigations made during the past two years revealed moreover that ACE inhibitors effectively prevent also relapses of myocardial infarction or the development of unstable angina pectoris. Prevention of coronary attacks is most probably due to several effects of ACE inhibitors: a) reduction of blood pressure, b) coronary vasodilatation, c) the antiproliferative action of ACE inhibitors on vascular musculature, d) prevention of progression of atherosclerosis, e) prevention of myocardial hypertrophy, f) the favourable effect on endothelial function. So far we indicate for treatment with ACE inhibitors only patients after acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction. Only subsequent research will show whether treatment with ACE inhibitors is of value in patients with preserved left ventricular function.
CD38 is a 42-kilodalton glycoprotein expressed extensively on B and T lymphocytes. CD38 exhibits a structural homology to Aplysia adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyl cyclase. This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a metabolite of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) with calcium-mobilizing activity. A complementary DNA encoding the extracellular domain of murine CD38 was constructed and expressed, and the resultant recombinant soluble CD38 was purified to homogeneity. Soluble CD38 catalyzed the formation and hydrolysis of cADPR when added to NAD+. Purified cADPR augmented the proliferative response of activated murine B cells, potentially implicating the enzymatic activity of CD38 in lymphocyte function.
ABO and Rh(D) blood group distribution was evaluated among Palestinian women in the southern area of the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Eleven per cent of women were Rh(D) negative. The review of the last 12,169 deliveries at Makassed Hospital showed that 4.8% of Rh(D)-negative mothers gave birth to Rh(D)-positive infants with haemolytic disease of the newborn. Thirty per cent of A or B infants born to O Rh(D)-positive mothers had a positive direct antiglobulin test with the presence of allo-immune A or B antibody in infant serum. ABO incompatibility was a major reason for phototherapy during the 1st week of life. Results and possibilities for prevention are discussed.
ACE inhibitors may influence the actual concentrations of the peptides angiotensin I, angiotensin II and bradykinin. Since all three peptides are able to modulate catecholamine release, a change in noradrenaline and adrenaline release should be expected when angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II) is inhibited. Furthermore, converting enzyme inhibitors may also act indirectly on sympathetic membranes affecting, for instance, the reuptake mechanism of noradrenaline. It was shown that chronic ACE inhibition did not change biosynthesis, storage or release of catecholamines. However, the reuptake of noradrenaline was slightly but significantly diminished by ramipril. Whereas Ang I exerted no facilitating action on noradrenaline, bradykinin stimulated noradrenaline release dose-dependently, almost during converting enzyme inhibition. It is concluded that bradykinin may compensate for the lack of effect of converting enzyme inhibitors on catecholamine release.
TPO is a major antigen corresponding to thyroid-microsomal autoantibodies. Anti-TPO autoantibodies are very important to diagnose autoimmune thyroid disease and to estimate its clinical course. An EIA for measuring anti-TPO autoantibodies (rhTPO-EIA) was developed using recombinant human TPO expressed in CHO cells and was compared with MCHA generally used in routine laboratory work. Sera from patients with various disorders were measured for their anti-TPO autoantibodies. Chronic thyroiditis and Graves' disease were highly positive, while thyroid cancer, adenoma, SLE, and RA were low in their positivity. The positive rate of anti-TPO autoantibodies were compatible with those of previous reports of each disorder. In the comparison between rhTPO-EIA and MCHA, the correlation coefficient was 0.486. Following absorption with thyroglobulin, sera were measured again and as a result, the correlation coefficient increased to 0.723. Therefore, MCHA was thought to be influenced in the presence of anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies. The characteristics of TPO antigen and anti-TPO autoantibodies were also summarized.
ACE inhibition has been shown to prevent neointima formation after vascular injury. However, it is not known if this effect is due to a specific inhibition of the renin angiotensin system or to another mechanism such as the accumulation of bradykinin. In order to answer this question we compared the effects of maximal effective doses of cilazapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and ciprokiren, a new renin inhibitor, in guinea pigs. Vascular injury was induced by endothelial denudation of the right carotid artery of guinea pigs treated either by saline (control group), cilazapril (30 mg/kg/day) or ciprokiren (24 mg/kg/day). Twelve days after the ballooning, the guinea pigs were sacrificed, the carotid arteries were perfused fixed and neointima formation was evaluated by quantitative morphometry. Both, ciprokiren and cilazapril prevented neointima formation to the same extent (inhibition by 42 and 49%, respectively, p < 0.05). These results suggest that, in guinea pigs, renin inhibition prevents neointima formation to a similar extent as ACE inhibition. Therefore, ACE inhibitors seem to act in this model by inhibiting the renin angiotensin system and not by other effects such as accumulation of bradykinin.
G6PD deficiency has been studied in two tribal populations: Kissan tribals of Orissa and Kannikar tribals of Nedumungad Taluk, Trivandrum, Kerala. The percentage frequencies of G6PD deficiency are 14.13% and 5.5%, respectively. The two areas have a different pattern with respect to malarial infection. The Orissa one is an endemic malaria zone, while the Kerala one is less malarious. This is very well reflected by the frequency distribution of G6PD deficiency.
ABO blood grouping of human bloodstains was performed by a sandwich ELISA using a species-specific monoclonal antibody to the amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain of human red cell membrane band 3. In a blind trial, all A, B and O bloodstains (a 1 cm long thread) and AB bloodstains (a 1.5 cm long thread) were accurately typed by this method. Even when bloodstains were contaminated by other body fluids (e.g., semen and saliva), only the ABO blood group epitopes on band 3 of the red cell membrane were detected. Thus, identification of human blood and ABO blood grouping of bloodstains which were contaminated by other body fluids could be simultaneously performed by this method.
ACE inhibitors, which till recently were used almost exclusively for treatment of cardiovascular diseases, are becoming a perspective group of drugs also in the treatment of nephropathies. It was found that they are effective in particular in the treatment of proteinuria of varying origin and have also a marked renoprotective effect and are therefore recommended to retard progression of renal failure. They reduce intraglomerular hypertension, increase glomerular filtration and the renal blood flow, and it is assumed that they can retard progression of chronic glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy. We may expect already in the near future that their therapeutic application will be substantially extended also in clinical nephrology.
TAT ([5-(3-thienyl)tetrazol-1-yl]acetic acid) is a novel aldose reductase (AR) inhibitor. It exhibited highly potent inhibition of partially purified AR from rat lens (IC50 = 2.1 x 10(-8) M), rabbit lens (IC50 = 2.3 x 10(-8) M) and human placenta (IC50 = 2.8 x 10(-8) M). On the other hand, TAT had a weak inhibitory activity against mouse liver aldehyde reductase (ALR) (IC50 = 2.4 x 10(-6) M) and poor inhibitory activity against several adenine nucleotide-requiring enzymes. Against rat lens AR, TAT exhibited an uncompetitive inhibition at a concentration of 1.0 x 10(-8) M and a mixed type inhibition at higher concentrations. TAT inhibited sorbitol accumulation in the isolated rat sciatic nerve (IC50 = 1.0 x 10(-6) M), rat lens (IC50 = 5.7 x 10(-6) M), human erythrocytes (IC50 = 2.5 x 10(-7) M), and rabbit erythrocytes (IC50 = 2.1 x 10(-7) M) incubated with high glucose concentrations. The oral administration of TAT (5-100 mg/kg/day) to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats during a 5-day treatment period decreased the sorbitol content in the sciatic nerve, dose-dependently (ED50: 8.8 mg/kg/day for the prevention and 9.0 mg/kg/day for the reversal). Moreover, TAT (2.5-40 mg/kg/day) improved the decreased motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) after a 14-day treatment period. There was a significant correlation between MNCV and sciatic nerve sorbitol content. From these results, TAT is expected to be useful for the clinical treatment of diabetic complications.
PC cell line is a highly tumorigenic insulin-independent variant from the teratoma-derived adipogenic cell line 1246. Culture medium of PC cells contains a growth promoting activity for 3T3 cells and producer cells. PC cell-derived growth factor (PCDGF) was purified to homogeneity from PC cell-conditioned medium as an apparent 88-kDa protein by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-200, and phenyl-Sepharose. Digestion with peptide-N-glycosidase F yielded an apparent 68-kDa protein component indicating that PCDGF is a glycoprotein containing about 20 kDa of carbohydrate. Partial sequence from Edman degradation of peptide fragments obtained by digestion of PCDGF with cyanogen bromide and trypsin demonstrates that PCDGF contains regions of sequence identity to that deduced from the granulin or epithelin precursor cDNAs. Granulins are small polypeptides purified from granulocyte extracts with no apparent biological functions. Epithelins are cell growth modulators purified as small molecular mass 6-kDa polypeptides from kidney extracts. The existence of a large molecular mass precursor for granulin or epithelin has been predicted based upon recently cloned cDNAs encoding these biomolecules within a 63.5-kDa protein with putative glycosylation sites. No biological activity has previously been attributed to the precursor. The present results indicate that PCDGF is a potential precursor for epithelin and/or granulin, that this 88-kDa protein is secreted and glycosylated, and that it can function as a mitogen for 3T3 cells as well as an autocrine growth factor for PC cells.
CYP1A1 gene expression is regulated by known cis- and transacting elements controlling inhibition and induction of CYP1A1 transcription. The influence of a double-stranded phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (dsODN) with sequence identical to the CYP1A1 negative regulatory element (NRE) was examined in Sprague-Dawley rats. Two strategies were employed: (i) two single-stranded complementary 25-mer ODNs that form a double-stranded ODN (ODN1) and (ii) a 54-base, self-complementary ODN which forms a dsODN hairpin (ODN2). A dsODN hairpin with scrambled NRE sequence was evaluated as a control (ODN3). Zoxazolamine paralysis times, an in vivo marker of CYP1A1 activity, were reduced from 184 +/- 18 min in saline-treated rats to 103 +/- 12.5 min 24 hr after a single 1.7-mg ODN1 iv injection. Liver microsomal EROD, an in vitro marker of CYP1A1/2 activity, was increased from 210 +/- 10 pmol in saline-treated animals to 703 +/- 73 and 623 +/- 89 pmol resorufin/mg protein/min after iv ODN1 and iv ODN2, respectively. ODN1's activity did not change PNP hydroxylation and PROD, markers of CYPs 2E1 and 2B1/2. ODN2 did not significantly change PNP but did significantly alter PROD. The ODN3 did not cause any significant changes in any assay measured. The ODN1-induced responses in ZX paralysis and EROD were observed post-iv injection, but not following ip injection of ODN1. Western blot analysis of ODN1- and HPO-treated rat liver microsomes also revealed increased in CYP1A1 protein. These data indicate double-stranded ODNs mimic the cis-acting NRE in vivo inducing CYP1A1 in the absence of other xenobiotics.
CYP2E1 is responsible for the metabolic activation of nitrosamines believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of various tumors. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a tumor thought to be linked to nitrosamine exposure. To investigate the possible role of CYP2E1 genetic polymorphisms in the etiology of this tumor, we investigated 50 histologically confirmed NPC cases from Taiwan and 50 controls matched to cases on age, sex, and residence. Samples were examined for RFLPs in the CYP2E1 gene by PCR amplification followed by digestion with DraI and RsaI. Among healthy controls, the allelic frequency of wild-type and variant forms of CYP2E1 were 79 and 21%, respectively, using DraI enzyme digestion and 82 and 18%, respectively, using RsaI enzyme digestion. As compared with individuals who were homozygous for the wild-type CYP2E1 gene, those found to be homozygous for the variant form of the gene by DraI digestion were at a 5-fold excess risk of disease (95% confidence interval = 0.95-16). Similarly, subjects homozygous for the variant form of the CYP2E1 gene by RsaI digestion were at 7.7-fold excess risk of developing NPC (95% confidence interval = 0.87-68). Individuals found to be heterozygous for the gene were at similar risk of disease compared to those homozygous for the wild-type gene. A strong association was observed between the RFLPs detected by DraI and RsaI digestion of CYP2E1; a correlation coefficient of 0.86 for controls and 0.91 for cases was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
PCK1 encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is transcriptionally regulated by two upstream activating elements. By screening for mutants that failed to derepress a UAS2PCK1-CYC1-lacZ reporter gene we isolated the new recessive derepression mutation cat5. The CAT5 gene encodes a protein of 272 amino acids showing a 42% identity to the ZC395.2 gene product of Caenorhabditis elegans whose function is unknown. Deletion of CAT5 caused a complete loss of glucose derepression affecting gluconeogenic key enzymes. Respiration, but not mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity, was also affected. CAT5 expression is 5- to 6-fold repressed by glucose, and CAT5 transcriptional activation was dependent on CAT1 (SNF1), CAT8 and CAT5 itself. The CAT5 gene is necessary for UAS1PCK1 and UAS2PCK1 protein binding since a carbon source-specific interaction was no longer detectable in cat5 mutants. Glucose derepression of gluconeogenesis depends on the active Cat1 (Snf1) protein kinase and the Cat8 zinc cluster activator. Mig1p-independent overexpression of CAT8 did not stimulate activation of gluconeogenic promoters in cat1 and in cat5 mutants. Since Cat8p multicopy expression suppresses the ethanol growth deficiency in cat1 (snf1) mutants, these results indicate that activation of Cat8p by the Cat1p (Snf1p) kinase and the Cat5p protein might be necessary for release from glucose repression.
CD36 is an integral membrane glycoprotein expressed by several cell types, including endothelial cells of the microvasculature, erythrocytes, platelets, and monocytes. In the monocytic lineage, CD36 is expressed during the late stages of differentiation in the bone marrow, in circulating monocytes, and in some tissue resident macrophages, and it is thought to mediate the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and the endocytic uptake of modified lipoproteins. Here we analyze the synthesis, processing, and intracellular transport of CD36 in U937 and THP-1, two human cell lines representing different stages of monocytic maturation. In both cell lines, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induces the expression of CD36. A 74-kDa intracellular precursor is first synthesized that has the hallmarks of a resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. The precursor protein is later processed into a mature form of 90-105 kDa which is transported to the cell surface. The kinetics of processing differ significantly in U937 and THP-1. These differences are specific for the CD36, as two unrelated proteins (CD11b and CD45R) are processed and transported to the surface at similar rates in the two cell lines. A 33-kDa endoglycosidase H-sensitive glycoprotein specifically associates with the 74-kDa precursor. Coprecipitation of gp33 correlates with slow processing of CD36 precursor, suggesting that gp33 may play a role in regulating the intracellular transport of CD36, during monocyte maturation.
CD38 is a lymphocyte differentiation antigen which is involved in the cyclic ADP-ribose-mediated second messenger system. We provide immunochemical and immunohistochemical evidence for the expression of CD38 in the adult human brain. We used six polyclonal antibodies against synthetic CD38 polypeptides, in addition to four monoclonal antibodies already available. Brain CD38 was detectable by Western blotting after immunoaffinity purification of the brain extracts. Immunoperoxidase staining localized CD38 immunoreactivity to the perikarya and dendrites of many neurons, such as the cerebellar Purkinje cells, implying that CD38 is involved in the signal transduction within the central nervous system neurons.
CYP3A7 is a major form of cytochrome P450 in human fetal livers. To elucidate toxicological significance of CYP3A7 in fetal livers, CYP3A7 cDNA was introduced into Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells. Transformants carrying the CYP3A7 gene were more sensitive to mycotoxins than parental CHL cells. In additional studies, we established a hepatocyte cell line from CYP3A7-transgenic/p53-knockout mice. In hepatocyte cells from CYP3A7-transgenic/p53-knockout mice, CYP3A7 mRNA was expressed and the catalytic activity of CYP3A7 protein was detected. The cells are expected to show cytotoxicity to mycotoxins and teratogens. These cell lines provide a valuable panel for studying the fetal toxicities of chemicals in humans.
CYP3A4 represents the most important form of human cytochrome P450 active in drug metabolism. Reconstitution of this enzyme has in the past been a major problem. Using purified cDNA-expressed CYP3A4 incorporated into membranous vesicles made from microsomal phospholipids, rates of nifedipine and testosterone oxidation of about 60 nmol/nmol P450/min were achieved, whereas similar reconstitution into dilauroyl-phosphatidylcholine micelles was unsuccessful. A higher Vmax for nifedipine oxidation was obtained in negatively charged vesicles as compared to neutral membranes, whereas the membrane charge did not influence the Km. It is concluded that the native function of CYP3A4 requires a negatively charged microsomal membrane.
CD38 is a cell surface molecule widely used as a marker for immature and activated lymphocytes. It has been recently shown that CD38 displays three enzymatic activities: hydrolysis of NAD+ to ADP-ribose, synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose from NAD+, and hydrolysis of cyclic ADP-ribose to ADP-ribose. Thus, CD38 plays a key role in the synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose, a calcium-mobilizing compound. We investigate here the expression and cellular localization of CD38 in human platelets using a specific monoclonal antibody. Results showed that CD38 is expressed by human platelet membranes. Moreover, we show that platelet CD38 possesses NAD glycohydrolase, ADP-ribose cyclase, and cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase activities. This finding indicates that the calcium-mobilizing agent cyclic ADP-ribose can be synthetized by human platelets and raises the question about the possible role of CD38 expression and enzymatic activities in the signal transduction pathways leading to platelet activation.
CD36 is a cell surface glycoprotein composed of a single polypeptide chain, which interacts with thrombospondin, collagens type I and IV, oxidized low density lipoprotein, fatty acids, anionic phospholipids, and erythrocytes parasitized with Plasmodium falciparum. Its expression is restricted to a few cell types, including monocyte/macrophages. In these cells, CD36 is involved in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, and foam cell formation by uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein. To study the molecular mechanisms that control the transcription of the CD36 gene in monocytic cells we have isolated and analyzed the CD36 promoter. Transient expression experiments of 5'-deletion fragments of the CD36 promoter coupled to luciferase demonstrated that as few as 158 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site were sufficient to direct the monocyte-specific transcription of the reporter gene. Within the above region, the fragment spanning nucleotides -158 to -90 was required for optimal transcription in monocytic cells. Biochemical analysis of the region -158/-90 revealed a binding site for transcription factors of the polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2/core-binding factor (PEBP2/CBF) family at position -103. Disruption of the PEBP2/CBF site markedly diminished the role of the PEBP2/CBF factors in the constitutive transcription of the CD36 gene. The involvement of members of the PEBP2/CBF family in chromosome translocations associated with acute myeloid leukemia, and in the transcriptional regulation of the myeloid-specific genes encoding for myeloperoxidase, elastase, and the colony-stimulating factor receptor, highlights the relevance of the regulation of the CD36 gene promoter in monocytic cells by members of the PEBP2/CBF family.
CD36 is an 88-kD integral membrane glycoprotein expressed on monocytes, platelets, and certain microvascular endothelium serving distinct cellular functions both as an adhesive receptor for thrombospondin, collagen, and Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes, and as a scavenger receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein and apoptotic neutrophils. In this study, we examined the expression of CD36 during in vitro differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes into culture-derived macrophages. Steady-state mRNA levels of CD36 showed a transient eightfold increase during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, peaking at the early macrophage stage (days 3 or 4 in culture), following a gradual decrease back to baseline levels by the mature macrophage stage (days 7 or 8 in culture). Immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies to CD36 supported this transient, yet significant (8- to 10-fold) increase in total protein levels of CD36. The increased CD36 protein was observed at the plasma membrane, whereas an intracellular pool of CD36 was also detected from day 2 to day 6 in culture through indirect immunofluorescence. A concomitant twofold increase in the cells' ability to bind 125I-thrombospondin at the early macrophage stage (day 4) verified the functional competency of the plasma membrane localized CD36, and supported the presence of an intracellular pool of CD36. The in vitro differentiated macrophages as well as alveolar macrophages remained responsive to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), a known transcriptional regulator of monocyte CD36. The M-CSF-induced macrophages resulted in enhanced foam cell formation, which was inhibitable with monoclonal antibodies to CD36. Thus, the transient expression of CD36 during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, and the ability of M-CSF to maintain macrophage CD36 at elevated levels, may serve as a critical process in dictating the functional activity of CD36 during inflammatory responses and atherogenesis.
CYP3A7 is a cytochrome P450 isozyme expressed prenatally in humans. Six lines of mice transgenic for human CYP3A7 were established by microinjecting a CYP3A7 cDNA downstream of a mouse metallothionein-1 promoter gene into the male pronucleus of fertilized mouse oocytes. The inserted CYP3A7 transgene was expressed at a mRNA level in a variety of tissues including the liver, kidney, lung, spleen, testis, small intestine, thymus, brain, skin, and heart of adult mice. The protein expression of the transgene was also detected in the liver and testis of line M10 mice. A significantly higher level of total testosterone in the serum was found in line M10 male mice. In addition, this transgenic line exhibited weight increases in the liver, kidney, and uterus but a decrease in the testis (P < 0.01). The transcript of the integrated CYP3A7 gene possessed the ability to activate aflatoxin B1 in Ames test in which the his+ revertants of Salmonella typhimurium TA100 per plate were significantly higher (P < 0.01) when liver microsomes of line M10 transgenic mice were used. This result demonstrates that the CYP3A7 gene has been integrated into the mouse genome and translated into a catalytically active enzyme. These transgenic mice are expected to give useful information for studies on fetal toxicities in humans.
CFTR shares structural homology with the ABC transporter superfamily of proteins which hydrolyze ATP to effect the transport of compounds across cell membranes. Some superfamily members are characterized as P-type ATPases because ATP-dependent transport is sensitive to the presence of vanadate. It has been widely postulated that CFTR hydrolyzes ATP to gate its chloride channel. However, direct evidence of CFTR hydrolytic activity in channel gating is lacking and existing circumstantial evidence is contradictory. Therefore, we evaluated CFTR chloride channel activity under conditions known to inhibit the activity of ATPases; i.e., in the absence of divalent cations and in the presence of a variety of ATPase inhibitors. Removal of the cytosolic cofactor, Mg2+, reduced both the opening and closing rates of CFTR suggesting that Mg2+ plays a modulatory role in channel gating. However, channels continued to both open and close showing that Mg2+ is not an absolute requirement for channel activity. The nonselective P-type ATPase inhibitor, vanadate, did not alter the gating of CFTR when used at concentrations which completely inhibit the activity of other ABC transporters (1 mM). Higher concentrations of vanadate (10 mM) blocked the closing of CFTR, but did not affect the opening of the channel. As expected, more selective P-type (Sch28080, ouabain), V-type (bafilomycin A1, SCN-) and F-type (oligomycin) ATPase inhibitors did not affect either the opening or closing of CFTR. Thus, CFTR does not share a pharmacological inhibition profile with other ATPases and channel gating occurs in the apparent absence of hydrolysis, although with altered kinetics. Vanadate inhibition of channel closure might suggest that a hydrolytic step is involved although the requirement for a high concentration raises the possibility of previously uncharacterized effects of this compound. Most conservatively, the requirement for high concentrations of vanadate demonstrates that the binding site for this transition state analogue is considerably different than that of other ABC transporters.
CFTR is a chloride channel that is required for fluid secretion and salt absorption in many exocrine epithelia. Mutations in CFTR cause cystic fibrosis. CFTR expression influences some ion channels, but the range of channels influenced, the mechanism of the interaction and the significance for cystic fibrosis are not known. Possible interactions between CFTR and other ion channels were studied in C127 mouse mammary epithelial cell lines stably transfected with CFTR, delta F508-CFTR, or vector. Cell lines were compared quantitatively using an 125I efflux assay and qualitatively using whole-cell patch-clamp recording. As expected, 125I efflux was significantly increased by forskolin only in the CFTR line, and forskolin-stimulated whole-cell currents were time- and voltage independent. All three lines responded to hypotonic challenge with large 125I efflux responses of equivalent magnitude, and whole-cell currents were outwardly rectified and inactivated at positive voltages. Unexpectedly, basal 125I efflux was significantly smaller in the delta F508-CFTR cell line than in either the CFTR or control cell lines (P < 0.0001), and the magnitude of the efflux response to ionomycin was largest in the vector cell line and smallest in the cell line expressing delta F508-CFTR (P < 0.01). Whole-cell responses to ionomycin had a linear instantaneous I-V relation and activated at depolarizing voltages. Forskolin responses showed simple summation with responses to ionomycin or hypotonic challenge. Thus, we found no evidence for interactions between CFTR and the channels responsible for swelling-mediated responses. Differences were found in basal and ionomycin-stimulated efflux, but these may arise from variations in the clonally selected cell lines that are unrelated to CFTR expression.
PC (di-alpha-phosphatidylcholine) contents in the seeds of Astragalus chinensis were determined by TLC-scanning. These data can be used to study the phospholipids in Astragalus chinensis and evaluate its quality. This method is simple, sensitive and has better reproducibility, higher recoveries and steadiness in operation.
ABO and Rh(o)(D) blood groups were determined in 3813 males and females affiliated with the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) who are residents of the Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA) in northeastern Mexico. They were selected by their monophyletic or polyphyletic surnames. The ABO and Rh(o)(D) blood group phenotypes and gene frequencies were determined and based upon these, the risk of incompatibilities was estimated for both marriages (MI) and maternal-fetal incompatibility (MFI). These were compared with those estimated for other populations of residents in the MMA, and in other locations in Mexico, as well as with the two most important ancestral populations, Spanish and Tlaxcaltecan Mexican Indians, with the hypothesis that the percent of risk of ABO and Rh(o)(D) MI and MFI are greater in the population with monophyletic surnames than those with polyphyletic surnames. It was found that for persons with monophyletic and polyphyletic surnames, as well as for the other populations in the MMA and other places in Mexico, their ABO and Rho(D) MI and MFI percent of risk are intermediate to the ones estimated for their ancestry. The percentages of MI and MFI are higher for the persons with monophyletic than for the ones with polyphyletic surnames, other populations from the MMA and those from other locations in Mexico. The risks are higher when the similarity with Spanish increases and are lower when their similarities with the Mexican Indians increase.
CD36 is an 88-kD integral membrane protein expressed on platelets, monocytes, macrophages, certain microvascular endothelia, and retinal pigment epithelium. It functions as an adhesive receptor for thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), collagen, and malaria-infected erythrocytes and as a scavenger receptor for oxidized LDL and photoreceptor outer segments. The CD36-TSP-1 interaction plays a role in cell adhesion and the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages. Because of the potential importance of the CD36-TSP-1 interaction in mediating atherogenic and inflammatory processes, we studied their expression in human peripheral blood monocytes exposed to soluble mediators known to regulate inflammation and atherogenesis. RNase protection assays showed 6- to 12-fold increases in CD36 mRNA in response to interleukin-4, monocyte colony-stimulating factor, and phorbol myristate acetate, while lipopolysaccharide and dexamethasone strongly downregulated CD36 mRNA. The downregulation of CD36 mRNA was associated with the disappearance of surface expression of CD36 antigen and loss of TSP-1 surface-binding capacity. Upregulation of CD36 mRNA was associated with a modest increase in surface antigen expression and a larger expansion of an intracellular pool of CD36. As with CD36, monocytes treated with monocyte colony-stimulating factor showed a rapid increase in TSP-1 mRNA expression. Moreover, while dexamethasone treatment decreased CD36 expression, it resulted in a rapid increase in TSP-1 mRNA, and while PMA increased CD36 mRNA, it rapidly decreased TSP-1 expression. Interferon gamma, which had no effect on CD36 mRNA, rapidly increased steady-state TSP-1 mRNA. Thus, expression of both CD36 and its ligand TSP-1 is regulated by soluble mediators, although certain mediators induce concordant changes and others discordant changes.
CD36 is a multifunctional integral-membrane glycoprotein that acts as a receptor for thrombospondin, collagen, long-chain fatty acids, and oxidized LDL. Platelet CD36 deficiency can be divided into two groups. In type I, neither platelets nor monocytes/macrophages express CD36; in type II, monocytes/macrophages express CD36 but platelets do not. Two known mutations cause CD36 deficiency, ie, a 478C-->T substitution in codon 90 (proline90-->serine) and a dinucleotide deletion at nucleotide 539 in codon 110. In this study we investigated a type I Japanese subject (A.T.) and identified a new mutation, a single nucleotide insertion at nucleotide 1159 in codon 317. This mutation leads to a frameshift and the appearance of a premature stop codon. CD36 gene analysis indicated that A.T. was a compound heterozygote for a dinucleotide deletion at nucleotide 539 and the single nucleotide insertion at nucleotide 1159. RNase protection studies suggested that the new mutation as well as the dinucleotide deletion led to a marked reduction in the level of CD36 mRNA in her macrophages. However, the new mutation could be detected in macrophage but not platelet CD36 mRNA. These data suggest that the allele having the single nucleotide insertion in this subject has an additional abnormality that results in the absence of the mutated CD36 mRNA in platelets.
CYP1A1 is responsible for the metabolic activation of benzo(a)pyrene in cigarette smoke, and high susceptibility to smoking-related lung cancer has been associated with the MspI polymorphism of the CYP1A1 gene. Individuals with a susceptible CYP1A1 genotype have been found to be at remarkably high risk when the genotype is combined with a deficient Mu-class glutathione S-transferase (GSTM1) genotype. In this study, we investigated the relationship between germ line polymorphisms of these genes and clinical characteristics or survival rates in 232 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Statistical analysis revealed a significant association (P < 0.05) of the MspI polymorphism of the CYP1A1 gene with histological type, performance status (general conditions of patients), and the extent of the primary tumor (T-factor). On the other hand, the GSTM1 polymorphism was significantly associated with performance status, the extent of regional lymph node metastasis (N-factor), and the extent of distant metastasis (M-factor). NSCLC patients with at least one susceptible allele of the MspI polymorphism of the CYP1A1 gene [heterozygous genotype B or a rare homozygous genotype C; n = 131; median survival time (MST) = 24.2 months] were associated with a shortened survival compared with those with nonsusceptible homozygous alleles (genotype A; n = 101; MST = 65.2 months; P = 0.005 by log-rank test). Smokers with susceptible genotypes (n = 104; MST = 18.2 months) were markedly associated with a shortened survival compared with those with genotype A (n = 76; MST = 69.2 months; P = 0.024); such an association was not found among nonsmokers by genotypes. Genotype-dependent survival was also observed in patients at an advanced stage of disease (P = 0.010), but not in those at an early stage of disease (P = 0.382). Patients with the susceptible CYP1A1 genotype had remarkably shortened survivals when the genotype was combined with a deficient genotype GSTM1(-) (P = 0.017; degree of freedom = 3). Multivariate analysis by the Cox proportional hazards model also revealed that the CYP1A1 polymorphism was an independent prognostic factor in patients at a nonresectable advanced stage of NSCLC (P = 0.005; hazard ratio = 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-3.17).
CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampus die while CA3 neurons survive after transient ischemia. The imbalance of excitation and inhibition may contribute to this selective vulnerability. The purpose of this study was to examine the morphological basis of the above hypothesis.
ACP1 (low molecular weight acid phosphatase) genetic polymorphism has been studied in 173 women with a history of two or more consecutive spontaneous abortions and in 1508 control subjects, including 482 normal pregnant women. The proportion of carriers of ACP1*C allele (*A/ *C, *B/*C) in women with a history of repeated spontaneous abortion is lower than in normal pregnant women and other control groups. Women with repeated spontaneous abortion show a specific decrease of ACP1 S isoform concentration as compared to normal pregnant women. The other component of ACP1 activity, the F isoform, does not show a significant difference between the two groups. The data suggest that women with ACP1 genotypes showing a high concentration of S isoform are relatively 'protected' against spontaneous abortion. Preliminary analysis of a sample of 352 normal puerperae along with their newborn babies supports this hypothesis.
DBT is a comprehensive, behaviorally oriented treatment designed for highly dysfunctional individuals meeting criteria for BPD. Many of these criteria are characteristic of drug abusers, and some of the problems encountered in treatment of drug abusers, especially when various treatments are combined, are similar. The basic armamentarium of the DBT therapist is the balancing of validation and acceptance treatment strategies with problem-solving procedures, including contingency management, exposure-based procedures, cognitive modification, and skills training. In addition, a number of specific strategies have been woven together to enhance compliance and to reduce the staff splitting that is so frequent with this population. Those described in this chapter include orienting and commitment strategies and the focus in DBT on reducing therapy-interfering behavior and on consultation with the client rather than with the client's network.
ABO blood groups; serum proteins, including transferring (Tf), group-specific component (Gc), proteinase inhibitor (PI), and haptoglobin (Hp); and erythrocytic enzymes, including acid phosphatase (ACP1) and phosphoglucomutase (PGM1), were studied in two ethnic groups from the Marii EI Republic-Highland and Meadow Mari. The size of populations examined were 111 and 140 individuals, respectively. Data on frequency distribution of phenotypes and genes are reported, and the two populations are compared with respect to allelic frequency. To assess the subdivision of the population, GST was used. Its value was 0.0041.
G6PD activity, estimated in 37 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) prior to therapy was found to be significantly decreased in 78.37% of the patients with ALL while it was normal in other patients. Variation in G6PD was found to be dependent on the percentage of myelocytes. Correlation analysis of leukocyte G6PD activity with karyotype indicated that patients with normal karyotype with normal G6PD activity had good prognosis while those with abnormal G6PD with abnormal karyotype had poor prognosis. Subjects with normal karyotype and abnormal G6PD and vice versa had intermediate prognosis. Thus the results clearly indicate that leukocyte G6PD may be used as a diagnostic and prognostic tool.
TAT protein is an essential regulatory protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Inhibition of TAT activity blocks the virus cycle, and a drug that blocks TAT is one of the possibilities to cure AIDS. Circular dichroism (CD) was measured for TAT peptides covering the TAT sequence with overlaps. The CD spectrum of each peptide was measured in different solvents to evaluate the ability of each TAT region to form different secondary structures. The most variation or conformational heterogeneity is observed with the two regions adjacent to the TAT basic region. CD data show that the basic region can adopt an extended structure in a full TAT protein, which is not the case for the isolated peptide. TAT sequences from the different HIV-1 isolates were analyzed, and the results showed that the sequences could be gathered into six groups. Molecular modeling was done on the various isolates based on a TAT structure from two-dimensional NMR. After minimization and dynamic steps, the modeled three-dimensional structures were compared. The results showed structural variations of the TAT protein as a function of the HIV-1 isolates. These structural variations were mainly in the two regions adjacent to the basic region, confirming the conformational heterogeneity indicated by the CD measurements. Furthermore, Chou-Fasman analysis shows significant changes in propensities for each secondary structure only for regions III and V. This conformational heterogeneity should be essential for TAT activity and points out that regions III and V are a poor potential target to design a TAT ligand. We propose a target involving TAT structurally conserved regions, accessible whatever the size of the TAT C terminus.
CYP2E1 is involved in the activation of various carcinogens, including N-nitrosamines, which are believed to be important in human carcinogenesis. Humans exhibit wide interindividual variability in levels of CYP2E1 mRNA and protein, which might explain interindividual differences in susceptibility to carcinogens activated by CYP2E1. Such variability could be due either to genetic polymorphisms observed in the CYP2E1 gene (Rsa I in the 5'-flanking region, Dra I in intron 6 and Taq I in intron 7) or to varying inducibility by xenobiotics. The aim of the present study was to establish whether, in a Caucasian population (n = 93), there existed a relationship between allelic forms of the CYP2E1 gene and the phenotype determined in vitro by hepatic ability to 6-hydroxylate chlorzoxazone. Rates of chlorzoxazone-6-hydroxylation were significantly correlated with levels of immunochemically measured CYP2E1 (p < 0.001). CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2D6, 3A4 and 3A5 did not appear to be significantly involved in chlorzoxazone metabolism, whereas the participation of CYP1A1 could not be excluded. Frequencies of the rare alleles for the three polymorphism sites were 2.2% for RsaI, 7.5% for DraI and 8.5% for TaqI. Despite substantial interindividual variations in chlorzoxazone hydroxylase activity, no relationship between any of the three polymorphisms and CYP2E1 activity was established. Therefore, in humans, interindividual variability in CYP2E1 levels is probably due to differing induction levels as a result of environmental factors, or to genetic factors other than those studied in this work.
TH is a tetrahydrobiopterin-requiring, iron-containing monooxygenase. It catalyses the conversion of L-tyrosine to L-dopa, which is the first, rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of catecholamines (dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline), the central and sympathetic neurotransmitters and adrenomedullary hormones. The cofactor of TH is tetrahydrobiopterin, which is synthesized from GTP in three steps. The TH gene consists of 14 exons only in humans and 13 exons in animals. Human TH exists in four isoforms (hTH1-4) that are produced by alternative mRNA splicing from a single gene. A single mRNA and protein corresponding to hTH1 exists in non-primates. Monkey TH exists in two isoforms, corresponding to hTH1 and hTH2. TH activity is regulated in the short term by feedback inhibition of catecholamines in competition with tetrahydrobiopterin, and by activation and deactivation due to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, mainly at Ser-19 and Ser-40 of hTH1. The multiple TH isoforms in humans and monkeys have additional phosphorylation, resulting in more subtle regulation. In long-term regulation under stress conditions, TH protein is induced. CRE and AP1 in the 5' flanking region of the TH gene may be the main functional elements for TH gene expression. TH may be closely related to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, such as dystonia and Parkinson's disease, psychiatric diseases, such as affective disorders and schizophrenia, as well as cardiovascular diseases. The TH gene may prove useful in gene therapy to compensate for decreased levels of catecholamines in neurological diseases, for example, for supplementation of dopamine in Parkinson's disease.
ACE inhibitors have the potential to affect myocardial ischaemia in patients with asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction and ischaemic cardiomyopathy after long-term treatment. However, anti-ischaemic effects are virtually absent in stable effort angina during short-term therapy, which suggests different mechanisms of action in different patient subtypes. Long-term treatment in left ventricular dysfunction may lead to a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand and ischaemia as a result of ventricular remodelling, possibly supported by structural coronary vascular effects, i.e., an improved endothelial function and vasodilator capacity. An alternative mechanism by which ACE inhibitors may affect ischaemia, is through modulation of ischaemia-induced neurohormonal activation and subsequent systemic vasoconstriction. Depending on the severity of ischaemia, pronounced catecholamine activation and stimulation of the circulating renin-angiotensin system occur, accompanied by systemic vasoconstriction and an increase in afterload. These changes are marked in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Moreover, a change from net catecholamine release to uptake in the ischaemic area is observed. Although the clinical significance of the latter observation is still unclear, sympathetic activation may lead to coronary vasoconstriction in stenotic areas where normal endothelium-dependent coronary vasodilatation has become impaired. In the resting patient, enalaprilat and perindoprilat significantly reduce myocardial ischaemia, not by a direct effect on the oxygen supply-demand ratio, but through modulation of neurohormonal activation, in particular of sympathetic activation during ischaemia, and, subsequently, by preventing systemic vasoconstriction. These effects are pronounced in left ventricular dysfunction, at least where perindoprilat is concerned. The possibility that ACE inhibitors improve endothelial function in concert with their modulating effects on ischaemia-induced neurohormonal activation and hence influence the occurrence of myocardial ischemia during long-term treatment needs further evaluation.
ABO is clinically the most important blood group system in transfusion medicine and includes many variant phenotypes. To understand the molecular genetic basis of this polymorphic system, we have analyzed genomic DNAs obtained from Japanese individuals possessing variant ABO phenotypes including A2, Ax, Ael, cis-AB, Bx, and Bel. By polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and nucleotide sequence analyses, we identified 11 different alleles. These alleles had nucleotide sequences different from those of the previously described 13 different alleles responsible for the common ABO phenotypes. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the alleles responsible for those variant phenotypes showed that the amino acid residues at position 266 and 268 may be crucial for transferase specificity, whereas those at positions 214, 216, 223, 291, and 352 may be critical for the activity level. Nine of the 11 alleles, responsible for the A2, Ax, Ael, cis-AB, Bx, and Bel phenotypes, were presumed to be generated from common ABO alleles by single nucleotide mutations such as nonsynonymous substitution, deletion, or insertion. Two other alleles, responsible for the A2 and Ael phenotypes, may have originated by recombination, gene conversionlike events or accumulation of nucleotide substitutions. Our data indicate that different alleles could cause the same ABO variant phenotypes, and that these alleles do not necessarily belong to a single evolutionary lineage.
ACE inhibitors improve reperfusion function in several animal models. We tested the hypothesis that ACE inhibitor-induced coronary protection and inhibition of reperfusion arrhythmias are mediated by suppression of cardiac endothelin-1 (ET-1) secretion and action.
CFTR alleles containing two mutations have been very rarely found in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. They provide an opportunity to study the effect of two in cis-interacting gene defects on gene expression. Here, we describe a three-generation CF family with a complex CFTR allele that has not been previously described, containing the missense mutation R334W in exon 7 and the nonsense mutation R1158X in exon 19. Lymphocyte RNA analysis showed that (1) the mRNA corresponding to the complex allele is present although at markedly reduced levels; and (2) the nonsense mutation does not lead to detectable skipping of exon 19. The clinical picture of the patients with the genotype R334W-R1158X/delta F508 is characterized by pancreatic sufficiency and an atypical course of the disease.
PGM1 polymorphism in five Han subpopulations in China was investigated by polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing. The frequency of PGM1*1A was 0.6256 for Xi'an Han, 0.5982 for Zhengzhou Han, 0.6429 for Huhhot Han, 0.6232 for Lanzhou Han, and 0.6000 for Hakka in Guangdong Province. There was a north to south cline of PGM1*1A frequency.
ACE inhibitors effectively reduce systemic vascular resistance in patients with hypertension, heart failure or chronic renal disease. This antihypertensive efficacy probably accounts for an important part of their long term renoprotective effects in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal disease. The renal mechanisms underlying the renal adverse effects of ACE inhibitors--intrarenal efferent vasodilation with a consequent fall in filtration pressure--are held to be involved in their renoprotective effects as well. The fall in filtration pressure presumably contributes to the antiproteinuric effect as well as to long term renoprotection. The former is suggested by the positive correlation between the fall in filtration fraction and the reduction in proteinuria found during ACE inhibition. The latter is suggested by the correlation between the (slight) reduction in glomerular filtration rate at onset of therapy and a more favourable course of renal function in the long term. Such a fall in filtration rate at the onset of ACE inhibitor treatment is reversible after withdrawal, and can be considered the trade-off for long term renal protection in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic chronic renal disease. In conditions in which glomerular filtration is critically dependent on angiotensin II-mediated efferent vascular tone (such as a post-stenotic kidney, or patients with heart failure and severe depletion of circulating volume), ACE inhibition can induce acute renal failure, which is reversible after withdrawal of the drug. Systemic and renal haemodynamic effects of ACE inhibition, both beneficial and adverse, are potentiated by sodium depletion. Consequently, sodium repletion contributes to the restoration of renal function in patients with ACE inhibitor-induced acute renal failure. Our the other hand, co-treatment with diuretics and sodium restriction can improve therapeutic efficacy in patients in whom the therapeutic response of blood pressure or proteinuria is insufficient. Patients at the greatest risk for renal adverse effects (those with heart failure, diabetes mellitus and/or chronic renal failure) also can expect the greatest benefit. Therefore, ACE inhibitors should not be withheld in these patients, but dosages should be carefully titrated, with monitoring of renal function and serum potassium levels.
MIP family proteins with conserved 6 transmembrane domains can be divided into two groups according to their primary sequences. The CHIP group with deletions is predominant in plant and animal kingdom, and functions primarily as water channels. The GLP group without deletions is minor group with limited prevalence and functions as glycerol transporters. Both prototypes are present in bacteria and evolved separately. CHIP group is further divided into three groups: tonoplast aquaporins, plasma membrane aquaporins, and peribacterial nodulins. The recognition of groups in MIP family will facilitate the search for functional domains and deepen our understanding of this ancient protein family.
CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved as an orphan receptor in many physiological processes of lymphocytes. It is also a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes at its ectocellular domain the synthesis from NAD+ (cyclase) and the hydrolysis (hydrolase) of the calcium-mobilizing metabolite cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR). A still unexplained paradox concerns the relationship between ectocellular localization of CD38 and intracellular calcium-releasing activity of its intermediate product cADPR. Incubation of CD38+ human Namalwa B cells with external NAD+ elicited extensive membrane down-regulation of CD38 and its internalization in non-clathrin-coated vesicles. Since the internalized CD38 was demonstrated to be enzymatically active, this NAD+-dependent process is a hitherto unrecognized means for shifting cADPR metabolism from the cell surface to the intracellular environment.
G6PD deficiency is the most common human enzymopathy and affects 200 million people worldwide. To date more than 400 biochemical variants and at least 60 different point mutations in the G6PD locus have been discovered. In Malaysia the overall incidence of G6PD deficiency among males is 3.1%, being more prevalent among the Chinese and Malays and less common among the Indians. As part of our initial effort to characterise G6PD deficiency in the Malaysian population, we investigated 18 G6PD deficient Chinese male neonates for the G6PD mutation G-->T at nt 1376, a common mutation seen among the Chinese in Taiwan and mainland China. The mutation was detected by a PCR-based technique using primers that artificially create a site for restriction enzyme Xho I. We found 61% (11 out of 18) of the Chinese G6PD deficient male neonates positive for this mutation. Study of enzyme electrophoretic mobility in 7 of the cases positive for this mutation revealed three different patterns of mobility. 107% (5 out of 7), 103% (1 out of 7) and 100% (1 out of 7). This study shows that mutation G-->T at nt 1376 is a common allele causing G6PD deficiency in Malaysians of Chinese origin. The finding of different patterns of electrophoretic mobility among the 7 cases positive for 1376 G-->T mutation supports the notion that diverse biochemical variants may share the same mutation.
ABO blood groups were determined by the mutagenically separated polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR). The products from two sets of PCR reactions using the same program for the nucleotides at positions 261 and 703 from cDNA at the ABO locus were used to distinguish A, B and O alleles. Two forward mutagenic allele-specific primers of different lengths for the ABO polymorphic site were paired with the same reverse primer in each PCR reaction. The 216 bp fragment of the PCR products for the 261th nucleotide was A or B allele-specific and the 195 bp fragment was O allele-specific. The 126 bp fragment of the PCR products for the 703th nucleotide was B allele-specific and the 106 bp fragment was A or O allele-specific. The ABO genotypes were determined by the intersection of the predicted alleles from these two PCR reactions. The PCR products were obtained using 10 ng of DNA in 50 microL of PCR reaction mixture, and electrophoresed in 4% agarose gel. In this study, 265 ABO-phenotype known samples (A: 31, B: 48, AB: 6 and O: 180) in Chinese were used. The results of ABO genotypes were AA: 1, AO: 30, BB: 2, BO: 46, AB: 6 and OO: 180. These results were confirmed by the PCR-RFLP ABO genotyping method. This technique is a simple, rapid, and reliable method for ABO genotyping.
ABO genotyping was carried out using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method on the dried remains of nine human mummies which had been discovered at Taklamakan desert in 1912. In all the nine mummies, ABO genotype could be determined as BO type, and ABO phenotype of the eight mummies with hair specimen could be revealed as B type using absorption-elution method. These results mean that ABO phenotype estimated from its genotype by PCR-RFLP was consistent with that by absorption-elution method in all of the eight cases examined. And in the other one child mummy, ABO phenotype could not be examined because of no hair specimen. Although it is impossible to assess the allele frequency of ABO blood group system in the populations having lived in Gao Chang at that time, the present study shows a possibility of ABO genotyping from ancient human remains.
PEMT and CT activities were reciprocally regulated during the perinatal period. Consistently, PEMT2 expression was undetectable before birth when CT was highly expressed. Surprisingly, PEMT2 was relatively highly expressed at birth when the cell division and CT expression were still high. During development liver cell growth was associated with enhanced levels in the activity of beta, zeta and, particularly, alpha PKC. The activity of delta PKC was lower in foetal, higher in the newborn and again slightly lower than adult liver 10 days after birth. These data show that CT expression and alpha, beta and zeta PKC activities are positively, whereas PEMT2 expression and delta PKC activity are negatively associated with the liver cell division during development.
ACE inhibitors have been proven to be effective in the reduction of ischemia/reperfusion damage after myocardial ischemia. In an attempt to investigate this effect in a model of syngeneic liver transplantation in the rat, we compared a control group with an ACE inhibitor treatment group, in which enalapril was given i.v. before and during reperfusion. By means of in vivo microscopy, sinusoidal perfusion rate, permanent leukocyte sticking in sinusoids and postsinusoidal venules, and leukocyte rolling in postsinusoidal venules were assessed. Liver function was evaluated by measuring bile output. The sinusoidal perfusion rate was significantly improved by enalapril treatment. Leukocyte sticking in both sinusoids and postsinusoidal venules was found to be remarkably reduced in enalapril-treated animals; the fraction of rolling leukocytes remained unchanged. Bile output was increased in enalapril-treated animals. These results demonstrated, in a model of rat liver transplantation, that ACE inhibition by enalapril is effective in reducing hepatic ischemia/reperfusion damage as assessed by the leukocyte-endothelium interaction using in vivo microscopy and postreperfusion bile production.
CD38 is a 45 KD glycoprotein which is mainly expressed on early lymphoid progenitors and plasma cells. Role and function of CD38 on thymocytes and plasma cells has not yet been elucidated. By cross-linking of CD38 molecules using a specific monoclonal antibody on thymocytes and a neoplastic T cell line (Jurkat), it was shown that percentage of HLA-DR and IL-2R molecules is significantly upregulated. Moreover, CD11a and CD18 were among two adhesion molecules which showed a sharp increase in expression, whereas no changes on expression of CD11b, CD44 and CD54 were detected. Spontaneous proliferation of Jurkat cell line after addition of different concentrations of CD38 monoclonal antibody was unchanged.
ACE inhibitors potentiate kinin-nitric oxide (NO)-dependent coronary vascular dilation, and NO can modulate myocardial oxygen consumption. Whether ACE inhibitors also affect myocardial O2 consumption has not been established.
CFTR transcripts have been qualitatively and quantitatively analysed in nasal epithelial and vas deferens cells by means of reverse transcription PCR. Alternative splicing of exon 9, which is known to occur in nasal epithelial cells, also occurred in vas deferens cells. The extent of this alternative splicing was determined by the allele present at the Tn locus at the end of intron 8 of the CFTR gene. However, the proportion of transcripts lacking exon 9 sequences was increased in vas deferens cells compared with nasal epithelial cells, independent of the Tn genotype. We postulate that this tissue specific difference in the proportion of CFTR transcripts lacking exon 9 sequences could contribute to the tissue specific disease phenotype observed in individuals with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens.
CYP2C9 is involved in the metabolism of warfarin and a wide array of other therapeutic agents. It also appears to play a role, along with other cytochrome P450 enzymes, in the metabolism of benzo[a]pyrene, a carcinogen in tobacco smoke. A relatively common allelic variant (termed R144C, Cys144 or more recently CYP2C9*2) has been described that results in the substitution of cysteine for arginine at residue 144 and appears to reduce enzyme activity. We therefore examined the possible association between the presence of the CYP2C9*2 variant allele and risk of lung cancer using peripheral blood DNA from 329 incident cases of lung cancer (152 African-American and 177 Caucasian) and 700 (239 African-American and 461 Caucasian) population controls in Los Angeles County, California. Among the population controls the frequency of the CYP2C9*2 variant allele was lower (p = 0.00002) among African-Americans (0.036) than among Caucasians (0.100). The presence of the CYP2C9*2 variant allele was not associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer; slight but nonstatistically significant elevations in risk were observed for both African-Americans [odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-3.11] and Caucasians (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 0.96-2.48). The ORs were slightly and nonsignificantly elevated for all histologic types without substantive variation. The association also did not vary materially according to smoking history or whether subjects had the homozygous deletion of the GSTM1 gene. We found no support for the hypothesis that the CYP2C9*2 variant allele decreases the risk of lung cancer. The role of P450s, including CYP2C9, in benzo[a]pyrene metabolism is not fully defined, and CYP2C9 catalyses detoxication as well as activation steps. Thus it is not inconceivable that diminished CYP2C9 activity could increase metabolic activation of benzo[a]pyrene to carcinogenic intermediates. Nonetheless, the small increased risk associated the CYP2C9*2 variant allele in our data is consistent with chance and should not be overinterpreted.
CD38 catalyzes not only the formation of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD+ but also the hydrolysis of cADPR to ADP-ribose (ADPR), and ATP inhibits the hydrolysis (Takasawa, S., Tohgo, A., Noguchi, N., Koguma, T., Nata, K., Sugimoto, T., Yonekura, H., and Okamoto, H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 26052-26054). In the present study, using purified recombinant CD38, we showed that the cADPR hydrolase activity of CD38 was inhibited by ATP in a competitive manner with cADPR. To identify the binding site for ATP and/or cADPR, we labeled the purified CD38 with FSBA. Sequence analysis of the lysylendopeptidase-digested fragment of the labeled CD38 indicated that the FSBA-labeled residue was Lys-129. We introduced site-directed mutations to change the Lys-129 of CD38 to Ala and to Arg. Neither mutant was labeled with FSBA nor catalyzed the hydrolysis of cADPR to ADPR. Furthermore, the mutants did not bind cADPR, whereas they still used NAD+ as a substrate to form cADPR and ADPR. These results indicate that Lys-129 of CD38 participates in cADPR binding and that ATP competes with cADPR for the binding site, resulting in the inhibition of the cADPR hydrolase activity of CD38.
CYP3A4 is the major human cytochrome P-450 in a superfamily of heme-thiolate proteins that catalyze the oxidation of numerous lipophilic compounds. In this investigation, we report that CYP3A4 requires a phenolic function for ortho hydroxylation of estradiol and mono-O-demethylated methoxychlor and that CYP3A4 aromatic hydroxylation in general may be dependent on the presence of a free phenolic group. Indeed, when methoxyls were present instead of phenolic hydroxyls, CYP3A4 essentially failed to catalyze ortho hydroxylation. By contrast, of eight additional cDNA-expressed P-450s (CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, and 2E1) examined, only CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 could catalyze ortho hydroxylation of [o-3H]methoxychlor (7.2 and 14.6 pmol/90 min/pmol P-450, respectively), indicating that these isoforms do not require a phenolic hydroxyl for aromatic hydroxylation and that methoxyls do not sterically hinder catalysis by these CYPs. However, with [o-3H]mono-O-demethylated methoxychlor, containing a phenolic group, five isoforms (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) supported ortho hydroxylation. Of these, CYP3A4 exhibited by far the highest rate of hydroxylation at 87.8 pmol/90 min/pmol P-450. Further studies with [2-(3)H]estradiol 3-methyl ether and with [2-(3)H]estradiol revealed a similar and dramatic augmentation of CYP3A4-mediated C2 hydroxylase activity of approximately 75-fold by the presence of the phenolic group in the 3-position. The mechanism of augmentation by the phenolic hydroxyl does not appear to involve the acidic proton of estradiol, since CYP3A4-catalyzed estradiol 2-hydroxylation and testosterone 6-beta-hydroxylation were diminished to an equal extent when incubations were performed at increasing buffer pH values from 7 to 9. Both estradiol and its 3-methoxy derivative bound with similar affinity to cDNA-expressed, microsomal CYP3A4: spectral dissociation constants were 270 and 370 microM, respectively, and both compounds exhibited type I spectra. Thus, the disparities in aromatic hydroxylation rates between compounds containing phenolic hydroxyls and those with methoxyls cannot be explained by differences in their binding affinities. To explain the mode via which the phenolic hydroxyl facilitates ortho hydroxylation, a mechanism in which the phenolic moiety attacks the iron-oxo double bond of CYP3A4, resulting in oxygen transfer to the ortho position, is proposed. It is anticipated that these findings will assist in forecasting the CYP-mediated metabolic fate of phenolic compounds.
CA1 pyramidal cells become hyperexcitable following hippocampal kainate lesions. To examine if axonal sprouting contributes to this epileptiform activity, the local axonal arborization of CA1 pyramidal cells was examined after intracellular labelling with biocytin in hippocampal slices from control rats and in hyperexcitable slices obtained from rats treated with kainate (bilateral intracerebroventricular injections) 2-4 weeks previously. Biocytin-labelled cells with an axon that could be followed from the soma to the alveus were drawn and reconstructed with a camera lucida (15 cells from control slices and 14 cells from hyperexcitable slices). Local axonal arborizations were more extensive in cells of hyperexcitable slices. This increase in axon collaterals was generally seen in the alveus and in stratum oriens, but changes were more prominent in the latter. In stratum oriens, cells from hyperexcitable slices showed a significant increase in mean total axon length (1035 versus 373 mu m in control), in mean number of branching points (6.50 versus 0.67 in control) and in mean number of segment orders per axon (3.07 versus 1.47 in control). Their first-order axon segments were similar in length to those of control cells (236 versus 338 pm in control), but with significantly more branching points (2.86 versus 0.53 in control). Their second-order axon segments were significantly longer (381 versus 63 mu m in control) and also showed more branching points (2.71 versus 0.13 in control). Their third- and fourth-order axon segments were also longer and with more branching points. Under high-power light microscopic examination, biocytin-labelled axonal varicosities in cells of hyperexcitable slices were often seen in close apposition with their own dendrites, presumably making synaptic contact (five of nine cells examined). No such appositions were seen in any of the control cells (seven cells examined). These results indicate that, following kainate lesions, there is sprouting of local axon collaterals of CA1 pyramidal cells in stratum oriens and in the alveus. This local increase in axon collaterals may contribute to the epileptiform activity in the CA1 area by providing recurrent excitation via newly formed synaptic, and perhaps even autaptic, contacts with pyramidal cell dendrites.
SOD2 encodes the Saccharomyces cerevisiae manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial matrix protein. Heme regulates SOD2 transcription during both fermentative and respiratory growth by three mechanisms. First, SOD2 transcription is activated 10-fold by growth on a non-fermentable carbon source via the heme activator protein (Hap) 2-3-4-5 complex. Second, SOD2 transcription is repressed 90% in the absence of heme. Finally, Hap1p, a heme-binding, DNA-binding transcription activator, is required for full SOD2 expression during growth on glucose. Extensive mutational analysis of the SOD2 promoter reveals three cis elements that mediate heme-dependent regulation. Interestingly, the DNA sequences necessary for repression in the absence of heme overlap those that mediate Hap1p activation. Genetic results suggest a novel role for Hap1p in the regulation of repression in the absence of heme.

RPE transplantation offers the possibility of treating certain forms of retinal degeneration. Understanding how to optimize the surgical technique for performing RPE transplantation, especially in primates, is therefore of considerable interest.
CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein possessing an NAD+ glycohydrolase activity in its extracellular domain. We previously reported that the ligation of CD38 by a monoclonal antibody (mAb), HB-7, induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins including p120(c-cbl) in differentiated human myeloid cell lines and that the phosphorylated p120(c-cbl) is capable of binding to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. In the present study, we found that the agonistic anti-CD38 mAb markedly potentiates superoxide generation stimulated by chemotactic formyl-Met-Leu-Phe receptors in the CD38-producing cells. HB-7 neither generated superoxide by itself nor enhanced the cell response induced by phorbol 12-myristate acetate, indicating that the potentiating action of the anti-CD38 mAb is specific for the stimulation by the GTP-binding protein (G1)-coupled membrane receptors. The potentiation by HB-7 was abolished by prior treatment of the cells with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, pertussis toxin, or a potent PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. HB-7 also enhanced the product formation of PI 3-kinase in response to the chemotactic receptor stimulation, without significant changes in the receptor-stimulated accumulations of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate, arachidonate release, and intracellular Ca2+. These results indicate that the CD38-induced tyrosine phosphorylation has a cross-talk with the chemotactic receptor/G1-mediated signal transduction pathway resulting in the enhancement of superoxide generation, probably through the activation of PI 3-kinase.
CD38 is a 45-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein highly expressed in lymphoid progenitors. Ligation of CD38 with specific Abs inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in human immature B cells. CD38 ligation also triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of syk, c-cbl, and phospholipase C-gamma and activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). In the present study, we investigated whether the cell surface membrane molecules used in B cell receptor-mediated signaling, such as Ig alpha, Ig beta, and CD19, could be involved in the CD38-mediated signaling cascade. In the B cell receptor-negative immature B cell lines RS4;11, 380, and REH, Ig alpha and Ig beta were expressed exclusively in the cytoplasm and were not tyrosine phosphorylated after CD38 ligation. By contrast, CD19 was markedly tyrosine phosphorylated and was associated with lyn and PI3-K. PI3-K activation appears to be directly linked to the growth-arresting effects of CD38 ligation, which are reduced by PI3-K inhibitors. Ligation of either CD38 or CD19 resulted in a similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation; both signaling pathways caused tyrosine phosphorylation of c-cbl. Levels of CD38 surface expression were not affected by prolonged incubation with anti-CD19 Ab, while CD19 expression markedly decreased. These results indicate that CD19 is a major component of the CD38 signaling cascade in B cell precursors, serving as a cell surface membrane docking site for cytoplasmic kinases. CD38 and CD19 are not physically linked, but activate an overlapping set of kinases in human immature B cells.
CD38 ligation with the specific mAb IB4 induced early and late signaling events in Jurkat T cells, as judged by the transient induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma1, c-Cbl, zeta-associated protein (ZAP)-70, Shc, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-2 (Erk-2) as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and increased expression of the activation Ag CD69. In addition, CD38 ligation induced Ras-dependent events such as Erk-2 mobility shift and increased Erk-2 kinase activity. Further evidence that Erk-2 activation is regulated by CD38 ligation was obtained indirectly with the observed induction of Raf-1, Lck, and Sos-1 mobility shifts, processes that are believed to be dependent, at least in part, on MAP kinase activation. Using a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, or a protein kinase C inhibitor, Ro-31-8220, we found that the anti-CD38-induced Erk-2 activation is both protein tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C dependent. CD38 ligation also resulted in increased CD3-zeta tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with ZAP-70. CD38 ligation in a Jurkat Lck-deficient mutant, JCam1, failed to induce substrate tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Erk-2. These data indicated that in Jurkat T cells, CD38 receptor triggering results in Lck-regulated activation of both Raf-1/MAP kinase and CD3-zeta/ZAP-70/phospholipase C-gamma1 signaling pathways.
CLC chloride channels form a large and conserved gene family unrelated to other channel proteins. Knowledge of the transmembrane topology of these channels is important for understanding the effects of mutations found in human myotonia and inherited hypercalciuric kidney stone diseases and for the interpretation of structure-function studies. We now systematically study the topology of human ClC-1, a prototype CLC channel that is defective in human myotonia. Using a combination of in vitro glycosylation scanning and protease protection assays, we show that both N and C termini face the cytoplasm and demonstrate the presence of 10 (or less likely 12) transmembrane spans. Difficult regions were additionally tested by inserting cysteines and probing the effect of cysteine-modifying reagents on ClC-1 currents. The results show that D3 crosses the membrane and D4 does not, and that L549 between D11 and D12 is accessible from the outside. Further, since the modification of cysteines introduced between D11 and D12 and at the extracellular end of D3 strongly affect ClC-1 currents, these regions are suggested to be important for ion permeation.
ACE inhibitors have been shown to be effective in reducing the morbidity and mortality of patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, but their application to clinical practice in this situation is still limited. In part, the failure to prescribe an ACE inhibitor to a patient with left ventricular systolic dysfunction is due to perceptions regarding their side effects, such as cough and renal dysfunction. Relatively few patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and a serum creatinine > or = 2 mg/dl receive an ACE inhibitor in clinical practice. In this situation one should consider an agent such as fosinopril, which is metabolized by the liver as well as secreted by the kidney. In patients with moderate renal dysfunction, fosinopril has been well tolerated without an increase in serum creatinine. In patients who develop cough due to an ACE inhibitor, consideration should be given to an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocking agent, such as losartan. The relative safety and efficacy of an ACE inhibitor compared with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocking agent is being explored in a prospective randomized trial (Evaluation of Losartan In The Elderly [ELITE]), as well as the safety and pharmacological effectiveness of adding an angiotensin II receptor antagonist to an ACE inhibitor (Randomized Angiotensin receptor antagonists-ACE-inhibitor Study [RAAS]). There may also be a role for the combination of an aldosterone receptor antagonists and an ACE inhibitor in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Once an ACE inhibitor is administered to a patient with left ventricular systolic dysfunction it should be continued indefinitely. ACE inhibitors may be of value not only in preventing the progression of heart failure but also in reversing endothelial dysfunction and preventing the development of atherosclerosis and its consequences, such as myocardial infarction.
CP 47, a component of photosystem II (PSII) in higher plants, algae and cyanobacteria, is encoded by the psbB gene. Site-specific mutagenesis has been used to alter a portion of the psbB gene encoding the large extrinsic loop E of CP 47 in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803. Alteration of a lysine residue occurring at position 321 to glycine produced a strain with altered PSII activity. This strain grew at wild-type rates in complete BG-11 media (480 microM chloride). However, oxygen evolution rates for this mutant in complete media were only 60% of the observed wild-type rates. Quantum yield measurements at low light intensities indicated that the mutant had 66% of the fully functional PSII centers contained in the control strain. The mutant proved to be extremely sensitive to photoinactivation at high light intensities, exhibiting a 3-fold increase in the rate of photoinactivation. When this mutant was grown in media depleted of chloride (30 microM chloride), it lost the ability to grow photoautotrophically while the control strain exhibited a normal rate of growth. The effect of chloride depletion on the growth rate of the mutant was reversed by the addition of 480 microM bromide to the chloride-depleted BG-11 media. In the presence of glucose, the mutant and control strains grew at comparable rates in either chloride-containing or chloride-depleted media. Oxygen evolution rates for the mutant were further depressed (28% of control rates) under chloride-limiting conditions. Addition of bromide restored these rates to those observed under chloride-sufficient conditions. Measurements of the variable fluorescence yield indicated that the mutant assembled fewer functional centers in the absence of chloride. These results indicate that the mutation K321G in CP 47 affects PSII stability and/or assembly under conditions where chloride is limiting.
ACE inhibitors are widely used in treating hypertension and heart failure, but the sites and mechanisms of ACE inhibition in human blood vessels are not understood. The present study was undertaken to assess the sites and extent of in vivo inhibition of ACE by long-term perindopril treatment in different layers of the internal mammary artery in patients with ischemic heart disease.
CD36 is a cell surface receptor that has been shown to interact with a large variety of ligands including thrombospondin, collagen, Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes, apoptotic neutrophils, modified low density lipoproteins, anionic phospholipids and long chain fatty acids. A number of these CD36 ligands elicit the transduction of intracellular signals involved in cell activation and internalization of bound ligands. The engagement of CD36 possibly activates three cytosolic protein tyrosine kinases that are presumably associated with the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CD36. However, the mechanisms by which CD36 functions in ligand binding and signal transduction are poorly understood. In the present study, a membrane-bound and a truncated soluble form of CD36 were expressed in HeLa cells and analyzed by velocity-gradient centrifugation and chemical cross-linking. We show that membrane CD36 exists predominantly as a monomer but a homodimeric form is also found. In contrast, soluble CD36 sedimented in sucrose gradient as a monomer. However, when incubated with thrombospondin, the membrane form of CD36 predominantly sedimented as a dimer whereas soluble CD36 was monomeric. This study shows that thrombospondin has the ability to induce dimerization of CD36 and may be implicated in the signal transduction capacity of this adhesion molecule.
CD38 ligation on mouse B cells by CS/2, an anti-mouse CD38 mAb, induced proliferation, interleukin 5 (IL-5) receptor alpha chain expression, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) from wild-type, but not from X chromosome-linked, immunodeficient mice. B cells from fyn-deficient (Fyn-/-) and lyn-deficient (Lyn-/-) mice showed an impaired response to mAb CS/2 for proliferation and IL-5 receptor alpha chain expression, and B cells from fyn/lyn double-deficient (Fyn/Lyn-/-) mice did not respond at all to mAb CS/2. The Btk activation by CD38 ligation was observed in B cells from Fyn-/- mice, and it was severely impaired in B cells from Lyn-/- and Fyn/Lyn-/- mice. CD38 expression on B cells from three mutant strains was comparable to that on control B cells. We infer from these results that both Fyn and Lyn are required and that their signals are synergistic for B cell triggering after CD38 ligation. Lyn is upstream of Btk activation in the CD38 signaling. Stimulation of B cells with IL-5 together with CD38 ligation induces not only IgM but also IgG1 secretion. Analysis of the synergistic effects of IL-5 and CD38 ligation on IgG1 secretion revealed the impaired IgG1 secretion of B cells from Lyn-/- and Fyn/Lyn-/- mice. These data imply that Lyn is involved in B cell triggering by CD38 ligation plus IL-5 for isotype switching.
CA1 field potentials evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation of hippocampal slices from trace-conditioned rabbits were compared with those from naive and pseudo-conditioned controls. Conditioned rabbits received 80 trace conditioning trials daily until reaching a criterion of 80% conditioned responses in a session. Hippocampal slices were prepared 1 or 24 h after reaching criterion (for trace-conditioned animals) or after a final unpaired stimulus session (for pseudo-conditioned animals); naive animals were untrained. Both somatic and dendritic field potentials were recorded in response to various stimulus durations. Recording and data reduction were performed blind to the conditioning state of the rabbit. The excitatory postsynaptic potential slope was greater in slices prepared from trace-conditioned animals killed 1 h after conditioning than in naive and pseudo-conditioned controls (repeated-measures analysis of variance, F = 4.250, P < 0.05). Associative learning specifically enhanced synaptic transmission between CA3 and CA1 immediately after training. This effect was not evident in the population field potential measured 24 h later.
ABO antigen-antibody interaction in the presence of peripheral blood leukocytes (white cells) results in the production of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines. However, although tumor necrosis factor alpha has been shown to be derived at least primarily from monocytes, the range of cells activated by this process has not previously been reported. Therefore, changes in mononuclear cell surface antigen expression were studied, to determine which subsets of white cells appeared to be activated in the setting of ABO incompatibility.
PGD (preimplantation genetic diagnosis) of aneuploidy for chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18 and 21 was carried out on 196 embryos from 36 infertile patients classified with a poor prognosis due to (i) maternal age, (ii) repeated in-vitro fertilization (IVF) failures and (iii) mosaic karyotype. The percentage of abnormal embryos was comparable in the three groups of patients: maternal age 63%, repeated IVF failure 57%, and mosaic karyotype 62%. The analysis of the overall data revealed an increased incidence of abnormal embryos in the older age categories (predominantly due to aneuploidy), even in embryos at the 7- to 8-cell stage. In addition, the percentage of chromosomally abnormal embryos was directly proportional to the number of IVF failures, where the increase in chromosomal abnormalities was not correlated to aneuploidy but to other aberrations such as mosaicism and polyploidy. Following PGD, 28 patients had at least one embryo transferred that appeared normal by fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH). Four clinical pregnancies resulted, with an implantation rate of 10% per normal embryo. In conclusion, the high rate of chromosomally abnormal embryos in poor prognosis patients may have been the cause of implantation failure in their previous IVF cycles. Therefore, the possibility of transferring embryos with a normal FISH complement could improve the chance of pregnancy in this category of patients.
ACE inhibitors can attenuate the development of intimal fibrocellular lesions after balloon catheter vessel injury, but the mechanisms responsible are unknown.
MAOA and MAOB are key iso-enzymes that degrade biogenic and dietary amines. MAOA preferentially oxidizes serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE), whereas MAOB preferentially oxidizes beta-phenylethylamine (PEA). Both forms can oxidize dopamine (DA). A mutation in MAOA results in a clinical phenotype characterized by borderline mental retardation and impaired impulse control. X-chromosomal deletions which include MAOB were found in patients suffering from atypical Norrie's disease, which is characterized by blindness and impaired hearing. Reduced MAOB activity has been found in type-II alcoholism and in cigarette smokers. Because most alcoholics smoke, the effects of alcohol on MAOB activity remain to be determined. Here we show that targetted inactivation of MAOB in mice increases levels of PEA but not those of 5-HT, NE and DA, demonstrating a primary role for MAOB in the metabolism of PEA. PEA has been implicated in modulating mood and affect. Indeed, MAOB-deficient mice showed an increased reactivity to stress. In addition, mutant mice were resistant to the neurodegenerative effects of MPTP, a toxin that induces a condition reminiscent of Parkinson's disease.
PGD has been successfully used for several years. Over 40 babies have been born worldwide by use of these techniques. Unfortunately, a number of misdiagnoses have been made, a distressing consequence of a new frontier. Significant advances have been made to improve the efficiency and accuracy of PCR and FISH. The widespread use of this technology awaits further documentation of safety and accuracy. Other issues must also be addressed. First, the cost-effectiveness of the techniques relative to the traditional alternatives must be evaluated. A number of ethical issues regarding embryo screening must be addressed including what diseases are serious enough to warrant the procedure. Another concern is the use of this technology for nongenetic disorders such as gender selection. Finally, the experimental nature of these procedures must continually be discussed with patients, and long-term follow-up studies must be undertaken. Development of more accurate and less expensive assays coupled with improved IVF success rates may make PGD a more widely used clinical tool. The future awaits these developments.
SCD is defined as unexpected death due to cardiac causes that occurs within 1 hour of acute symptoms. SCD can be reversed with the use of an ICD. These devices now can be implanted by catheter techniques, obviating thoracotomy. SCD is preventable. The incidence of SCD can be significantly reduced by addressing the fundamental pathophysiology of SCD, which primarily is CAD. Our combined and aggressive implementation of preventive regimens to reduce the risk of cardiac events will save lives. These measures include diet, weight reduction, smoking cessation, regular exercise, and therapeutic drugs. Amiodarone, although effective in preventing lethal ventricular arrhythmias, has not matched the long-term results of the ICD in the successful management of SCD.
CS is commonly used in conjunction with CV procedures. Although CS provides a means to manage patient anxiety and discomfort, it also poses risks for the CV patient. The RN in the CV procedure lab plays a key role in the management of patients receiving CS. By formulating an individualized CS plan that integrates procedure risks, underlying disease processes, and medication effects, the RN minimizes patient risks and optimizes symptom management.
CS can safely be administered to the elderly population. The definition of elderly is a subjective term. That is, each patient should be considered as an individual person with different physiologic and psychologic needs. Special attention must be given to ensure a safe environment for induction of sedation. The patient should be fully assessed, keeping in mind the physiologic changes that accompany aging. Elderly patients have an increased variability of drug response. Elderly patients have a decreased requirement for most anesthetic drugs. Elderly patients have an increased redosing interval. Continuous monitoring for signs of intolerance and cautious administration of sedation will help reduce the risks associated with sedation in the elderly.
CS is an alternative to general anesthesia or MAC in some diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and surgeries, and it can be equally effective in ensuring adequate sedation to facilitate completion of the procedure. It does come with some expense, although still not as costly as general anesthesia. Use of this technique must be undertaken with caution and concern for patient safety, however, and thus some additional expenses will be incurred. With careful selection of the agents used, proper equipment for monitoring, and extensive physician and staff education, the technique has the advantage over general anesthesia in terms of cost not only to the institution but also to patients and to third-party payers.
UGT2B17 is a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme expressed in several extrahepatic steroid target tissues, including the human prostate, where it glucuronidates C19 steroids such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androsterone (ADT), and androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol (3alpha-diol). To determine if UGT2B17 is regulated by physiological effectors of the human prostate, DHT and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were demonstrated to specifically down-regulate the steady-state levels of UGT2B17 transcript and protein in LNCaP cells (Guillemette et al., 1997). These results implicate regulation of UGT2B17 at the level of gene transcription, therefore, a P-1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) clone of 120 kb containing the entire UGT2B17 gene was isolated. The gene is comprised of six exons spanning approximately 30 kb, and fluorescence in situ hybridization of the UGT2B17 PAC clone to normal human lymphocyte chromosomes, mapped the gene to chromosome 4q13. To determine if the 5'-flanking DNA of the UGT2B17 gene is sufficient to confer gene expression, a 2,942-bp fragment was subcloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid and yielded an activity of 25-fold over background when transfected in LNCaP cells. However, transfection of the construct into HK-293, MCF-7, JEG-3, and HepG2 cells yielded only a moderate activity of two- to five-fold over background. Treatment of transfected LNCaP cells with 10 nM R1881, a nonmetabolizable analog of DHT, and 10 ng/ml EGF decreased the luciferase activity by 60%. This suggests that at least part, if not all, of the inhibitory effect of EGF and DHT on UGT2B17 is at the level of transcription. Progressive 5' deletions of the UGT2B17 5'-flanking region in the luciferase constructs alleviated the inhibition by R1881 and EGF, and revealed several potential responsive elements that may confer the observed regulation of the UGT2B17 gene. This study demonstrates regulation of the UGT2B17 gene by physiological effectors of the human prostate and supports the hypothesis that UGT enzymes are involved in steroid metabolism in extrahepatic tissues.
CD38 is a type-II transmembrane glycoprotein occurring in several hematopoietic and mature blood cells as well as in other cell types, including neurons. Although classified as an orphan receptor, CD38 is also a bifunctional ectoenzyme that catalyzes both the conversion of NAD+ to nicotinamide and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), via an ADP-ribosyl cyclase reaction, and also the hydrolysis of cADPR to ADP-ribose (hydrolase). Major unresolved questions concern the correlation between receptor and catalytic properties of CD38, and also the apparent contradiction between ectocellular generation and intracellular Ca(2+)-mobilizing activity of cADPR. Results are presented that provide some explanations to this topological paradox in two different cell types. In cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons, extracellular cADPR (either generated by CD38 or directly added) elicited an enhanced intracellular Ca(2+)-response to KCl-induced depolarization, a process that can be qualified as a Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) mechanism. On the other hand, in the CD38+ human Namalwa B lymphoid cells, NAD+ (and thiol compounds as well) induced a two-step process of self-aggregation followed by endocytosis of CD38, which resulted in a shift of cADPR metabolism from the cell surface to the cytosol. Both distinctive types of cellular responses to extracellular NAD+ seem to be suitable to elicit changes in the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis.
ACE inhibitor is known to have a therapeutic efficacy in renal diseases by reducing proteinuria and maintaining renal function. However, the relationship between ACE gene polymorphism and renal disease has not been fully elucidated. In this study, a 287 base pair(bp) I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene was examined with polymerase chain reaction(PCR) in 100 healthy subjects, 34 patients with chronic glomerulonephritis(CGN), 29 with chronic renal failure(CRF) and 25 with diabetes mellitus(DM) with(13) and without(12) nephropathy. We also measured serum ACE activity of these patients. ACE genotype and derived allele frequencies in each disease group did not differ significantly from those in healthy subjects. In all disease groups, values of serum ACE activity were higher in genotype DD than in genotype II. These findings suggest no significant association between I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene and renal disease. Further studies are needed to clarify these findings, considering renal function and type of renal disease.
CD36 is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on the surface of a number of cell types. The analysis of CD36 from platelets using immunoblotting, gel filtration, and native PAGE indicated the presence of high molecular complexes exceeding the Mr of monomeric CD36. Experiments using transfected COS-7 cells revealed these complexes were homodimers and -multimers of CD36. The multimers could be dissociated by treatment with a reducing agent, indicating they were formed by intermolecular cysteine-bridging. Mutagenesis of the cDNA for CD36 implicated the cysteines in the extracellular domain of the molecule. The potential physiological roles of CD36 multimerisation are discussed.
G6PD deficiency is the most frequent enzymopathy-producing genetic polymorphism in humans. Up to now, over 400 putative variants of G6PD have been distinguished on the basis of biochemical characterization of the deficient enzyme. Analysis of the G6PD gene has made possible a precise classification of the G6PD molecular variants by identification of about 80 different point mutations causing much of the phenotypic heterogeneity. In the Spanish population, the analysis of G6PD has led to the identification of 15 different point mutations that underlay the phenotypic heterogeneity of G6PD previously reported by biochemical analysis. The purpose of the study has been to identify the genetic mutation responsible of the G6PD deficiency and to improve the knowledge of its genetic homogeneity.
SDS gel electrophoresis showed the presence of connectin, approximately 3000 kDa, in skeletal muscles of fishes, lamprey, electric ray and horse mackerel. The antibodies to avian or mammalian skeletal muscle connectin, 3B9 and Pc1200, reacted with all the fish connectins. However, a monoclonal antibody SM1 recognized electric ray connectin but did not react with lamprey and horse mackerel connectins. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the epitope to Pc1200 was localized at the periphery of the Z line of all the fish muscle sarcomeres and that to SM1 was located at the N2 line in the I band of ray muscle. These two localizations are the same as those in rabbit, chicken and frog skeletal muscles. On the other hand, the positions of epitopes to 3B9 were variable in the three classes of fishes, although all of them were localized in the A band. Some of the epitope positions were common to those in chicken skeletal muscle. Thus the present work demonstrates biodiversity of connectin in fish skeletal muscles, distinct from avian and mammalian skeletal muscles.
"CD38 was first identified as a lymphocyte differentiation antigen that showed typical properties of an orphan receptor involved in many programs of cell proliferation and activation. However, CD38 proved also to be a bifunctional ectoenzyme that catalyzes the transient formation of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) in a variety of cell types. This property raises many intriguing and so far unanswered questions, since cADPR is a new second messenger molecule directly involved in the control of calcium homeostasis by means of receptor-mediated release of calcium from ryanodine-sensitive intracellular stores. The relationship between receptor-like and enzymatic properties of CD38 is still unknown. The apparent topological paradox of ectocellular synthesis and intracellular activity of cADPR might be explained by: (a) influx of cADPR across the plasma membrane to reach its target stores, as suggested by experiments on cerebellar granule cells; and (b) NAD(+)-induced internalization, following membrane oligomerization, of CD38 with consequent partial import of cADPR metabolism to an intracellular compartment, as recently observed in lymphoid B cells. These two distinct mechanisms and other potential ones (e.g. binding of ectocellularly formed cADPR to cell surface receptors and initiation of signal-transducing pathways across the plasmamembrane) seem to be paradigmatic of processes affecting different types of cells. Although in some biological systems, such as Aplysia and sea urchin egg, cADPR metabolism is restricted to the intracellular environment, in mammalian cells the CD38/cADPR system provides new challenges in terms of subcellular compartmentation and qualifies as an unusual example of ""ectobiochemistry"" with potential, still unrecognized, properties of cellular regulation."
UGT2B7 has been cloned and expressed previously in COS cells and HK293 cells. Two forms have been identified: one with a tyrosine and one with a histidine at position 268. UGT2B7 has been shown to catalyze NSAIDs, catechol estrogens, and morphine-3- and -6-glucuronidation. cDNAs for UGT2B7Y268 and H268 were cloned and stably expressed in HK 293 cells. Studies were designed to test each form for reactivity toward a number of opioid compounds, xenobiotics such as menthol, oxazepam, and propranolol, and androgens such as androsterone and testosterone using membrane preparations derived from HK 293 cells. Both UGT2B7Y and UGT2B7H are highly reactive with many opioids, menthol, androsterone, and (R)- and (S)-propranolol, and similar kinetic values were observed. UGT2B7Y and UGT2B7H react poorly with oxazepam and no difference in (R)- or (S)-glucuronidation rate ratios was found. Thus, UGT2B7Y and H cannot account for the variability in the plasma or urine concentrations of these glucuronides in human populations. Our data suggest that UGT2B7 is a major isoform responsible for the glucuronidation of androsterone. Neither UGT2B7Y nor H catalyzes the glucuronidation of testosterone although each catalyzes the glucuronidation of epitestosterone. UGT2B7 seems to be a major human isoform responsible for the glucuronidation of opioids of the morphinan and oripavine class and is capable of catalyzing the glucuronidation of both the 3- and 6-hydroxyl moieties on these molecules. Thus, UGT2B7 plays a major role in the conversion of morphine to morphine-6-glucuronide, the potent analgesic metabolite of morphine.
PAH (N-(4-aminobenzoyl)glycin) clearance measurements have been used for 50 years in clinical research for the determination of renal plasma flow. The quantitation of PAH in plasma or urine is generally performed by colorimetric method after diazotation reaction but the measurements must be corrected for the unspecific residual response observed in blank plasma. We have developed a HPLC method to specifically determine PAH and its metabolite NAc-PAH using a gradient elution ion-pair reversed-phase chromatography with UV detection at 273 and 265 nm, respectively. The separations were performed at room temperature on a ChromCart (125 mmx4 mm I.D.) Nucleosil 100-5 microm C18AB cartridge column, using a gradient elution of MeOH-buffer pH 3.9 1:99-->15:85 over 15 min. The pH 3.9 buffered aqueous solution consisted in a mixture of 375 ml sodium citrate-citric acid solution (21.01 g citric acid and 8.0 g NaOH per liter), added up with 2.7 ml H3PO4 85%, 1.0 g of sodium heptanesulfonate and completed ad 1000 ml with ultrapure water. The N-acetyltransferase activity does not seem to notably affect PAH clearances, although NAc-PAH represents 10.2+/-2.7% of PAH excreted unchanged in 12 healthy subjects. The performance of the HPLC and the colorimetric method have been compared using urine and plasma samples collected from healthy volunteers. Good correlations (r=0.94 and 0.97, for plasma and urine, respectively) are found between the results obtained with both techniques. However, the colorimetric method gives higher concentrations of PAH in urine and lower concentrations in plasma than those determined by HPLC. Hence, both renal (ClR) and systemic (Cls) clearances are systematically higher (35.1 and 17.8%, respectively) with the colorimetric method. The fraction of PAH excreted by the kidney ClR/ClS calculated from HPLC data (n=143) is, as expected, always <1 (mean=0.73+/-0.11), whereas the colorimetric method gives a mean extraction ratio of 0.87+/-0.13 implying some unphysiological values (>1). In conclusion, HPLC not only enables the simultaneous quantitation of PAH and NAc-PAH, but may also provide more accurate and precise PAH clearance measurements.
SPR Online (http:@www.pedrad.org) is a recently developed digital representation of the Society for Pediatric Radiology (SPR) that enables physicians to access pertinent information and services on the Internet. SPR Online was organized on the basis of the five main services of the SPR, which include Administration, Patient Care, Education, Research, and Meetings. For each service, related content from the SPR was digitized and placed onto SPR Online. Usage over a 12-month period was evaluated with server log file analysis. A total of 3,209 users accessed SPR Online, viewing 11,246 pages of information. A wide variety of information was accessed, with that from the Education, Administration, and Meetings services being the most popular. Fifteen percent of users came from foreign countries. As a virtual professional society, SPR Online greatly enhances the power and scope of the SPR and has proved to be a popular resource, meeting the diverse information needs of an international community of pediatric radiologists.
ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) gene genotypes have been shown to be a risk factor for development of left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy, upon the assumption that the DD genotype is linked to higher cellular ACE activity leading to myocardial fibrosis. To test an analogous hypothesis that the DD genotype favors myocardial fibrosis in the atrium and thus promotes atrial fibrillation without any structural heart diseases, we determined the distribution of the ACE gene genotypes in 77 patients with lone atrial fibrillation and investigated the effects of the ACE genotypes on the clinical characteristics of atrial fibrillation. The distribution of ACE genotypes was not significantly different between the patients and healthy volunteers. Also, the ACE gene genotypes did not affect the types of atrial fibrillation and the age at the onset of atrial fibrillation. Thus, these results refuted the hypothesis of possible relationships between ACE genotypes and lone atrial fibrillation through myocardial fibrosis, and indicated some unknown differences between the atrium and ventricle.
NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) is an adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) that contributes to a protein complex essential for membrane fusion. The synaptic function of this protein was investigated by injecting, into the giant presynaptic terminal of squid, peptides that inhibit the ATPase activity of NSF stimulated by the soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP). These peptides reduced the amount and slowed the kinetics of neurotransmitter release as a result of actions that required vesicle turnover and occurred at a step subsequent to vesicle docking. These results define NSF as an essential participant in synaptic vesicle exocytosis that regulates the kinetics of neurotransmitter release and, thereby, the integrative properties of synapses.
CFTR is a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-activated chloride (Cl-) channel and a regulator of outwardly rectifying Cl- channels (ORCCs) in airway epithelia. CFTR regulates ORCCs by facilitating the release of ATP out of cells. Once released from cells, ATP stimulates ORCCs by means of a purinergic receptor. To define the domains of CFTR important for Cl- channel function and/or ORCC regulator function, mutant CFTRs with N- and C-terminal truncations and selected individual amino acid substitutions were created and studied by transfection into a line of human airway epithelial cells from a cystic fibrosis patient (IB3-1) or by injection of in vitro transcribed complementary RNAs (cRNAs) into Xenopus oocytes. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings, 36Cl- efflux assays, and whole cell patch-clamp recordings were used to assay for the Cl- channel function of CFTR and for its ability to regulate ORCCs. The data showed that the first transmembrane domain (TMD-1) of CFTR, especially predicted alpha-helices 5 and 6, forms an essential part of the Cl- channel pore, whereas the first nucleotide-binding and regulatory domains (NBD1/R domain) are essential for its ability to regulate ORCCs. Finally, the data show that the ability of CFTR to function as a Cl- channel and a conductance regulator are not mutually exclusive; one function could be eliminated while the other was preserved.
CYP2C19 (S-mephenytoin hydroxylase) is a polymorphically expressed enzyme. Currently, two defective alleles are known--CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3. The authors have developed an oligonucleotide ligation assay to detect these two alleles. This assay combines the hybridization of one common, biotinylated capture probe and two allele-specific probes to the target DNA, with the ability of a DNA ligase to distinguish mismatched nucleotides. The probes are only ligated if they are base paired correctly to the target strand. The biotin is bound to streptavidin, and all DNA not covalently bound to the biotin-labeled capture probe, is removed in a washing procedure. The allele-specific probes are labeled with either europium or samarium, and their emission can be measured simultaneously. The ratio between the emission separates the genotypes. This method was applied on DNA from 19 whites and 21 Vietnamese living in Denmark. All genotypes determined by the assay were consistent with the results from restriction enzyme cleavage. There were 12 poor metabolizers; 10 homozygous CYP2C19*2/CYP2C19*2, one heterozygous CYP2C19*2/CYP2C19*3, and one heterozygous CYP2C19*1/CYP2C19*2. The authors conclude that this assay is well-suited for a high throughput of samples in a routine laboratory. The finding of an apparently heterozygous CYP2C19*1/CYP2C19*2 poor metabolizer, confirms that there are still unknown mutations in CYP2C19.
UCP2 has been proposed to regulate thermogenesis and energy expenditure. To identify potential mechanisms underlying the increased energy expenditure and heat production during infection, we investigated whether LPS and cytokines might increase UCP2 mRNA levels in mice. LPS (100 micrograms, i.p.) increased the expression of UCP2 mRNA in liver (28-fold) and muscle and white adipose tissue (5-fold). In liver, both IL-1 beta (1 microgram, i.p.) and TNF (5 micrograms, i.p.) increased UCP2 mRNA levels, 4- and 3-fold respectively, whereas in muscle and fat tissue, an increase was detectable after TNF, but not IL-1 beta. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg, i.p.) administered immediately before LPS markedly reduced (70%) the ability of LPS to increase UCP2 mRNA in liver, but not in muscle or adipose tissue. These results suggest a role for UCP2 in the heat production and increased energy expenditure that occurs during infection.
ALAD porphyria is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from a homozygous aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) deficiency. Because of an almost complete lack of ALAD activity, patients excrete a large amount of ALA, but not PBG, into urine. The symptoms in this disease are similar to those seen in AIP, but ALAD porphyria can be differentiated from AIP by its autosomal recessive, rather than dominant, inheritance, by the lack of PBG overproduction, and by markedly decreased ALAD activity.
CD38 is a bifunctional ectoenzyme, predominantly expressed on hematopoietic cells during differentiation, that catalyzes the synthesis (cyclase) and the degradation (hydrolase) of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a powerful calcium mobilizer from intracellular stores. Due to the well established role of calcium levels in the regulation of apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation, the CD38/cADPR system seems to be a likely candidate involved in the control of these fundamental processes. The ectocellular localization of the cyclase activity, however, contrasts with the intracellular site of action of cADPR. Here we demonstrate that ectocellular expression of human CD38 in CD38(-) HeLa and 3T3 cells results in intracellular CD38 substrate (NAD+ + NADH) consumption and product (cADPR) accumulation. Furthermore, a causal relationship is established between presence of intracellular cADPR, partial depletion of thapsigargin-sensitive calcium stores, increase in basal free cytoplasmic calcium concentration, and decrease of cell doubling time. The significant shortening of the S phase in CD38(+) HeLa cells, as compared with controls, demonstrates an effect of intracellular cADPR on the mammalian cell cycle.
PAH emission from the powered engines fueled by a 95 leadfree gasoline (95-LFG), a 92 leadfree gasoline (92-LFG) and a Premium leaded gasoline (PLG) with two gasoline additives (SA and SB) were collected using a PAH sampling system with a particulate interception device. Twenty one PAHs were analyzed primarily by an GC/MS, while eight metal elements were determined mainly by an ICP-AES. This investigation showed that the gasoline additives contain more amounts of carcinogenic PAHs than gasolines do. Blending these additives do raise the PAH content in the gasolines, simultaneously, will emit more amount of PAHs from the tailpipe of engine exhaust. It is suggested that before a gasoline additive is commercialized, an assessment on its PAH emission should be evaluated to make sure that the additive will not emit more PAHs and cause adverse effect on public health.
CYP2E1 is the main enzyme responsible for chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylase activity in human liver. Here, it is shown that marmoset monkey liver microsomal fraction catalyses this reaction at a similar rate and with a similar Km to human liver and that the activity is increased 4-fold in marmosets treated with isoniazid, a known inducer of CYP2E1. This indicates that CYP2E1 is present in marmoset liver. However conversely, an anti-peptide antibody targeted against the C-terminus of human and cynomolgus monkey CYP2E1 (Val-Ile-Pro-Arg-Ser) failed to bind to marmoset monkey hepatic microsomal fraction. To investigate if there is a difference in the C-terminus of CYP2E1 in these species, this region of marmoset CYP2E1 was sequenced following amplification of marmoset liver cDNA with primers selected according to conserved regions identified in human and cynomolgus monkey CYP2E1. It was found that the deduced amino acid sequence of marmoset CYP2E1 in this region is very similar to human CYP2E1, but due to two base differences in the marmoset nucleic acid sequence, the C-terminus of marmoset CYP2E1 is extended by 2 amino acids, i.e. Val-Ile-Pro-Arg-Ser-Ser-Val. This difference is sufficient to prevent the binding of an antibody raised against the C-terminus of human CYP2E1. The expression of CYP2E1 in the marmoset was confirmed by raising an antibody against the deduced C-terminus of marmoset CYP2E1 (Pro-Arg-Ser-Ser-Val). In immunoblotting, this antibody bound to a single protein of 54 kDa in marmoset liver microsomal fraction. The intensity of the band was increased in isoniazid-treated marmosets, consistent with induction of CYP2E1. The antibody did not recognise human or cynomolgus monkey CYP2E1. This was expected since the immunising peptide sequence does not occur in these enzymes. The results demonstrate the presence of CYP2E1 in marmoset liver and illustrate the importance of the C-terminus for the production of specific antibodies against P450 enzymes.
CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is extensively expressed on cells of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic lineage. Although the intracellular domain of CD38 is not homologous to any known proteins, the extracellular domain of CD38 is structurally related to enzymes in the ADP-ribosyl cyclase family. The structural homology between CD38 and the cyclase family members extends to functional homology, as the extracellular domain of CD38 can mediate the catalysis of beta-NAD+ into nicotinamide, ADP-ribose (ADPR) and, to a lesser extent, into cyclic ADPR-ribose (cADPR). Extensive investigation in other systems has shown that cADPR is an important regulator of intracellular Ca2+ release. Since engagement of CD38 on hematopoietic cells with anti-CD38 Abs has been shown to have potent effects on a number of in vitro cellular responses, we have speculated that cADPR might control CD38-mediated signal transduction. However, it has been difficult to understand how a mediator which is typically an intracellular signaling molecule could potentiate its effects from an extracellular location, thus posing a dilemma which pertains to all ecto-enzymes and the mechanisms by which they regulate signal transduction and cellular processes. This review describes the biologic properties of murine CD38, its role in humoral immunity, and its signal transduction properties in B lymphocytes. We suggest that signaling through CD38 represents a new paradigm in lymphocyte signal transduction and is predicated upon extracellular, rather than intracellular, crosstalk.
PC cell derived growth factor (PCDGF) is an 88-kDa glycoprotein purified from the culture medium of the highly tumorigenic mouse teratoma-derived cell line PC. PCDGF was shown to stimulate the proliferation of 3T3 fibroblasts and PC cells. Amino acid sequencing of PCDGF indicated its identity to the precursor for the 6-kDa polypeptides epithelins and granulins. In this paper, we investigated the binding of PCDGF to the mink lung epithelial cell line CCL64. Scatchard analysis indicates that 125I-PCDGF binding to CCL64 cells is curvilinear, corresponding to the existence of two classes of binding sites: high affinity binding sites (560 +/- 170 sites/cell) with a Kd1 of 43 +/- 15 pM and low affinity binding sites (16,350 +/- 5900 sites/cell) with a Kd2 of 3.9 +/- 1.9 nM. 125I-PCDGF was chemically crosslinked to cell surface receptors on CCL64 cells with disuccinimidyl suberate. A major crosslinked band of about 190 kDa with radiolabeled PCDGF was detected after SDS-PAGE, suggesting the presence of PCDGF binding sites with molecular weight of about 120 kDa. 125I. PCDGF crosslinking studies indicate the presence of PCDGF binding sites with a molecular weight similar to those of binding sites on CCL64 cells on the surface of two other PCDGF-responsive cell lines, 3T3 fibroblasts and PC cells. These data suggest that the receptors for PCDGF are widely distributed on cells of distinct embryonic origin.
ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists may favorably affect serum lipids and glucose metabolism. The primary aim of the Fosinopril Versus Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Randomized Trial (FACET) was to compare the effects of fosinopril and amlodipine on serum lipids and diabetes control in NIDDM patients with hypertension. Prospectively defined cardiovascular events were assessed as secondary outcomes.
PAH (N-(4-aminobenzoyl)-glycin) clearance measurements have been used for 50 years in clinical research for the determination of renal plasma flow. The quantitation of PAH in plasma or urine is generally performed by colorimetric method after diazotation reaction. Although straightforward, the measurements must be corrected for the nonspecific residual response observed in blank plasma. We have therefore developed an HPLC method for the specific determination of PAH and its metabolite NAc-PAH using a gradient elution ion-pair reverse-phase chromatography with UV detection. The Nacetyltransferase (NAT-1 or NAT-2 dependent) activity does not seem clinically relevant nor does it affect notably PAH clearances, although NAc-PAH represents 10.2 +/- 2.7% of the PAH excreted unchanged in 12 healthy subjects. The performance of the HPLC technique has been compared with the colorimetric method using urine and plasma samples collected from 12 healthy volunteers following a priming dose of PAH followed by a constant rate infusion. Good correlations (r = 0.94 and 0.97, for plasma and urine respectively) are found between the results obtained with both techniques. However, the colorimetric method gives higher concentrations of PAH in urine while the concentrations in plasma are lower than those determined by HPLC. Hence, both renal (CLR = U x V/P) and systemic (CLS = Rinf/Css) clearances are systematically higher (35.1%, resp. 17.8%) with the colorimetric method. The fraction of PAH excreted by the kidney CLR/CLS calculated from HPLC data (n = 143) is, as expected, always < 1 (mean = 0.73 +/- 0.11), whereas the colorimetric method gives a mean extraction ratio of 0.87 +/- 0.13 implying unphysio-logical values (> 1) in some cases. In conclusion HPLC not only enables the simultaneous quantitation of PAH and NAc-PAH, but may also provide more accurate and precise PAH clearance measurements.
ACE inhibitors have achieved widespread usage in the treatment of cardiovascular and renal disease. ACE inhibitors alter the balance between the vasoconstrictive, salt-retentive, and hypertrophic properties of angiotensin II (Ang II) and the vasodilatory and natriuretic properties of bradykinin and alter the metabolism of a number of other vasoactive substances. ACE inhibitors differ in the chemical structure of their active moieties, in potency, in bioavailability, in plasma half-life, in route of elimination, in their distribution and affinity for tissue-bound ACE, and in whether they are administered as prodrugs. Thus, the side effects of ACE inhibitors can be divided into those that are class specific and those that relate to specific agents. ACE inhibitors decrease systemic vascular resistance without increasing heart rate and promote natriuresis. They have proved effective in the treatment of hypertension, they decrease mortality in congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, and they delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Ongoing studies will elucidate the effect of ACE inhibitors on cardiovascular mortality in essential hypertension, the role of ACE inhibitors in patients without ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, and the role of ACE inhibitors compared with newly available angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists.
CD38 is a multifunctional membrane surface glycoprotein expressed by different cells and tissues, including T cells at certain stages of their development. Besides its involvement in transmembrane signaling, CD38 play a role in cell adhesion processes. Structurally, membrane CD38 was reported as presenting lateral associations with molecules involved in recognition and signaling, namely with the TCR/CD3 complex in T cells. Here we report that ligation of CD38 by agonistic and non-agonistic monoclonal antibodies exerts different effects on T cells, the former inducing down-modulation of the associated molecules, probably through a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. This observation supports the view that the reduced expression of TCR/CD3 is secondary to interplay with CD38-mediated signaling, which partially overlaps with the CD3-mediated pathway. CD3 ligation by monoclonal antibodies leads not only to the expected internalization of the TCR/CD3 complex but also to down-modulation of surface CD38. The results obtained indicate that CD38 is closely associated with the CD3/TCR complex and that co-modulation of CD38 with TCR/CD3 is a critical step in signaling processes on T lymphocytes.
ACE inhibitors exert both acute and chronic beneficial effects on cardiac function (e.g remodelling, diastolic dysfunction). We have previously reported that the ACE inhibitor captopril induces selective left ventricular (LV) relaxant effects in the isolated ejecting guinea pig heart. The aim of the present study was to further investigate the mechanism of the captopril-induced changes in early LV relaxation by comparing the effects of two sulphydryl and two non-sulphydryl containing ACE inhibitors in the same experimental preparation. Isolated ejecting guinea pig hearts were studied under conditions of constant loading and heart rate. LV pressure was monitored by a 2F micromanometer-tipped catheter transducer inserted in the LV cavity. The sulphydryl-containing ACE inhibitors captopril and zofenaprilat enhanced early LV relaxation, whereas the non-sulphydryl-containing ACE inhibitors lisinopril and quinaprilat did not. The effects of captopril and zofenaprilat were attenuated both by the nitric oxide-scavenger haemoglobin and the bradykinin B2-kinin receptor antagonist HOE 140. Neither the oxygen free-radical scavenger superoxide dismutase nor the sulphydryl-containing compound N-acetyl cysteine administered together with lisinopril had any effect on LV relaxation. These data demonstrate that inhibition of intra-cardiac ACE activity may acutely modulate LV relaxation through increased activity of the bradykinin-nitric oxide pathway. The presence of a sulphydryl group on the relevant ACE inhibitor appears to be essential for this LV relaxant effect.
CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 expression and metabolism of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) have been characterized in early-passage human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) isolated from reduction mammoplasty tissue of seven individual donors. The level of constitutive microsomal CYP1B1 protein expression was donor dependent (<0.01-1.4 pmol/mg microsomal protein). CYP1B1 expression was substantially induced by exposure of the cells to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) to levels ranging from 2.3 to 16.6 pmol/mg among the seven donors. Extremely low, reproducible levels of constitutive CYP1A1 expression were detectable in three donors (0.03-0.16 pmol/mg microsomal protein). TCDD inductions were larger for CYP1A1, as compared to CYP1B1, demonstrating substantial variability in the induced levels among the donors (0.8-16.5 pmol/mg). Northern and reverse transcriptase PCR analyses corroborate the donor-dependent differences in protein expression, whereby CYP1B1 mRNA (5.2 kb) was constitutively expressed and was highly induced by TCDD (33-fold). The contributions of CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 to the metabolism of DMBA were analyzed using recombinant human CYP1B1 and CYP1A1, as references, in conjunction with antibody-specific inhibition analyses (anti-CYP1B1 and anti-CYP1A1). Constitutive microsomal activity exhibited a profile of regioselective DMBA metabolism that was characteristic of human CYP1B1 (increased proportions of 5,6- and 10,11-DMBA-dihydrodiols), which was inhibited by anti-CYP1B1 (84%) but not by anti-CYP1A1. TCDD-induced HMEC microsomal DMBA metabolism generated the 8,9-dihydrodiol of DMBA as the predominant metabolite, with a regioselectivity similar to that of recombinant human CYP1A1, which was subsequently inhibited by anti-CYP1A1 (79%). A CYP1B1 contribution was indicated by the regioselectivity of residual metabolism and by anti-CYP1B1 inhibition (25%). DMBA metabolism analyses of one of three donors expressing measurable basal expression of CYP1A1 confirmed DMBA metabolism levels equivalent to that from CYP1B1. The HMECs of all donors expressed similar, very high levels of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator protein, suggesting that aryl hydrocarbon receptor and aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator protein expression are not responsible for differences in cytochrome P450 expression. This study indicates that CYP1B1 is an important activator of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the mammary gland when environmental chemical exposures minimally induce CYP1A1. Additionally, certain individuals express low levels of basal CYP1A1 in HMECs, representing a potential risk factor of mammary carcinogenesis through enhanced polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon bioactivation.
CD38 is a nonlineage-restricted type II transmembrane glycoprotein possessing ecto-NAD+ glycohydrolase activity. Because of its unique expression pattern in lymphocyte differentiation, it appears to function as an immunoregulatory molecule. We previously reported that CD38 was specifically induced by all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Here we studied the molecular mechanism of the RA-dependent induction of human CD38. The expression of CD38 mRNA by RA appeared to be caused by the transcriptional stimulation of the gene, since it was blocked by an RNA synthesis inhibitor, but not by a protein synthesis inhibitor. In search of the RA response element (RARE) possibly present in human CD38 gene promoter, we isolated and sequenced the genomic DNA covering the 5'-flanking region, exon 1, and partial intron 1. Transient transfection experiments revealed that the responsiveness to RA was conferred through an RARE consisting of two direct repeat TGACCT-like hexamer motifs with a 5-nucleotide spacer, which was located in the first intron rather than the 5'-flanking region of the CD38 gene. This RARE interacted with heterodimer composed of RA receptor and retinoid X receptor in vitro. Thus, the RA-induced expression of the human CD38 gene was demonstrated to be mediated through the RARE located in the first intron.
FH Helsinki is a deletion of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene that deletes 9.6 kb from intron 15 to exon 18. Screening for mutant transcripts by Northern blot analysis from a patient heterozygous for FH Helsinki revealed two mutant transcripts. One was a transcript where the proximal part of intron 15 was retained in mRNA. The second was a transcript where exon 15 was spliced to nucleotide 4186 of exon 18. Thus, this transcript was generated using the normal donor splice site in intron 15, and a cryptic AG acceptor splice site in exon 18. Translation of the two mutant transcripts is predicted to give nonfunctional proteins, as both the membrane-spanning domain and the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor are deleted. Scanning of the autoradiograms showed that the amounts of each of the two mutant transcripts were approximately 10 times higher than that of the normal transcript in our heterozygous patient. The finding of higher levels of mutant transcripts was confirmed by an allele-specific transcript quantitation method, in which the amount of the two mutant transcripts together was approximately 5 times higher than the amount of the normal transcript. Deletion of destabilizing elements (AU-rich elements) by FH Helsinki are proposed to cause the increased levels of mutant transcripts.
G6PD genotypes were determined in Brazzaville (Congo) on 188 HbSS patients (109 females, 79 males) and 210 controls (115 females and 95 males) with HbAA. DNA samples were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The frequencies of G6PD B, A+ and A- alleles were 56.9, 20.8 and, 22.2% in the patients versus 56.3, 21.2 and, 22.5% in the controls, respectively. The prevalence of G6PD genotypes in HbSS did not differ (p > 0.05) from that found in the controls. Prevalence of G6PD deficiency did not change when patients were stratified by age, suggesting that there is no advantage of the association of G6PD deficiency with HbSS. Red blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin were not modified by the G6PD genotypes, while Hb level was lower in HbSS with G6PD A-. Our study suggests that in Congo, G6PD deficiency does not offer any biological advantage to sicklers.
CD38 is a membrane-associated ecto-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) glycohydrolase that is expressed on multiple hematopoietic cells. The extracellular domain of CD38 can mediate the catalysis of NAD+ to cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose (cADPR), a Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger, adenosine diphosphoribose (ADPR), and nicotinamide. In addition to its enzymatic properties, murine CD38 has been shown to act as a B-cell coreceptor capable of modulating signals through the B-cell antigen receptor. To investigate the in vivo physiological function(s) of this novel class of ectoenzyme we generated mice carrying a null mutation in the CD38 gene. CD38-/- mice showed a complete loss of tissue-associated NAD+ glycohydrolase activity, showing that the classical NAD+ glycohydrolases and CD38 are likely identical. Although murine CD38 is expressed on hematopoietic stem cells as well as on committed progenitors, we show that CD38 is not required for hematopoiesis or lymphopoiesis. However, CD38-/- mice did exhibit marked deficiencies in antibody responses to T-cell-dependent protein antigens and augmented antibody responses to at least one T-cell-independent type 2 polysaccharide antigen. These data suggest that CD38 may play an important role in vivo in regulating humoral immune responses.
LPL directs the body wide distribution of fatty acids derived from circulating triglycerides. This is accomplished by tissue-specific regulation. In adipose tissue, LPLA per gram is higher than in muscle tissue. Eating increases adipose tissue LPLA and may increase blood flow. Exercise greatly increases SM blood flow and LPLA over a longer time frame as compared to the effect of eating on adipose tissue LPLA. The regulation of LPLA occurs at several levels and is better understood in adipose tissue models. In muscle, the study of regulation has been neglected. LPL expression in muscle may be more complex than in adipose tissue owing to the changes in blood flow and metabolism associated with contractile activity, as well as to other factors intrinsic to contraction, such as electrical events and cellular deformation. Sixty to 90 minutes of continuous leg exercise at 60% of VO2 max induces muscle LPL expression, increases LPL mRNA in humans with 4 hours of exercise, and raises immunoreactive mass by 8 hours post-exercise. Within 24 hours, both LPL and mRNA and mass have returned to normal levels. Increased muscle LPL mass following exercise may serve to replenish intramyofibral stores of triglyceride, which are depleted with endurance exercise and are greater in aerobically-trained individuals as compared to untrained individuals. The post-exercise increase in muscle LPL mass coincides with the post-exercise acute fall in circulating triglycerides typically observed in subjects capable of exercising for 60-90 minutes at 60% of VO2 max. The low fasting triglyceride levels often seen in highly trained individuals are due in part to their high levels of muscle LPLA. Both the physiological mediator and the molecular mediator of the exercised-induced induction of muscle LPL expression are known. Hopefully, the next decade will see careful studies aimed at better defining the molecular physiology of LPL expression in muscle.
CD36 is a multifunctional membrane-type receptor glycoprotein that reacts with oxidized low-density lipoprotein and long-chain fatty acid (LCFA). A patient presented with hereditary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and type I CD36 deficiency (neither platelets nor monocytes expressed CD36) but showed no myocardial LCFA accumulation. CD36 was expressed in the capillary endothelial cells of the cardiac muscle of a control subject, while the patient's myocardial capillary endothelial cells were completely CD36-negative. These results suggest that type I CD36 deficiency is closely related to hereditary HCM and lack of myocardial LCFA accumulation.
CD36 is a glycoprotein with an Mr of 88 kDa that is expressed on platelets, monocytes/macrophages, capillary endothelial cells, and adipocytes. We previously demonstrated that CD36 is involved in the uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL) by using CD36-deficient macrophages (J Clin Invest. 1995;96:1859). However, the regulation of CD36 expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages has not been fully elucidated. The current study attempted to clarify the effect of OxLDL and cytokines, both of which are present in atherosclerotic lesions and may play an important role in atherogenesis, on the expression of CD36. A cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry were used to detect CD36 protein. A ribonuclease protection assay was used to measure CD36 mRNA in human monocyte-derived macrophages. The expression of CD36 was increased during the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. Incubation of macrophages with 25 microg/mL OxLDL for 24 hours increased the level of CD36 protein by 56% and that of CD36 mRNA by 58%. Lysophosphatidylcholine did not affect the expression of CD36. The effects of OxLDL were demonstrated in macrophages that had already differentiated to the point where CD36 expression was almost maximal. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) reduced the expression of CD36 in a dose-dependent manner. A concentration of 1000 U/mL IFN-gamma significantly reduced the expression of CD36 protein by 57% and that of CD36 mRNA by 30%. In conclusion, CD36 may be important in the formation of foam cells by induction through its ligand (OxLDL). Moreover, some local factors, such as IFN-gamma, may suppress CD36 expression on macrophages in human atherosclerotic lesions.
CD36 is an 88-kD glycoprotein involved in the cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum-parasitized erythrocytes (PE) to endothelial cells. The molecular mechanisms involved in CD36-dependent cytoadherence were examined by expressing three CD36 homologues (human, murine, and rat) in COS-7 cells and observing their PE-binding characteristics over a pH range of 6.0 to 7.4 and following iodination of these receptors. PE binding to human CD36 was pH dependent, with peak binding at pH 6.8 to 7.0, and binding was unaffected by iodination. In contrast, PE adherence to murine and rat CD36 was insensitive to changes in pH, and iodination significantly reduced binding. We further show that the differences observed in the binding phenotype of human and rodent CD36 can be attributed to a single residue. Site-directed mutagenesis of the histidine at position 242 of human CD36 to tyrosine (found in rodent CD36) conferred the binding phenotype of rodent CD36 onto human CD36. Furthermore, substitution of the tyrosine at position 242 of rat CD36 for histidine conferred the binding phenotype of human CD36 onto rat CD36. These findings suggest that residue 242 is part of, or important to the conformation of, the PE-binding domain of CD36.
"GALT can be subdivided into several compartments: (a) Peyer's patches (PP); (b) lamina propria (LP); and (c) intraepithelial leukocyte (IEL) spaces. The B-cell follicles of PP are quiescent in neonatal and germ-free (GF) adult mice. Germinal centers (GC), including sIgA+ blasts, appear in the B follicles of formerly GF adult mice about 10-14 days after monoassociation with various gut commensal bacteria. The GC wax and wane over about a 3-week period, although the bacterial colonizers remain in the gut at high density. Neonatal mice, born of conventionally reared (CV), immunocompetent mothers, display GC reactions in PP postweaning, although pups of SCID mothers display precocious GC reactions at about 14 days of life. Normally, gut colonization of neonates with segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) leads to explosive development of IgA plasmablasts in LP shortly after weaning. Commensal gut bacteria and the immunocompetency of mothers also appears to control the rate of accumulation of primary B cells from ""virgin"" B cells in neonates. Enteric reovirus infection by the oral route can cause the activation of CD8+ T cells in the interfollicular regions of PP and the appearance of virus-specific precursor cytotoxic T lymphocytes (pCTL) in the IEL spaces. Such oral stimulation can also lead to ""activation"" of both CTL and natural killer (NK) cells in the IEL spaces. More normally, colonization of the gut with SFB also leads to similar activations of NK cells and ""constitutively"" cytotoxic T cells."
AMPD1 genotype, relative fiber type composition, training status, and gender were evaluated as contributing factors to the reported variation in AMP deaminase enzyme activity in healthy skeletal muscle. Multifactorial correlative analyses demonstrate that AMPD1 genotype has the greatest effect on enzyme activity. An AMPD1 mutant allele frequency of 13.7 and a 1.7% incidence of enzyme deficiency was found across 175 healthy subjects. Homozygotes for the AMPD1 normal allele have high enzyme activities, and heterozygotes display intermediate activities. When examined according to genotype, other factors were found to affect variability as follows: AMP deaminase activity in homozygotes for the normal allele exhibits a negative correlation with the relative percentage of type I fibers and training status. Conversely, residual AMP deaminase activity in homozygotes for the mutant allele displays a positive correlation with the relative percentage of type I fibers. Opposing correlations in different homozygous AMPD1 genotypes are likely due to relative fiber-type differences in the expression of AMPD1 and AMPD3 isoforms. Gender also contributes to variation in total skeletal muscle AMP deaminase activity, with normal homozygous and heterozygous women showing only 85-88% of the levels observed in genotype-matched men.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor with sequence homology to protein tyrosine phosphatases and the cytoskeletal protein tensin. mPTEN-mutant mouse embryos display regions of increased proliferation. In contrast, mPTEN-deficient immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibit decreased sensitivity to cell death in response to a number of apoptotic stimuli, accompanied by constitutively elevated activity and phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt, a crucial regulator of cell survival. Expression of exogenous PTEN in mutant cells restores both their sensitivity to agonist-induced apoptosis and normal pattern of PKB/Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, PTEN negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate in cells and dephosphorylates it in vitro. Our results show that PTEN may exert its role as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the PI3'K/PKB/Akt signaling pathway.
CD38 is expressed during early stages of differentiation in normal and leukemic myeloid cells. Recently, CD38 has been shown to participate in intracellular signal transduction pathways following its ligation with CD38-specific mAbs. In this study we report that ligation of CD38 by one such agonistic mAb (IB4) induced proliferation of cultured leukemic cells in vitro. In HL-60, KG-1A, NB4, and OCI-AML-3 myeloid leukemia cell lines, IB4 mAb induced an increase in the proliferating cell fraction as determined by cell number, clonogenic assay, and flow cytometric analysis. The presence of Ab caused a dose-dependent increase in the number of CFU and an increase in cell divisions. HL-60-Dox cells (a HL-60-doxorubicin-resistant cell line), which have no detectable CD38 expression, failed to respond to IB4 mAb. The effect of CD38 ligation on cell growth was also evaluated in freshly isolated leukemic cells from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). A significant increase in the proliferating cell fraction (S+G2M) was observed in 50% of the patients incubated with IB4 mAb. In five of the six AML patients, anti-CD38 mAb stimulated the proliferation of AML colony-forming cells. These results suggest that ligation of CD38 can induce the proliferation of leukemic cells and may play a role in the propagation of leukemic cell clones in certain cohorts of AML patients.
ACE inhibitors are valuable and effective drugs in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction and nephropathy. Angiotensin receptor antagonists, which have recently been introduced into clinical practice, have the potential to replace ACE inhibitor therapy in many patients.
CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in many vertebrate cells. It is a bifunctional ectoenzyme that catalyzes both the synthesis of Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD+ and the degradation of cADPR to ADP-ribose by means of its ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR-hydrolase activities, respectively. The cyclase also converts NGD+ to cyclic GDP-ribose (cGDPR), which is refractory to cADPR-hydrolase. cADPR, but not cGDPR, is a potent calcium mobilizer from intracellular stores. It has been demonstrated to be a new second messenger involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis in many cell types, from plants to mammals. The number of physiological processes shown to be regulated by cADPR is steadily increasing. A topological paradox exists because ectocellularly generated cADPR acts intracellularly. Here we demonstrate that the catalytic functioning of CD38 is accompanied by a cADPR (cGDPR) -transporting activity across natural and artificial membranes. In resealed membranes from CD38(+) human erythrocytes, transport of catalytically generated cADPR or cGDPR was saturation dependent and occurred against a concentration gradient. Likewise, CD38-reconstituted proteoliposomes were active in concentrating NAD+ (NGD+) -derived cADPR (cGDPR) inside the vesicle compartment. Moreover, the cADPR-transporting activity in CD38 proteoliposomes prevented the hydrolase-catalyzed degradation to ADPR that occurs conversely with detergent-solubilized CD38, resulting in selective influx of cADPR. In the CD38 proteoliposomes, catalytically active CD38 exhibited monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric structures. In CD38 sense- but not in antisense-transfected HeLa cells, externally added NAD+ resulted in significant, transient increases in cytosolic calcium. These data suggest that transmembrane juxtaposition of two or four CD38 monomers can generate a catalytically active channel for selective formation and influx of cADPR (cGDPR) to reach cADPR-responsive intracellular calcium stores.
CBS human colon carcinoma cells are poorly tumorigenic in athymic nude mice, whereas FET colon carcinoma cells are non-tumorigenic. Both cell lines have well differentiated properties in tissue culture. Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) was ectopically expressed by stable transfection of a TGF-alpha cDNA under repressible tetracycline control. The TGF-alpha-transfected cells showed enhanced clonal initiation and shortened lag phase growth in tissue culture without an alteration in doubling time in exponential phase relative to untransfected cells. Furthermore, the TGF-alpha transfectants showed increased independence from exogenous growth factors in clonal growth assays and induction of DNA synthesis after release from quiescence. Growth factor independence was associated with sustained epidermal growth factor receptor activation in quiescent TGF-alpha-transfected cells and the requirement of exogenous insulin for stimulation of quiescent cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Higher cloning, reduced lag time in tissue, and the acquisition of growth factor independence for DNA synthesis without a change in doubling time of TGF-alpha-transfected cells indicate that autocrine TGF-alpha functions by facilitating re-entry into the cell cycle from sub-optimal growth states rather than promoting or controlling the proliferation of actively cycling cells. The modulation of growth regulation by autocrine TGF-alpha was associated with increased malignant properties as TGF-alpha transfectants showed increased tumorigenicity in athymic nude mice. The administration of tetracycline reversed the effects of TGF-alpha expression in these cells both in vivo and in vitro, indicating that the alterations of the biological properties were due to the expression of TGF-alpha. Since these cells are continuously grown in a completely chemically defined medium without serum supplementation, it was possible to assign the mechanism underlying the generation of growth factor independence to the replacement of a requirement for exogenous insulin in parental cells by autocrine TGF-alpha.
CYP11B1 (11beta-hydroxylase) and CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) are 93% identical mitochondrial enzymes that both catalyze 11beta-hydroxylation of steroid hormones. CYP11B2 has the additional 18-hydroxylase and 18-oxidase activities required for conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone. These two additional C18 conversions can be catalyzed by CYP11B1 if serine-288 and valine-320 are replaced by the corresponding CYP11B2 residues, glycine and alanine. Here we show that such a hybrid enzyme also catalyzes conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, 18-hydroxycortisol, and 18-oxocortisol. These latter two steroids are present at elevated levels in individuals with glucocorticoid suppressible hyperaldosteronism (GSH) and some forms of primary aldosteronism. Their production by the recombinant CYP11B enzyme is enhanced by substitution of further amino acids encoded in exons 4, 5, and 6 of CYP11B2. A converted CYP11B1 gene, containing these exons from CYP11B2, would be regulated like CYP11B1, yet encode an enzyme with the activities of CYP11B2, thus causing GSH or essential hypertension. In a sample of 103 low renin hypertensive patients, 218 patients with primary aldosteronism, and 90 normotensive individuals, we found a high level of conversion of CYP11B genes and four cases of GSH caused by unequal crossing over but no gene conversions of the type expected to cause GSH.
CD36 is a multifunctional cell-surface receptor that binds adhesion molecules such as thrombospondin-1 and collagen and modified lipids and/or lipoproteins. It participates in cellular uptake of photoreceptor outer segments and scavenging of apoptotic cells and oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL). Recognition and internalization of Ox-LDL by mononuclear phagocytes may play an important role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. We have utilized a series of recombinant bacterial glutathione S-transferase/CD36 fusion proteins that span nearly all of the CD36 molecule to characterize the structural domain on CD36 that recognizes Ox-LDL. We found that the Ox-LDL-binding domain is different from the thrombospondin-1-binding domain located at amino acids 93-120. A fusion protein containing the region extending from amino acids 5 to 143 formed specific, saturable, and reversible complexes with Ox-LDL. As with intact CD36, binding was blocked by excess unlabeled Ox-LDL and antibodies to CD36. The stoichiometry and affinity of the fusion protein for Ox-LDL were similar to those of the intact protein. We also demonstrated that this fusion protein competitively inhibited binding of Ox-LDL to purified platelet CD36 and to CD36 expressed on peripheral blood monocytes and CD36 cDNA-transfected melanoma cells. The use of smaller peptides and fusion proteins including those spanning amino acids 28-93 and 5-93 has further narrowed the binding site to a region from amino acids 28 to 93, although participation of a sequence in the noncontiguous region 120-155 cannot be excluded. This study, for the first time, demonstrates unique regions of the scavenger receptor CD36 that bind the Ox-LDL ligand. Our structural analysis of the receptor provides information as to potential control of the trafficking of modified lipoproteins into the blood vessel wall.
NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein) was the first protein to be isolated as a crucial factor in intracellular membrane-fusion events, such as the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane during neurotransmission. Although the activation of membrane SNARE proteins for subsequent fusion is clearly a primary role of NSF, recent studies have provided surprising evidence that NSF also interacts with glutamate receptors at the postsynaptic membrane in a way that does not seem to involve SNAREs. These results suggest that NSF might act as a molecular chaperone not only on SNAREs but also of other proteins.
CYP2E1 knockout mice (cyp2e1-/-) were used to investigate the involvement of CYP2E1 in the development of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity. Male cyp2e1-/- and wild-type (cyp2e1+/+) mice were given a single i.p. injection of 1 ml/kg (= 1.59 g/kg) CCl4 and 24 h later liver injury was assessed by elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities and histopathology. No significant increases in serum ALT and AST activities were observed in cyp2e1-/- mice when compared to wild-type counterparts after CCl4 exposure. No detectable abnormality in liver histology was found in cyp2e1-/- mice after CCl4 exposure. In contrast, CCl4 treatment resulted in 442- and 125-fold increases in serum ALT and AST activities, respectively, in wild-type mice. Consistent with the results of serum ALT and AST activities, severe hepatic damage was noted in livers of wild-type mice, indicating the importance of CYP2E1 in mediating the hepatic damage following CCl4 exposure in these mice. In addition, a dramatic decrease in CYP2E1-catalyzed p-nitrophenol activity and complete loss of immunoreactive CYP2E1 were observed in wild-type mice after CCl4 treatment, suggesting that CYP2E1 was degraded during the process of CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity. These studies conclusively demonstrate that CYP2E1 is the major factor involved in the CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in mice.
LBR (lamin B receptor) is an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane encoded by a gene on human chromosome 1q42.1. LBR has a nucleoplasmic, amino-terminal domain of approximately 200 amino acids followed by a carboxyl-terminal domain similar in sequence to yeast and plant sterol reductases. We have determined the primary structures of two human proteins with strong sequence similarity to the carboxyl-terminal domain of LBR and sterol reductases. Their genes have recently been assigned the symbols TM7SF2 and DHCR7. TM7SF2 mRNA is most predominantly expressed in heart and DHCR7 mRNA mostly in liver and brain. Whereas LBR is localized to the inner nuclear membrane, these two related proteins are in the endoplasmic reticulum. The TM7SF2 gene contains 10 coding exons, and its intron positions are exactly conserved in the part of the LBR gene encoding its carboxyl-terminal domain. Intron positions in the DHCR7 gene are also similar. Both of these new LBR-like genes are on chromosome 11q13. These results describe a human gene family encoding proteins of the inner nuclear membrane and endoplasmic reticulum that function in nuclear organization and/or sterol metabolism.
STS markers spanning the AZFc region of human Y Chromosome (Chr) were used to isolate a series of 14 P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) clones covering at least 560 kb of DNA. End clone analysis of these PAC clones was used to derive 10 new STS markers. Together with other markers mapped to the region, an STS content analysis was used to assemble these PAC clones into three distinct contigs. A minimum tiling path of ten PAC clones was subjected to exon trapping to identify potentially new genes mapping to the AZFs region. In all, 39 potential exons were isolated, including 2 exons from the DAZ gene, 3 exons from the BPY2 gene, 2 exons from the PRY gene, and 1 exon from a member of the RBM II gene family; all these genes have been shown previously to map to the AZFc region. One further exon was found that shows homology to the DFFRY gene, which maps to Yq11. 2, indicating that there may be a further copy of this gene or a pseudogene in the distal Yq euchromatin. The majority of the remaining potential exons appear to be novel, suggesting that additional genes lie in the AZFc region. Mapping of these exons by PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrids has shown that six of these exons are homologous to autosomal sequences, and five to sequences on the X Chr. RT-PCR analysis of primary cDNA from adult testis, brain, liver, and skeletal muscle mRNA has shown that 11 of the novel exons are expressed in one or a combination of these tissues, indicating that they form parts of genuine transcripts.
CYP2D6 genotyping (CYP2D6*3, CYP2D6*4, CYP2D6*5, CYP2D6*13, CYP2D6*16 alleles and gene duplications) was previously performed on 1053 Caucasian and African-American lung cancer cases and control individuals and no significant difference in allele frequencies between cases and control individuals detected. We have carried out additional genotyping (CYP2D6*6, CYP2D6*7, CYP2D6*8, CYP2D6*9, CYP2D6*10, CYP2D6*17 alleles) and debrisoquine phenotyping on subgroups from this study to assess phenotype-genotype relationships. African-Americans showed significant differences from Caucasians with respect to frequency of defective CYP2D6 alleles, particularly CYP2D6*4 and CYP2D6*5. The CYP2D6*17 allele occurred at a frequency of 0.26 among 87 African-Americans and appeared to explain higher average metabolic ratios among African-Americans compared with Caucasians. CYP2D6*6, CYP2D6*8, CYP2D6*9 and CYP2D6*10 were rare in both ethnic groups but explained approximately 40% of higher than expected metabolic ratios among extensive metabolizers. Among individuals phenotyped with debrisoquine, 32 out of 359 were in the poor metabolizer range with 24 of these (75%) also showing two defective CYP2D6 alleles. Additional single strand conformational polymorphism analysis screening of samples showing large phenotype-genotype discrepancies resulted in the detection of three novel polymorphisms. If subjects taking potentially interfering drugs were excluded, this additional screening enabled the positive identification of 88% of phenotypic poor metabolizers by genotyping. This sensitivity was comparable with that of phenotyping, which identified 90% of those with two defective alleles as poor metabolizers.
CFTR Is a Conductance Regulator as well as a Chloride Channel. Physiol. Rev. 79, Suppl.: S145-S166, 1999. - Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene family. Although CFTR has the structure of a transporter that transports substrates across the membrane in a nonconductive manner, CFTR also has the intrinsic ability to conduct Cl- at much higher rates, a function unique to CFTR among this family of ABC transporters. Because Cl- transport was shown to be lost in cystic fibrosis (CF) epithelia long before the cloning of the CF gene and CFTR, CFTR Cl- channel function was considered to be paramount. Another equally valid perspective of CFTR, however, derives from its membership in a family of transporters that transports a multitude of different substances from chemotherapeutic drugs, to amino acids, to glutathione conjugates, to small peptides in a nonconductive manner. Moreover, at least two members of this ABC transporter family (mdr-1, SUR) can regulate other ion channels in the membrane. More simply, ABC transporters can regulate somehow the function of other cellular proteins or cellular functions. This review focuses on a plethora of studies showing that CFTR also regulates other ion channel proteins. It is the hope of the authors that the reader will take with him or her the message that CFTR is a conductance regulator as well as a Cl- channel.
CYP2D6 polymorphism of clinical relevance occurs with variable frequency in different ethnic groups. Since this polymorphism has not been studied in a North Indian population, the present study was undertaken.
CA1 pyramids were studied intracellularly in rat hippocampal slices to establish the contribution of excitatory amino acid (EAA) and GABA(A) receptors to the depolarizations induced by brief (< 10 min) anoxic episodes. An increase of the amplitude of the depolarizations evoked by successive anoxic episodes occurred with KCl (n=4 cells), not with K-acetate-filled (n=3) recording electrodes. Moreover, with K-acetate-filled electrodes the anoxic depolarization amplitude was reduced, but not abolished by EAA receptor antagonists (n=14). The residual anoxic depolarizations were blocked by a GABA(A) receptor antagonist (n=5) and decreased by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (n=4). We conclude that the anoxic depolarizations generated by CA1 pyramids are caused by the activation of EAA along with GABA(A) receptors leading to an increased membrane conductance to both Cl- and HCO3-.
PTEN is a novel tumour suppressor gene that encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase with homology to adhesion molecules tensin and auxillin. It recently has been suggested that PTEN dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3, 4,5)P3], which mediates growth factor-induced activation of intracellular signalling, in particular through the serine-threonine kinase Akt, a known cell survival-promoting factor. PTEN has been mapped to 10q23.3, a region disrupted in several human tumours including haematological malignancies. We have analysed PTEN in a series of primary acute leukaemias and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) as well as in cell lines. We have also examined whether a correlation could be found between PTEN and Akt levels in these samples. We show here that the majority of cell lines studied carries PTEN abnormalities. At the structural level, we found mutations and hemizygous deletions in 40% of these cell lines, while a smaller number of primary haematological malignancies, in particular NHLs, carries PTEN mutations. Moreover, one-third of the cell lines had low PTEN transcript levels, and 60% of these samples had low or absent PTEN protein, which could not be attributed to gene silencing by hypermethylation. In addition, we found that PTEN and phosphorylated Akt levels are inversely correlated in the large majority of the examined samples. These findings suggest that PTEN plays a role in the pathogenesis of haematological malignancies and that it might be inactivated through a wider range of mechanisms than initially considered. The finding that PTEN levels inversely correlate with phosphorylated Akt supports the hypothesis that PTEN regulates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3and suggests a role for PTEN in apoptosis.
SCP2 and SCP3 are major protein components of the lateral elements (LEs) of synaptonemal complexes (SCs) of the rat, with Mrs of 173, 000 and 30,000. We performed a detailed immunocytochemical comparison of the localization of SCP2 and SCP3 within SCs at the electron microscopic level. The ultrastructural localization of SCP2 and SCP3 was analyzed by immunogold labeling of two types of preparations, namely surface-spread spermatocytes and ultrathin sections of Lowicryl-embedded testicular tissue of the rat. For each of the antisera used, the distribution of immunogold label over SCs in surface-spread spermatocytes differed significantly from the distribution of label on sections. We attributed this difference to artifacts caused by the surface-spreading technique, and therefore we relied on sections for the precise localization of epitopes. On sections, the distribution of label obtained with two antisera against nonoverlapping, widely separated fragments of SCP2 did not differ significantly. There was a small but significant difference between the labeling pattern obtained with an anti-SCP3 serum and the pattern obtained with either of the two antisera against fragments of SCP2; although for all three antisera the peak of the immunogold label coincided with the center of the LE, the distributions of label obtained with the antisera against fragments of SCP2 were asymmetrical, with a shoulder at the inner side of the LE, whereas the distribution of label obtained with anti-SCP3 serum was symmetrical. Furthermore, we observed fuzzy connections between the LEs that were labeled by anti-SCP2 but not anti-SCP3 antibodies. It is possible that labeling of these fuzzy bridges caused the shoulder in the gold label distributions obtained with anti-SCP2 antibodies.
CYP2D6 is a polymorphically expressed enzyme with two phenotypes. Poor metabolizers lack the enzyme caused by inactivating mutations in the CYP2D6 gene and extensive metabolizers have at least one active CYP2D6 gene. Extensive metabolizers with very high capacity for CYP2D6 dependent drug metabolisms are termed ultrarapid metabolizers and carry alleles with duplicated, multi duplicated or amplified CYP2D6 genes. In the present study, we examined the frequency of CYP2D6 gene duplications in a Danish population and validated a long polymerase chain reaction method for identification of ultrarapid metabolizers. Sixty individuals having a metabolic ratio for sparteine at or below 0.15 were selected and a control group of 53 individuals with a metabolic ratio between 0.16 and 12.4 was used. Based on EcoRI restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, eight individuals were found with a duplicated CYP2D6 gene, whereas using a long polymerase chain reaction method, nine individuals with a 3.6 kb fragment indicative of two CYP2D6 genes in tandem were found among the 60 individuals with a low metabolic ratio. No gene duplication was found in the control group or in any individuals with a metabolic ratio > 0.14. Based on these results, we estimate the frequency of individuals with CYP2D6 duplication in the Danish population to be 0.8%, which is comparable to the frequency in the Swedish and the German populations, but considerably lower than in Spanish or African populations. We conclude that the long polymerase chain reaction assay is simple and reliable for detection of duplications of the CYP2D6 gene.
CD36 is a multifunctional, 88 kDa glycoprotein that is expressed on platelets and monocytes/macrophages. CD36 also has high homology with the long-chain fatty acid (LFA) transporter in the myocardium. Although platelet and monocyte CD36 levels can indicate a CD36 deficiency, they cannot predict specific clinical manifestations in the myocardium of a given person. We examined the hypothesis that a deficiency in LFA transport augments myocardial glucose uptake in patients with a type I CD36 deficiency.
CD38 is a 42-kDa type II transmembrane glycoprotein that has been shown to catalyze the synthesis and hydrolysis of cyclic ADP-ribose, a metabolite with well-known calcium mobilizing properties independent of IP3. In this report, characterization and localization of CD38 in the porcine and rat eyes were carried out. Western blot analysis of a purified microsomal eye extract detected a single 42-kDa protein band characteristic of CD38. Subcellular fractionation studies indicate the presence of ADP-ribosyl cyclase and NADase activities in the nuclear, membrane and microsomal fractions. Immunohistochemical staining of the rat retina showed the expression of CD38 in three distinct layers: the ganglion cell layer, inner nuclear layer and the pigmented epithelium. In the lens, the lenticular epithelium and lens cells were also immunoreactive for CD38 while in the ciliary body, both the pigmented and non-pigmented epithelium also showed the presence of CD38. For the first time, the presence of CD38/ADP-ribosyl cyclase was detected in the vertebrate eye.
PC cell-derived growth factor (PCDGF) is an 88 kDa glycosylated protein isolated from a highly tumorigenic mouse teratoma derived cell line which is similar to the epithelin/granulin precursor. Using Northern blot and western blot analyses, we detect the expression of PCDGF mRNA and protein in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. We show that 17-beta-estradiol stimulates PCDGF mRNA and protein expression in a time and dose-dependent manner. The stimulation of PCDGF expression by 17-beta-estradiol was observed as early as 4 hours and reached a maximum at 12 hours. Maximal stimulation of PCDGF mRNA and protein expression by 17-beta-estradiol was observed at a concentration of 10(-8) M. The stimulation of PCDGF expression by 17-beta-estradiol was completely inhibited by treatment with actinomycin D and with the antiestrogen 4-hydroxytamoxifen. The stimulation of PCDGF expression was also demonstrated in another human estrogen-responsive cell line T47D. The results presented here provide evidence of a novel estradiol responsive gene product in human breast cancer cell lines and give information about the hormonal control of epithelin/granulin (PCDGF) expression in these cells.
CD38 is a 46-kDa type II transmembrane glycoprotein that catalyses the synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD+. cADPR is a second messenger known to regulate intracellular Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release (CICR). A recent study has revealed that CD38 in Namalwa B cells undergoes internalization upon exposure to external NAD+. In this study, recombinant rat CD38 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and the possibility of the protein to undergo internalization upon exposure to a substrate analog NADP+ was examined. It was found that such treatment of CHO cells resulted in a decrease of ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity, as well as immunofluorescence of CD38 on the cell surface. The same treatment of CHO cells also resulted in intracellular clustering of CD38 molecules as revealed by confocal microscopic analysis. The internalized CD38 was purified using a streptavidin/biotin-based method and was found to exhibit both ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase activities. On immunoblot, the internalized CD38 appeared as a monomer of 46 kDa under reducing condition of SDS-PAGE. Our data demonstrate that NADP+ can efficiently induce internalization of CD38, a process that may be important in the production of cADPR intracellularly to regulate CICR.
PTEN is a novel tumour-suppressor gene located on chromosomal band 10q23.3. This region displays frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in a variety of human neoplasms including breast carcinomas. The detection of PTEN mutations in Cowden disease and in breast carcinoma cell lines suggests that PTEN may be involved in mammary carcinogenesis. We here report a mutational analysis of tumour specimens from 103 primary breast carcinomas and constitutive DNA from 25 breast cancer families. The entire coding region of PTEN was screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing using intron-based primers. No germline mutations could be identified in the breast cancer families and only one sporadic carcinoma carried a PTEN mutation at one allele. In addition, all sporadic tumours were analysed for homozygous deletions by differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for allelic loss using the microsatellite markers D10S215, D10S564 and D10S573. No homozygous deletions were detected and only 10 out of 94 informative tumours showed allelic loss in the PTEN region. These results suggest that PTEN does not play a major role in breast cancer formation.
CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed by many cell types including lymphocytes. Signaling through CD38 on B lymphocytes can mediate B cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine secretion. Additionally, coligation of CD38 and the B cell Ag receptor can greatly augment B cell Ag receptor responses. Interestingly, the extracellular domain of CD38 catalyzes the conversion of NAD+ into nicotinamide, ADP-ribose (ADPR), and cyclic ADPR (cADPR). cADPR can induce intracellular calcium release in an inositol trisphosphate-independent manner and has been hypothesized to regulate CD38-mediated signaling. We demonstrate that replacement of the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane domains of CD38 did not impair CD38 signaling, coreceptor activity, or enzyme activity. In contrast, independent point mutations in the extracellular domain of CD38 dramatically impaired signal transduction. However, no correlation could be found between CD38-mediated signaling and the capacity of CD38 to catalyze an enzyme reaction and produce cADPR, ADPR, and/or nicotinamide. Instead, we propose that CD38 signaling and coreceptor activity in vitro are regulated by conformational changes induced in the extracellular domain upon ligand/substrate binding, rather than on actual turnover or generation of products.
OGT 719 is a novel p.o. bioavailable nucleoside analogue in which galactose is incorporated onto the fluoropyrimidine moiety of the cytotoxic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). OGT 719 has been designed to reduce the systemic toxicity normally associated with 5-FU while retaining activity against disease localized in the liver, in which it may be preferentially localized through the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R). We report studies confirming the activity of OGT 719 in inhibiting growth of metastatic human colorectal tumors in the liver of nude mice. The human colorectal cancer cell line C170HM2 readily forms liver metastases in vivo. Oral administration of 1500 mg/kg/day OGT 719 inhibited liver tumor burden by 95% compared with vehicle control, without any observable signs of toxicity. When the tumor burden was increased and the same OGT 719 treatment was compared with a standard clinical dose regimen of 25 mg/kg/day 5-FU/leucovorin given i.v., both treatments were equally efficacious, although 5-FU/leucovorin treatment started 7 days earlier. In contrast to 5-FU, OGT 719 is p.o. bioavailable and has a plasma half-life between 1.5 and 3 h. Several colorectal cancer cell lines express the asialoglycoprotein receptor, although no significant levels can be detected in C170HM2 cells, consistent with the observation that OGT 719 is approximately 3 log orders of magnitude less potent in vitro than 5-FU. Flux through thymidylate synthase, as measured by 3H release from [3H]dUrd, was inhibited by OGT 719 at 4 h. The notable difference in the potency of OGT 719 efficacy on C170HM2 cells in vitro and in vivo supports our model of liver-specific activation of OGT 719. As our data suggest, OGT 719 may significantly inhibit growth of metastatic colorectal tumors in the liver in vivo. This hypothesis is presently being explored in clinical trials for primary hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal liver metastases.
CP is a systemic disease of presumed autoimmune etiology that may involve the skin, conjunctiva, or any mucosal surface. As many patients present with ocular symptoms, ophthalmologists must inquire about signs of potential life-threatening esophageal and laryngeal involvement. Ocular involvement is a bilateral chronic cicatricial conjunctivitis that may result in fornix foreshortening, symblepharon formation, trichiasis, and entropion and keratinization of the eyelids and conjunctiva. These mechanical factors are responsible for progressive scarring and vascularization of the ocular surface. Successful systemic treatment of the autoimmune disease is now available; however, the condition often is not diagnosed until significant structural damage to the ocular adnexa has occurred. Our ability to rehabilitate visually patients with advanced disease by penetrating keratoplasty and associated techniques remains extremely limited. Hence, the focus of treatment in OCP should be on early detection of the disease, including conjunctival biopsy, prompt systemic treatment to prevent disease progression, and early aggressive treatment of secondary eyelid and conjunctival abnormalities to avoid the blinding keratopathy so prevalent in this disease.
CA1 pyramidal cells were voltage clamped, and GABA was applied to individual cells with a modified U-tube, rapid drug application system. With Vh = -50 mV, inward currents elicited by 10 microM GABA were inhibited by GABAA receptor (GABAR) antagonists and were baclofen insensitive, suggesting that GABA actions on isolated CA1 pyramidal cells were GABAR mediated. GABA concentration-response curves averaged from all cells were fitted best with a two-site equation, indicating the presence of at least two GABA binding sites, a higher-affinity site (EC50-1 = 11.0 microM) and a lower-affinity site (EC50-2 = 334.2 microM), on two or more populations of cells. The effects of GABAR allosteric modulators on peak concentration-dependent GABAR currents were complex and included monophasic (loreclezole) or multiphasic (diazepam) enhancement, mixed enhancement/inhibition (DMCM, zolpidem) or multiphasic inhibition (zinc). Monophasic (70% of cells) or biphasic (30% of cells) enhancement of GABAR currents by diazepam suggested three different sites on GABARs (EC50-1 =1.8 nM; EC50-2 = 75.8 nM; EC50-3 = 275.9 nM) revealing GABAR heterogeneity. The imidazopyridine zolpidem enhanced GABAR currents in 70% of cells with an EC50 = 222.5 nM, suggesting a predominance of moderate affinity alpha2 (or alpha3-) subtype-containing BZ Type IIA receptors. A small fraction of cells (10%) had a high affinity for zolpidem, something that is suggestive of alpha1 subtype-containing BZ Type I receptors. The remaining 30% of cells were insensitive to or inhibited by zolpidem, suggesting the presence of alpha5 subtype-containing BZ Type IIB receptors. Whether BZ Type I and Type II receptors coexist could not be determined. The beta-carboline methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) inhibited GABAR currents in all cells at midnanomolar concentrations, but in addition, potentiated GABAR currents in some cells at low nanomolar concentrations, characterizing two groups of cells, the latter likely due to functional assembly of alpha5betaxgamma2GABARs. In all cells, GABAR currents were moderately sensitive (EC50 = 9 microM) to loreclezole, consistent with a relatively greater beta3 subtype, than beta1 subtype, subunit mRNA expression. Two populations of cells were identified based on their sensitivities to zinc(IC50 = 28 and 182 microM), suggesting the presence of at least two GABAR isoforms including alpha5beta3gamma2 GABARs. Consistent with the heterogeneity of expression of GABAR subunit mRNA and protein in the hippocampus and based on their differential responses to GABA and to allosteric modulators, distinct populations of CA1 pyramidal cells likely express multiple, functional GABAR isoforms.
ACE (kininase II) inhibitors have been shown to exert their beneficial cardiovascular effects via the inhibition of both angiotensin II formation and bradykinin breakdown. Because recent evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors may also interfere with B2 kinin receptor signaling and thus enhance the vascular response to bradykinin, we examined whether the distribution of B2 kinin receptors within the plasma membrane of native endothelial cells is affected by an ACE inhibitor.
CA1 basket cells are identifiable by an axonal arbour largely confined to, and spanning, the entire depth of stratum pyramidale where they innervate pyramidal somata and proximal dendrites. Basket cells display a range of electrophysiological properties and the inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) they elicit in pyramidal cells vary widely in duration. To determine whether these parameters are correlated, we used paired intracellular recordings, with biocytin filling, in pyramidal cells of adult hippocampal slices, and studied gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) IPSPs (n = 43) elicited by putative basket cells (n = 35) with axons largely confined to stratum pyramidale in simultaneously recorded pyramidal cells. Fast-spiking interneurons elicited relatively brief IPSPs, while IPSPs elicited by burst-firing cells were amongst the slowest. Regular spiking interneurons elicited fast and slow GABAA IPSPs, but any one interneuron elicited IPSPs with remarkably similar durations in two to four pyramidal targets. However, with different types of target for a single putative basket cell, IPSPs elicited in postsynaptic interneurons were briefer than in pyramidal cells. Vertical oriens cells with somata in stratum oriens and a narrow, sparse axonal arbour in stratum pyramidale in transverse hippocampal slices, elicited IPSPs whose rise times and half widths clustered around intermediate values. Durations of IPSPs in pyramidal cells thus correlate, to a degree, with the physiological properties of presynaptic basket cells. The seven-fold range of durations observed (10-70 ms half widths) may underlie contributions made by different basket cells to hippocampal rhythms of different frequencies.
CYP2D6 mediates both alpha-hydroxylation and O-demethylation of metoprolol. In Chinese subjects, CYP2D6*1 (the wild-type) alleles are relatively uncommon. Subjects with P34S (C188-->T188) and S486T (G4268-->C4268) mutations (CYP2D6J or CYP2D6*10A) are more frequently seen. Recently, the CYP2D6*2 (CYP2D6L) genotype that results in R296C (C2938-->T2938) and S486T mutations was also found important. In this study, metoprolol pharmacokinetics was investigated in subjects of these 3 major genotypes.
CS mice, an inbred strain, showed two distinctive characteristics in the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity: (1) large variation in the freerunning period, and (2) spontaneous rhythm splitting under continuous darkness. In the splitting rhythm there was a positive correlation between the freerunning period of the evening component and the activity time of the morning component. The phase-shifting effect of a 15-min light pulse was examined on the two activity components of the splitting rhythm. There were significant differences in the amount of light-induced phase response between the two components. A light pulse during the late subjective night induced a phase advance shift only in the morning component, while a light pulse during the early subjective night induced a phase delay shift only in the evening component. These results indicate functional diversities of the two activity components in the circadian locomotor rhythm of CS mice, and suggest that the circadian system in CS mice consists of two mutually coupled oscillators which have different circadian periods and different responsiveness to light. The CS mouse is a useful model to explore a genetic background of oscillator coupling in the circadian system of nocturnal rodents.
CD36 has been reported to be a receptor for oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL). In our previous study, the uptake of Ox-LDL in CD36-deficient macrophages was reduced by approximately 50% compared with that in control macrophages, suggesting an important role of CD36 as a receptor for Ox-LDL in humans. In the current study, we examined the immunohistochemical localization of CD36 in human aorta in comparison with that of scavenger receptor class A type I and type II (SRA). Cryostat sections were made from aortic tissues. For immunohistochemical staining, the following antibodies were used: (1) FA6-152, anti-CD36 antibody, and (2) SRI-2, which recognizes both type I and type II SRAs. Immunohistochemical staining for CD36 and SRA was performed using labeled streptavidin method. In macrophages scattered in aortic walls without atherosclerotic lesions, the expression of CD36 was hardly observed, whereas that of SRA was detected weakly but consistently. In contrast, in atherosclerotic lesions, macrophages around the core region showed a weak immunoreactivity to CD36 and a strong immunoreactivity to SRA. Furthermore, lipid-laden macrophages, which mainly existed in the core region, had a strongly positive immunoreactivity to CD36, but a low or moderate level of immunoreactivity to SRA. The distributions of CD36 and SRA were different from each other, and especially foamed, large-sized macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques tended to more abundantly express CD36 protein. These data demonstrate, for the first time, that the expression of both CD36 and SRA might be differentially regulated in aortic walls, and might play different roles in the formation of foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions.
PTEN is a candidate tumor suppressor gene identified on human chromosome 10q23.3 that is frequently mutated or deleted in 30% to 44% of glioblastomas. Transient expression study of PTEN in glioma cells indicates that PTEN plays an important role in cellular proliferation, tumorigenicity, cell migration, and focal adhesions. In this study, we examined the biological consequences on U87MG glioma cells after stable gene transfer of wild-type PTEN. Cells stably expressing wild-type PTEN protein were found to have suppressed proliferation, as determined by cell counting and Ki-67 staining, as well as inhibited anchorage-independent growth. The PTEN-expressing cells also showed higher expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and changed morphologically from spindle-shaped to elongated cell bodies with multiple slender processes, suggesting that these cells have undergone differentiation. In addition, telomerase activity decreased more than 10-fold in PTEN-expressing cells when compared with control cells. More importantly, apoptosis was detected in about 5% of PTEN-expressing cells, representing a 17-fold (p < 0.01) increase over the control cells. Taken together, these results suggest that PTEN plays an important role in regulation of cell homeostasis by maintaining a balance between proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.
UCP2 and UCP3 are two recently cloned genes with high sequence homology to the gene for uncoupling protein (UCP)-1, which regulates thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. In the context of the current debate about whether UCP2 and UCP3 in the skeletal muscle may also function as mediators of thermogenesis or as regulators of lipids as fuel substrate, we have examined their mRNA expressions in rat gastrocnemius muscle in response to dietary manipulations known to differentially affect thermogenesis during the phase of weight recovery after starvation. Compared with ad libitum-fed control rats, the refeeding of isocaloric amounts of a low-fat (high-carbohydrate) diet resulted in lower energy expenditure and lower mRNA levels of muscle UCP2 and UCP3. This downregulation of UCP homologs was abolished by the refeeding of a high-fat diet, even though energy expenditure was significantly lower during refeeding on the high-fat than on the low-fat diet. Furthermore, major alterations in the fatty acid composition of the refeeding diet in favor of n-6 polyunsaturated or medium-chain fatty acids resulted in significant increases in energy expenditure, but with no significant changes in the expression of skeletal muscle UCP homologs. Regression analysis of gastrocnemius UCP mRNA levels against parameters that included body composition, energy expenditure, and plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFAs), insulin, and glucose as well as the increase in plasma glucose after a glucose load, revealed that only the latter (an index of insulin resistance) could explain the variability in muscle UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA expressions (r = 0.41, P < 0.02; r = 0.45, P < 0.01, respectively). Taken together, these data are at variance with a role for skeletal muscle UCP2 and UCP3 in dietary regulation (or modulation) of thermogenesis. However, they are consistent with the notion that these UCP homologs may function as regulators of lipids as fuel substrate and raise the possibility that high-fat induced upregulation of muscle UCP2 and UCP3 may be more closely linked to insulin resistance than to changes in circulating FFAs.
CD36 and LIMPII analogous-1 (CLA-1), a human homolog of the rodent scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1), binds high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and mediates the selective uptake of HDL cholesterol ester (CE) by cultured transfected cells. CLA-1 is strongly expressed in steroidogenic tissues, including the adrenal gland, suggesting that CLA-1 plays a role in providing substrates for steroidogenesis. To address this, we established an adrenocortical cell line that highly expresses CLA-1. These cells increased CE uptake from HDL to 140.5% of the level in mock-transfected cells. After incubation of the transfected cells with HDL, corticosterone secretion from CLA-1-transfected cells increased to about two times the level in mock-transfected cells. These results indicate the possibility that CLA-1 (a close structural homolog of SR-B1)-mediated uptake of HDL CE may be a significant source of precursor cholesterol for steroidogenesis in humans as it is in mice.
ACE inhibitors may not adequately suppress deleterious levels of angiotensin II in patients with heart failure. An angiotensin receptor blocker added to an ACE inhibitor may exert additional beneficial effects.
UCP3 is an isoform of UCP1, expressed primarily in skeletal muscle. Functional properties of UCP3 are still largely unknown. Here, we report about the expression of UCP3 and of UCP1 in inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli. On solubilization and reconstitution into proteoliposomes, both UCP3 and UCP1 transport Cl- at rates equal to the reconstituted native UCP1. Cl- transport is inhibited by low concentrations of ATP, ADP, GTP and GDP. However, no H+ transport activity is found possibly due to the lack of a cofactor presents in UCP from mitochondria. The specificity of inhibition by nucleoside tri- and diphosphate is different between UCP1 and UCP3. UCP1 is more sensitive to tri- than diphosphate whereas in UCP3, the gradient is reverse. These results show a new paradigm for the regulation of thermogenesis at various tissues by the ATP/ADP ratio. In brown adipose tissue, the thermogenesis is correlated with a low ATP/ADP whereas in skeletal muscle, non-shivering thermogenesis is active at a high ATP/ADP ratio, i.e. in the resting state.
CD38 ligation on mouse B cells by CS/2, an anti-mouse CD38 mAb, induces proliferation, IL-5 receptor alpha chain expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, stimulation of splenic B cells with IL-5 together with CS/2 induces Blimp-1 expression and differentiation into Ig-producing cells. Here we examined the role of IL-5 in IgG1 and IgA production by B cells isolated from the spleen and peritoneal cavity. CD38 recognized by CS/2 was expressed in the follicular mantle B cells surrounding the germinal center, sIgD+ splenic B cells and peritoneal B cells. IL-5 induced IgG1 production in splenic sIgD+ B cells stimulated with CS/2, while it was ineffective to induce IgA production. Among the various cytokines tested, only IL-5 had a synergistic effect on IgG1 production with CS/2. IL-5 could induce the generation of S micro-Sgamma1 reciprocal recombination DNA products in CS/2-stimulated B cells. IL-4 was ineffective to induce either micro-gamma1 switch recombination or IgG1 secretion with CS/2, demonstrating that IL-5 promotes both micro-gamma1 switch recombination and IgG1 secretion in an IL-4-independent manner. The peritoneal B-2 cells exhibited both IgG1 and IgA production in response to IL-5 plus CS/2, while B-1 cells produced IgG1. These results imply that the pattern of differentiation to Ig-producing cells seen with peritoneal B cells is not identical to the pattern seen with splenic B cells and that peritoneal B-2 cells contain precursors of IgA-producing cells responding to IL-5 plus CS/2.
NSF and alpha-SNAP have been shown to be required for SNARE complex disassembly and exocytosis. However, the exact requirement for NSF and alpha-SNAP in vesicular traffic through the secretory pathway remains controversial. We performed a study on the kinetics of exocytosis from bovine chromaffin cells using high time resolution capacitance measurement and electrochemical amperometry, combined with flash photolysis of caged Ca2+ as a fast stimulus. alpha-SNAP, a C-terminal mutant of alpha-SNAP, and NEM were assayed for their effects on secretion kinetics. Two kinetically distinct components of catecholamine release can be observed upon fast step-like elevation of [Ca2+]i. One is the exocytotic burst, thought to represent the readily releasable pool of vesicles. Following the exocytotic burst, secretion proceeds slowly at maintained high [Ca2+]i, which may represent vesicle maturation/recruitment, i.e. some priming steps after docking. alpha-SNAP increased the amplitude of both the exocytotic burst and the slow component but did not change their kinetics, which we examined with millisecond time resolution. In addition, NEM only partially inhibited the slow component without altering the exocytotic burst, fusion kinetics and the rate of endocytosis. These results suggest a role for alpha-SNAP/NSF in priming granules for release at an early step, but not modifying the fusion of readily releasable granules.
CD38 is a leukocyte activation antigen and ectoenzyme [NAD(P)+ glycohydrolase; EC 3.2.2.6] involved in numerous immune functions. The human CD38 gene is complex [eight exons, >80 kilobases (kb) long] located on Chromosome 4p15, and part of the eukaryotic NAD+ glycohydrolase/ADP-ribosyl cyclase gene family. Because of the increasing relevance of the CD38 molecule in the host immune response to infectious, tumoral, and metabolic diseases, we investigated the genetic variability and linkage of the human CD38 locus. We report that (1) the restriction endonuclease Pvu II identifies a bi-allelic polymorphism here defined as formed by the alleles CD38*A (12 kb) and CD38*B (9/2.5 kb); (2) their frequency in the healthy Italian Caucasian population is 14% and 86%, respectively; (3) the polymorphic Pvu II site is located at the 5' end of the first intron of the CD38 gene; (4) in conjunction with the polymorphic site, we identified a 900 base pair CpG island associated with the CD38 gene, with two potential Sp1 binding sites; (5) the CpG island may play a role in the regulation of CD38 expression and is hypomethylated in various cell lines; (6) by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis we show that CD38 and its paralogue, the bone-marrow stromal cell antigen BST-1 (CD157), map to the same 800 kb Avi II fragment, indicating that the two human ecto-NADase genes are closely linked.
CD36 is homologous with myocardial long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) binding protein and has been suggested to relate to myocardial fatty acid metabolism. Myocardial scintigraphy with iodine-123 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R, S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) revealed an impairment in LCFA metabolism chiefly in the hypertrophic myocardium in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Recently, the incidence of CD36 deficiency has been reported to be high in HCM patients, and CD36 deficiency was proposed as an etiology of hereditary HCM. However, the pathophysiological effect of CD36 deficiency on HCM has not been fully investigated. We analysed the expression of CD36 antigens on both platelets and monocytes obtained from 82 patients with HCM using two-color flow cytometry. Among the study patients, seven patients (8.5%) demonstrated type II CD36 deficiency, whereas type I CD36 deficiency was not detected. Two of 23 patients (8.7%) with a family history of HCM and five of 59 patients (8.5%) without a family history of HCM showed type II CD36 deficiency respectively. Contrary to the previous report, three of 53 patients with asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH) (5.7%) and four of 29 patients without ASH (13.8%) showed CD36 deficiency. Moreover, clinical characteristics, scintigraphic findings, echocardiographic data, and hemodynamic findings disclosed no significant differences between the HCM patients showing normal CD36 expression and those with CD36 deficiency. The incidence of CD36 deficiency in HCM patients is not higher than in the general population. Therefore, CD36 deficiency is not a characteristic factor of HCM and has little influence on the pathyphysiology of HCM.
CD38 is expressed on a variety of hematopoietic cells and has a unique enzymatic activity that converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) into cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and then into ADPR. CD38 is expressed at increasingly higher levels on B cells at each stage of B cell differentiation, and is then down-regulated on germinal center B cells and mature plasma cells. Crosslinking of CD38 on the surface of mature, resting B cells induces B-cell proliferation, which is enhanced by co-signals such as IL-4 and LPS. CD38-induced proliferation is abrogated by Fc gammaRIIB ligation and this inhibition can be effected by the addition of anti-Fc gammaRII Ab midway through a 48 h in vitro culture indicating that it delivers a potent negative signal to CD38 activated B cells. The suppressive signal was shown to occur through the Fc gammaRIIB because CD38-induced B-cell activation was not inhibited by the ligation of Fc gammaRIIB in Fc gammaRII-deficient B cells. These results indicate that Fc gammaRIIB can act as a regulatory molecule that modulates CD38 signals in vivo.
CYP2D6 is polymorphically distributed so that in poor metabolizers enzyme activity is missing. The goal of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of codeine with and without quinidine between Caucasian and Chinese extensive metabolizers of debrisoquin. Nine Caucasians and eight Chinese subjects received in random, double blind fashion, on two occasions, codeine 120 mg. with placebo or with quinidine 100 mg. Pharmacodynamic effects were determined over 6 h. Codeine-apparent clearance and partial metabolic clearance by O-demethylation were significantly greater in the Caucasian than in the Chinese subjects (1939 +/- 175 ml/min versus 1301 +/- 193 ml/min, p <.03 and 162.7 +/- 36.6 ml/min versus 52.7 +/- 12.7 ml/min, p <.02, respectively). Codeine's respiratory effects (except on resting ventilation) were significantly greater in the Caucasian than in the Chinese subjects (p <.05), but no interethnic differences were noted in codeine's effect on the digit symbol substitution test and pupillary ratio. No morphine or morphine metabolites were detected in plasma when codeine was coadministered with quinidine. Codeine O-demethylation was significantly reduced after quinidine in both ethnic groups; however, the absolute decrease was greater in Caucasians (115.8 +/- 25.9 ml/min versus 46.8 +/- 10.6 ml/min, respectively, p <.03). The diminished production of morphine after quinidine was associated in the Caucasians, but not in the Chinese, with a marked reduction in codeine's effects (p <.01). In conclusion, Chinese produce less morphine from codeine, exhibit reduced sensitivity to that morphine, and therefore might experience reduced analgesic effect in response to codeine. In addition, quinidine induced inhibition of codeine O-demethylation is ethnically dependent with the reduction being greater in Caucasians.
CD36 is one of the major glycoproteins of platelets and known as GPIV. Besides platelets, CD36 is distributed in megakaryocytes, monocytes, capillary endothelium and mammary epithelial cells. In vitro analyses, CD36 is reported to act as receptors to a variety of ligands including collagen, thrombospondin, malaria-infected erythrocytes and oxidized LDL. However, it remains unclear to which of these functions CD36 is critical in vivo. CD36-deficient individuals can be the key to answer this question. In calcium-deficient state, CD36-deficient platelets exhibited a delay and decline of irreversible aggregation on agonist stimulation. Irreversible aggregation of platelets depends on intake of arachidonic acid once-secreted from platelets and production of its metabolite Eps/TxA2. The calcium influx in response to U46619 (TxA2 analogue) of CD36-deficient platelets was not different from normal platelets in the presence of indomethacin and ETYA. Defective aggregation of CD36-deficient platelets in calcium-deficient state seemed to be derived from defective intake of arachidonic acid. This assumption was verified by our results that inhibitory effect of arachidonic acid in aggregation depended on the presence of platelet CD36. Intake of arachidonic acid through CD36 may have an effect in low concentration state of arachidonic acid. The CD36 deficiency is present in several % in Japanese and approximately 0.3% in Caucasians and is divided in type I (deficient in platelets and monocytes) and type II (deficient only in platelets). Analyses of CD36 cDNA revealed that codon 90 (proline/serine) was critical as to the surface expression of CD36 protein. By analyses of CD36 genomic DNA, the CD36 gene could be classified; 1) serine90 type that was not translated as CD36 protein, 2) proline90 type that was not transcribed to mRNA, 3) proline90 type that was transcribed only in monocytes and not in platelets, 4) proline90 type that was transcribed in platelets but in very small amounts and 5) wild type proline 90. The results of family studies were consistent with the assumption described above.
CA1 is the major output area for the hippocampus, and current evidence shows that it is excited primarily from ipsilateral and contralateral CA3 pyramidal cells in the rat. Direct connections from the midline thalamic nuclei to the hippocampus have been described anatomically, but the physiological role of these connections has not been reported until the recent observation that these inputs may have a mild excitatory effect (subthreshold for population spikes). In this study, we report a more powerful excitatory effect of thalamic stimulation on the response of the CA1 neurons in the urethane-anesthetized rat. Electrical stimulation to the midline thalamus induced responses similar to responses from stimulation of the contralateral hippocampus (CA3), with well-developed field excitatory postsynaptic potentials and large population spikes. The latency of the CA1 response suggested that the thalamic connection was monosynaptic, and there was a laminar CA1 response profile that depended on the site of stimulation (contralateral CA3 or thalamus). In an initial examination of possible differences in the physiological effects of these two pathways on the CA1 region, we tested both sites for long-term potentiation of CA1, for the effects of repetitive stimulation on CA1 responses (e.g., possible augmenting responses) and for the effect of paired-pulse stimulation. In these three measures, there were clear and statistically significant differences between the effects of CA3 and thalamic stimulation on CA1 responses. This study demonstrates that the well-described thalamic connection to the hippocampus allows for the direct and powerful excitation of the CA1 region. This thalamohippocampal connection bypasses the trisynaptic/commissural pathway that has been thought to be the exclusive excitatory drive to CA1. In addition, preliminary data indicate that the thalamus and CA3 inputs have different physiological effects on CA1 pyramidal cells.
ACE inhibitors have been shown to potentiate the effects of exogenous bradykinin by inhibition of its breakdown. Despite this, there is little evidence that inhibition of endogenous bradykinin breakdown actually contributes to the effects of ACE inhibitors, or indeed, other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin II type I receptor (AT(1)) antagonists, and no evidence at all that it does so in patients with heart failure.
CYP2C9 is mainly responsible for the metabolic clearance of phenytoin and (S)-warfarin. We have shown previously that mutations in the CYP2C9 gene are associated with diminished metabolism of (S)-warfarin, and so we have now studied the metabolism of phenytoin to its primary inactive metabolite, (S)-pHPPH, by these mutant enzymes. Kinetic parameters were determined for (S)-pHPPH formation using recombinant CYP2C9 variants purified from insect cells. The data demonstrate that the CYP2C9*3 gene product retains only 4-6% of the metabolic efficiency of the wild-type protein, CYP2C9*1, towards phenytoin and (S)-warfarin. Consequently, we suggest that homozygous expression of CYP2C9*3 may represent a common genetic basis for (apparently) idiosyncratic toxicities that have been reported for these two low therapeutic index drugs.
LTC4S conjugates reduce glutathione to LTA4 and is positioned as the pivotal and only committed enzyme involved in the formation of cysteinyl LTs. Despite its function as an enzyme that conjugates glutathione to LTA4, it is abundantly clear that LTC4S differs from the classic glutathione S-transferase (GST) families. This distinction is based on narrow substrate specificity, inability to conjugate GSH to xenobiotics, differential susceptibility to inhibitors, lack of homology, and failure to be immunorecognized by specific microsomal GST antibodies. The presence of LTC4S protein is restricted to a limited number of hematopoietic cells to include mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes/macrophages, and platelets, with the platelet being unique in its lack of the complete biosynthetic pathway for cysteinyl LTs. The purification of the protein and the cloning of the cDNA have demonstrated that the kinetic parameters of LTC4S are similar for the isolated natural or recombinant proteins. The protein is an 18-kDa integral perinuclear membrane enzyme, which is functional as a homodimer. The cDNA encodes a 150 amino-acid polypeptide monomer with three hydrophobic domains interspersed by two hydrophilic loops. Homology and secondary structural predictions have revealed that LTC4S is a member of a novel gene family that includes FLAP, mGST II, and mGST III. Each of these molecules is an integral membrane protein with the capacity to participate in LT biosynthesis: LTC4S as the terminal and only committed enzyme in cysteinyl LT formation, FLAP as an arachidonic acid presentation protein, and mGST II and mGST III as unique dual-function enzymes with primary detoxification functions. Site directed mutagenic studies of LTC4S have revealed that two residues, R51 and Y93, are involved in the acid and base catalysis, respectively, of LTA4 and GSH. Alignment of molecules with LTA4 conjugating ability demonstrates conservation of amino acid residues R51 and Y93, which appear necessary for this specific enzymatic function. The 2.5-Kb gene for human LTC4S contains five small exons and four introns, and the 5' UTR contains consensus sequences for AP-1 and AP-2 sites as well as an SP-1 site. The chromosomal localization of this gene is 5q35, distal to that of cytokine, growth factor, and receptor genes that have relevance to the development of allergic inflammation. Furthermore, there is genetic linkage of this region of human chromosome 5 to atopy and asthma, whereas no linkage exists for the chromosomal localization of the other family members, FLAP and mGST II, distinguishing LTC4S as a unique member of the novel gene family. LTC4S is profoundly overexpressed in the aspirin-induced asthmatic phenotype and correlates with overproduction of cysteinyl LTs and bronchial hyperreactivity to lysine aspirin. Ongoing studies are directed to the genomic regulation and additional polymorphisms within the gene of this pivotal enzyme, as well as to further identification of the amino acid residues central to its catalytic function.
CD38 is a multifunctional cell surface ectoenzyme that catalyzes both the synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose from NAD+ and its hydrolysis to ADP-ribose. In this work, we investigated the metabolism of NADP+ by CD38 expressed on human platelets. Incubation of either platelet membranes or intact cells with NADP+ resulted in the rapid and time-dependent accumulation of ADP-ribose 2'-phosphate that paralleled the consumption of the substrate. However, under the same conditions, synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose 2'-phosphate was not observed. By immunoprecipitation experiments, we identified CD38 as the enzyme responsible for the observed NADP+ glycohydrolase activity. The lack of detection of cyclic ADP-ribose 2'-phosphate was not due to its rapid hydrolysis, since direct incubation of platelet membranes with cyclic ADP-ribose 2'-phosphate did not result in the formation of ADP-ribose 2'-phosphate. By contrast, the same membrane samples expressed a significant ability to hydrolyze cyclic ADP-ribose to ADP-ribose. The absence of cyclic ADP-ribose 2'-phosphate hydrolase activity was also confirmed using high concentrations of substrate and by analysing both intact Jurkat T-lymphocytes and immunoprecipitated CD38. These results indicate that CD38, which is a multifunctional enzyme towards NAD+, displays exclusively a NADP+ glycohydrolase activity and is unable to catalyze both the synthesis and the hydrolysis of cyclic ADP-ribose 2'-phosphate.
CYP2A6 is an enzyme with a high ability to activate a nitrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), to its potent and ultimate carcinogen. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between genetic polymorphism of CYP2A6 and lung cancer risk in a case-control study of Japanese subjects. Genotyping of the CYP2A6 gene in both healthy volunteers and lung cancer patients was conducted. The frequency with which the subjects carried homozygotes of the CYP2A6 gene deletion-type mutation (deletion), which causes lack of the enzyme activity, was lower in the lung cancer patients than in the healthy control subjects. The odds ratio (OR) of the group homozygous for the deletion was significantly lower and calculated to be 0.25 (95% CI; 0.08-0.83) when the OR for the population with homozygotes of the CYP2A6 wild-type gene was defined as 1.00. In the allelic-base analysis, there was also a significant decrease in the OR for the deletion allele. These data suggest that deficient CYP2A6 activity due to genetic polymorphism reduces lung cancer risk.
MIP has been hypothesized to be a gap junction protein, a membrane ion channel, a membrane water channel and a facilitator of glycerol transport and metabolism. These possible roles have been indirectly suggested by the localization of MIP in lens gap junctional plaques and the properties of MIP when reconstituted into artificial membranes or exogenously expressed in oocytes. We have examined lens fiber cells to see if these functions are present and whether they are affected by a mutation of MIP found in CatFr mouse lens. Of these five hypothesized functions, only one, the role of water channel, appears to be true of fiber cells in situ. Based on the rate of volume change of vesicles placed in a hypertonic solution, fiber cell membrane lipids have a low water permeability (pH2O) on the order of 1 micron/sec whereas normal fiber cell membrane pH2O was 17 micron/sec frog, 32 micron/sec rabbit and 43 micron/sec mouse. CatFr mouse lens fiber cell pH2O was reduced by 13 micron/sec for heterozygous and 30 micron/sec for homozygous mutants when compared to wild type. Lastly, when expressed in oocytes, the pH2O conferred by MIP is not sensitive to Hg2+ whereas that of CHIP28 (AQP1) is blocked by Hg2+. The fiber cell membrane pH2O was also not sensitive to Hg2+ whereas lens epithelial cell pH2O (136 micron/sec in rabbit) was blocked by Hg2+. With regard to the other hypothesized roles, fiber cell membrane or lipid vesicles had a glycerol permeability on the order of 1 nm/sec, an order of magnitude less than that conferred by MIP when expressed in oocytes. Impedance studies were employed to determine gap junctional coupling and fiber cell membrane conductance in wild-type and heterozygous CatFr mouse lenses. There was no detectable difference in either coupling or conductance between the wild-type and the mutant lenses.
ADA supports achievement of comprehensive nutrition standards in child-care programs. The standards presented in this position paper focus on meeting the child's nutrition needs and providing a safe and pleasant environment that promotes acquisition of eating habits that prevent disease and enable healthy growth and development. Dietetics professionals can play a powerful role in advocating and assisting the acceptance of child-care nutrition standards by parents, caregivers, foodservice personnel, and directors and policy makers for child-care programs.
UCP3 is a mitochondrial protein with high homology to the established uncoupling protein, UCP1. Its high degree of homology to UCP1 suggests that UCP3 may be a true uncoupling protein. Preliminary biochemical studies are consistent with UCP3 having uncoupling activity. However, detailed functional studies are required to understand the true biochemical and physiological purpose of UCP3. These efforts should be aided by identification of humans with inactivating mutations and/or the generation of gene knockout mice lacking UCP3.
SCD continues to be an important cause of death and morbidity. Despite expanding insight into the mechanisms causing SCD, the population at high risk is not being effectively identified. Although there is still much to do in the management phase of SCD (predicting the efficacy of various therapies), recent clinical trials have helped define the relative risks and benefits of therapies in preventing SCD. Trials are underway to determine whether treating other patient populations, including asymptomatic patients after MI, will improve survival rate. The approach to reducing mortality rate will always be multifaceted; primary prevention of coronary artery disease and prompt salvage of jeopardized myocardium are 2 important aspects of this approach. In addition to interventions for MI, such as myocardial revascularization when indicated, simple and easily administered therapies that are likely to remain the most effective prophylactic interventions are aspirin, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and cholesterol-lowering agents. However, the MADIT and AVID data clearly demonstrate a role for ICD therapy in a subgroup of patients who have VT/VF and are at risk of cardiac arrest. Even though the absolute magnitude of benefit associated with ICDs is still to be determined, the AVID study and other recent reports provide convincing evidence that patients who have VT/VF fare better with ICDs than with antiarrhythmic drug therapy. For the high-risk population described in this article, in addition to aggressive anti-ischemic and heart failure therapy, ICDs are now a mainstay of life-saving treatment. Still to be surmounted is the challenge of identifying patients who have nonischemic substrates and of providing them with the appropriate therapy. Guided by genetic studies and new insight into the mechanisms of such problems as congenital long QT syndrome, life-saving and life-enhancing therapies may soon be available for the management of SCD.
ACE inhibitors are well established in the treatment of arterial hypertension, heart failure and diabetic and/or hypertensive nephropathy with albuminuria. The important trials for the various indications are briefly discussed. In Switzerland 11 ACE inhibitors are available for clinical use, differing mainly in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The characteristics of practical relevance regarding oral bioavailability, elimination mechanisms and half-life, as well as the necessary dosage modifications in patients with renal, hepatic and cardiac failure, are presented. All ACE inhibitors except captopril and lisinopril are administered as prodrugs. The bioavailability among ACE inhibitors varies widely with a range from 11% (trandolapril) to more than 60% (captopril). The great majority of ACE inhibitors are eliminated predominantly through the kidneys. However, benazepril, fosinopril, ramipril, spirapril and trandolapril also have a hepatic (metabolic) route of elimination. Since half-life varies from 1 h (captopril) to 30 h (spirapril) we drew up, for simplicity, a table of 3 groups with short, medium and long t1/2. In renal insufficiency dose adjustment is required only below a creatinine-clearance level of 30 ml/min. These dosage reductions are not required in liver diseases, but renally excreted drugs such as lisinopril should be preferred. Treatment with ACE inhibitors in severe heart failure should be initiated carefully, with low doses and concomitant diuretic treatment added or maintained. Most common adverse effects of ACE inhibitors are hypotension, cough, hyperkalaemia and renal failure. Less frequent adverse effects are angioedema, bone marrow suppression and also foetal damage. Thus, ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy.
PTEN is a recently identified tumor suppressor inactivated in a variety of cancers such as glioblastoma and endometrial and prostate carcinoma. It contains an amino-terminal phosphatase domain and acts as a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatase antagonizing the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase. PTEN also contains a carboxyl-terminal domain, and we addressed the role of this region that, analogous to the amino-terminal phosphatase domain, is the target of many mutations identified in tumors. Expression of carboxyl-terminal mutants in PTEN-deficient glioblastoma cells permitted the anchorage-independent growth of the cells that otherwise was suppressed by wild-type PTEN. The stability of these mutants in cells was reduced because of rapid degradation. Although the carboxyl-terminal region contains regulatory PEST sequences and a PDZ-binding motif, these specific elements were dispensable for the tumor-suppressor function. The study of carboxyl-terminal point mutations affecting the stability of PTEN revealed that these were located in strongly predicted beta-strands. Surprisingly, the phosphatase activity of these mutants was affected in correlation with the degree of disruption of these structural elements. We conclude that the carboxyl-terminal region is essential for regulating PTEN stability and enzymatic activity and that mutations in this region are responsible for the reversion of the tumor-suppressor phenotype. We also propose that the molecular conformational changes induced by these mutations constitute the mechanism for PTEN inactivation.
CYP1A1 plays an important role in the metabolism of polycyclic hydrocarbons that occur in the environment and several studies suggest that the genetic polymorphism of the gene may play a role in the predisposition to cancer. In order to evaluate the function of CYP1A1 in vivo as a host factor determinant of environmentally-caused cancers in humans, additional investigations are needed involving not only molecular epidemiological approaches in different ethnic populations but also more direct approaches such as the use of gene-targeted mice as a model system.
LPO products were measured in plasma and biogenic amines (serotonin, adrenalin, noradrenalin) in tissues of rats in different periods after hemorrhagic shock provoked by taking blood and maintenance of arterial pressure at the level of 40 mm Hg for 1 hour. Resuscitation was conducted by administration of autoblood. It was found that splenic serotonin levels decreased on experiment day 7 and went up on day 28. On late experiment stages noradrenalin levels in the adrenals were high. Early after resuscitation the trend was noted to higher LPO products concentration in plasma and serotonin in the brain stem. Intravenous injection of semax prevented serotonin fall in the spleen on experiment day 7. It is suggested that biogenic amines, especially serotonin system, are involved in mechanisms of postresuscitation disorders, in cerebral defects in particular, through prolongation of secondary hypoxia early after hemorrhagic shock and activation of hypothalamo-hypophyso-adrenal system late after the shock.
CAD is the most common cause of death in older men and was present in 44% of 664 men, mean age 80 years. Independent risk factors for new coronary events in older men include increasing age, prior CAD, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high serum total cholesterol, and low serum HDL cholesterol. In older men with hypertension, echocardiographic LVH is a powerful independent predictor of new coronary events, atherothrombotic brain infarction, and CHF. In 554 older men with a mean age of 80 years, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography demonstrated that the prevalence of aortic stenosis was 14%, 1 + aortic regurgitation or greater was 31%, rheumatic mitral stenosis was 0.4, 1 mitral regurgitation or greater was 32%, mitral annular calcium was 35%, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was 3%, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy was 1%, left atrial enlargement was 29%, LVH was 41%, and abnormal LVEF was 29%. The prevalence and incidence of CHF increase with age in older persons. The prevalence of a normal LVEF associated with CHF as a result of prior myocardial infarction or hypertension was 22% in men aged 60 to 69 years, 33% in men aged 70 to 79 years, 41% in men aged 80 to 89 years, and 47% in men aged 90 years or older.
CD36 is expressed on several cell lineages. About 5 to 10 percent of Asians lack platelet membrane CD36 (pCD36), but the frequency of pCD36 deficiency in other ethnic groups is not known. Persons who are pCD36-negative are apparently healthy but can develop CD36 isoimmunization.
CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 are polymorphically expressed enzymes that show marked interindividual and interethnic variation. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of the defective alleles in CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 in Africans and to test whether the genotype for CYP2C19 is better correlated with the proguanil/cylcoguanil ratio than the mephenytoin S/R ratio.
ACE takes part in the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kininogen systems by creating angiotensin-II and inactivating bradykinin. ACE gene insertion/deletion polymorphism is associated with the level of circulating enzymes--subjects with the DD genotype have higher levels of circulating ACE than subjects with the II genotype and show an increased tendency towards impaired vascular function and structure. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) suffer from differentially expressed vascular pathology. We attempted to determine whether the type of ACE polymorphism could contribute to this pathology.
CYP2C9 catalyzes the metabolism of important drugs such as phenytoin, S-warfarin, tolbutamide, losartan, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A functional polymorphism of the CYP2C9 gene has been described. The single-base mutation of A1061C (Ile359Leu) in the CYP2C9 gene termed CYP2C9*3 was found at a frequency of about 2.1% in Japanese. We developed a rapid mutation analysis method for detecting the CYP2C9*1 genotype. This method is a marriage of two emerging technologies: allele-specific amplification primers for target DNA and a new double-stranded DNA-selective fluorescent dye, SYBR Green. Genotypes are separated according to the different threshold cycles of the wild-type and mutant primers. We applied this procedure to DNA extracted from the blood of healthy Japanese volunteers. The CYP2C9 wild-type CYP2C9*1/CYP2C9*1 and heterozygous CYP2C9*1/CYP2C9*3 genotypes of the CYP2C9 alleles detected by the assay were consistent with the results obtained from restriction enzyme cleavage. No genotype of CYP2C9*3/CYP2C9*3 was found in these samples. Using plasmid DNA containing a point mutation of CYP2C9*3 as template, the assay separated the three genotypes. We conclude that this simple, rapid, and inexpensive procedure is applicable to routine high-throughput assays.
ACE inhibitors are important therapeutic agents in controlling hypertension, correcting some of its pathophysiological derangement and improving its prognosis. While there are many such agents, there may be some important differences between them. This placebo run-in, double blind, crossover study, using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, compares the efficacy of perindopril 4-8 mg and enalapril 10-20 mg as once daily antihypertensive agents on 32 patients. For diastolic blood pressure (DBP), perindopril had a placebo-corrected peak (P) reduction of blood pressure (BP) of -6.4 +/- 1.3 mmHg vs its placebo-corrected trough (T) of -5.2 +/- 1.7 mmHg. Enalapril had a reduction in DBP of -8.5 +/- 1.3 mmHg (P) and -5.7 +/- 1.7 mmHg (T). For systolic blood pressure (SBP), perindopril had a reduction of -7.5 +/- 1.6 mmHg (P) vs -7.3 +/- 2.2 mmHg (T) compared to enalapril with -10.8 +/- 1.6 mmHg (P) vs -8.3 +/- 2.3 mmHg (T). Placebo-corrected trough-to-peak ratio (SBP/DBP) for perindopril was 0.97/0.81 vs 0.77/0.67 for enalapril. There was no difference noted in 24-hour mean BP, area under the curve or post-dose casual BP measurements. Both perindopril and enalapril were well tolerated and the two treatment groups had similar safety profiles. Perindopril thus had a predictable and sustained blood pressure effect giving a 24-hour cover for the patient without excessive peak effect or poor trough effect.
CA3 pyramidal neurons in the rat hippocampus show selective vulnerability to the intracerebroventricular injection of kainic acid (KA). However, the mechanism of this selective neuronal vulnerability remains unclear. In this study, we examined the contribution of endogenous adenosine, a potent inhibitory neuromodulator, to the differences in the neuronal vulnerability of the hippocampus, using microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-2, phosphorylated c-Jun, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II immunoreactivities as markers for neuronal cell loss, neuronal apoptosis and glial activation, respectively. Pretreatment with 8-cyclopenthyltheophylline (CPT), an A1 adenosine receptor antagonist, significantly exacerbated KA-induced neuronal cell loss in both the CA1 and CA3. Although c-Jun phosphorylation, a critical step in neuronal apoptosis, was not detected in the vehicle-injected rat hippocampus, c-Jun phosphorylation was induced in the CA3 by the injection of KA alone. Pretreatment with CPT induced c-Jun phosphorylation in both the CA1 and CA3. MHC class II antigen was also detected in the regions of c-Jun phosphorylation. Coadministration of N6-cyclopenthyladenosine (CHA), an A1 adenosine receptor agonist, attenuated the neuronal cell loss in the CA1 and CA3 with or without pretreatment with CPT. These results strongly suggest that endogenous adenosine has neuroprotective effects against excitotoxin-induced neurodegeneration in the CA1 through its A1 receptors.
GPI anchors are widely represented among organisms and have several cellular functions. It has been proposed that in yeast there are two groups of GPI proteins: plasma membrane-resident proteins, such as Gas1p or Yap3p, and cell wall-targeted proteins, such as Tir1p or alpha-agglutinin. A model has been proposed for the plasma membrane retention of proteins from the first group because of a dibasic motif located just upstream of the GPI-anchoring signal. The results we report here are not in agreement with such a model as we show that constructs containing the C-terminal parts of Gas1p and Yap3p are also targeted to the cell wall. We also detect the genuine Gas1p after cell wall treatment with Quantazyme or Glucanex glycanases. In addition, we show that the GPI-anchoring signal from the human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) is not compatible with the yeast machinery unless the human transamidase hGpi8p is co-expressed. In this condition, this human signal is able to target a protein to the cell wall. Moreover, TIR1 proved to be a multicopy suppressor of Deltagas1 mutation. The present findings suggest a constitutive role for GPI anchors in yeast: the cell wall targeting of proteins.
PDE4C is one of four mammalian genes that encode multiple PDE4 cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoforms that are inhibited by rolipram. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation localised PDE4C to the p13.1 region of human chromosome 19. Overlapping cosmid clones spanning the human PDE4C gene were identified and characterised. Analysis of this locus indicated that the PDE4C gene spans at least 38 kb, consists of at least 18 exons, and contains the marker D19S212 within an intron. Comparison of published human PDE4C cDNA sequences with those of the genomic DNA identified four alternatively spliced exons and the possibility that the PDE4C locus contains at least three alternative promoters. PDE4C-containing cosmids also contained the genes for the growth regulatory transcription factor, JUND, and the mini guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, RAB3A. The RAB3A gene was shown to consist of 5 exons spanning 7.9 kb, while the JUND gene was found to contain no introns. Analysis of cosmids containing PDE4C, JUND, and RAB3A showed that 27 kb separate JUND and PDE4C, while only 3.7 kb separate PDE4C and RAB3A. The three genes share the same orientation of transcription and are arranged in the order cen- 5'- JUND-PDE4C-RAB3A-3'-tel.
RPE cells irradiated by near-ultraviolet (NUV) were characterized at cellular, biochemical and molecular levels in order to determine whether light-induced RPE changes contribute to the senescence of RPE cells in vitro. Biochemical and molecular parameters of cellular senescence were studied by using both bovine RPE cells at confluence repeatedly irradiated by NUV (peaking at 365 nm) and RPE cells at different levels of population doubling (PDL). After repeated NUV irradiation, RPE proliferation was markedly suppressed. In parallel, the BrdU index significantly reduced to a minimum level, similar to RPE cells undergoing multiple population doublings. NUV irradiation resulted in a decrease in cellular alkali-soluble melanin and an increase in lipofuscin-like fluorophores. The lipofuscin-like fluorophores, isolated from RPE cells exposing repeated NUV irradiation, represented a gradual hyperchromic change and red-shift, reaching the wavelength maxima (560-572 nm), at excitation wavelength of 365 nm, a typical range of 'age pigment'. These phenomena were substantially eliminated in oxygen-free conditions. Both the NUV-irradiated RPE cells and RPE cells at 20 Pd expressed 4 to 8-fold and 2 to 4-fold less PEDF and TIMP-3 genes, respectively. As result of experiments using chronic photochemical treatment, RPE cells represented several characteristics of cellular senescence. In addition to alterations of the melanin/lipofuscin system, DNA synthesis was greatly suppressed in NUV-irradiated RPE cells, indicating replicative senescence. The phenomena of downregulation of the possible senescence markers imply that photochemical reactions of RPE cells accelerate the process of RPE senescence.
CFTR possesses a large cluster of strict dibasic consensus sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) in the R-domain and an obligatory dependence on phosphorylation is a hallmark of CFTR Cl(-) channel function. Removal of as many as 11 of these sites reduces the conformational change in the R-domain and the degree of channel activation in response to PKA. However, until recently a completely PKA-unresponsive CFTR variant has not been reported, leaving open the possibility that the residual response may be mediated by associating ancillary phosphoproteins. We traced the residual PKA-catalyzed (32)P-labelling of the variant with 11 sites mutagenized (11SA) to distinct CNBr phosphopeptides within the R-domain. Mutagenesis of 4 additional monobasic sites in these segments produced a 15SA variant in which Cl(-) channel response to PKA was abolished. Therefore, it can be concluded that ancillary phosphoproteins do not contribute to CFTR activation by PKA. Notably, however, the 15SA protein did exhibit a low level of constitutive channel activity not dependent on PKA, which might have reflected a down-regulating effect of phosphorylation of one or two of the 15 sites as suggested by others. However, this did not prove to be the case.Since immature CFTR has been claimed to be active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we also examined whether it can be phosphorylated in cells and what influence if any this might have on its susceptibility to degradation. Teleologically, activation by phosphorylation of CFTR Cl(-) channels in the ER might be undesirable to the cell. Using various phosphorylation site mutants and kinase and phosphatase inhibitors in pulse-chase experiments, we have found that although nascent CFTR can be phosphorylated at the ER, this is without effect on its ability to mature and avoid proteolysis. Furthermore, we found that microsomes from cells expressing CFTR processing mutants such as DeltaF508 do not generate Cl(-) active channels when fused with planar bilayers unless maturation is promoted, e.g. by growth of cells at reduced temperature or other means. We conclude that the ER-retained mutant nascent chains which are incapable of maturation may be phosphorylated but do not form active channels. Stimulation by PKA of the insertion of CFTR containing vesicles into the plasma membrane as part of the mechanism of stimulation of chloride secretion has been reported, as has an influence of CFTR on the balance between endocytosis and exocytosis but these findings have not been universally confirmed.
PTEN phosphatase is a tumor suppressor gene that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol phosphates. PTEN restrains the function of a major antiapoptotic and survival pathway involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Akt kinase. Our purpose was to find out whether apoptotic inducers affect the expression of PTEN in cerebellar granule neurons and neuroblastoma 2a cells (Neuro-2a). PTEN mRNA expression showed a major 5.5-kb and a lower abundance 2.5-kb transcripts. In Neuro-2a cells, serum withdrawal induced a prominent, continuous decrease both in 5.5- and 2.5-kb transcripts of PTEN mRNA. Simultaneously, the expression level of 56-kDa PTEN protein decreased in Neuro-2a cells. The decrease in PTEN expression precedes apoptotic changes observed after serum withdrawal. On the contrary, okadaic acid and etoposide only slightly affected the expression of PTEN although they induce a prominent apoptosis in Neuro-2a cells. In cerebellar granule neurons, okadaic acid treatment induced a prominent increase in PTEN mRNA expression after 6-h treatment, both at the 5.5- and 2.5-kb transcripts. The early response in PTEN mRNA expression disappeared in 5.5-kb transcripts already at 12 h and in the case of 2.5-kb transcripts it lasted up to 24 h. Potassium deprivation, known to induce apoptosis in cerebellar granule cells, did not affect PTEN mRNA expression but together with serum deprivation induced a clear decrease in the 5. 5-kb PTEN transcripts. It seems that the changes in PTEN expression level and neuronal apoptosis are not related to each other in general but the expression of PTEN phosphatase seems to regulate certain apoptotic signals affecting phosphoinositide 3-kinase function.
CD38 displays lateral association with the HIV-1 receptor CD4. This association is potentiated by the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. The aim of this work was to evaluate the CD38 role in T cell susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Using laboratory X4 HIV-1 strains and X4 and X4/R5 primary isolates, we found that CD38 expression was negatively correlated to cell susceptibility to infection, evaluated as percentage of infected cells, release of HIV p24 in the supernatants, and cytopathogenicity. This correlation was at first suggested by results obtained in a panel of human CD4(+) T cell lines expressing different CD38 levels (MT-4, MT-2, C8166, CEMx174, Supt-1, and H9) and then demonstrated using CD38 transfectants of MT-4 cells (the line with the lowest CD38 expression). To address whether CD38 affected viral binding, we used mouse T cells that are non-permissive for productive infection. Gene transfection in mouse SR.D10.CD4(-).F1 T cells produced four lines expressing human CD4 and/or CD38. Ability of CD4(+)CD38(+)cells to bind HIV-1 or purified recombinant gp120 was significantly lower than that of CD4(+)CD38(-) cells. These data suggest that CD38 expression inhibits lymphocyte susceptibility to HIV infection, probably by inhibiting gp120/CD4-dependent viral binding to target cells.-Savarino, A., Bottarel, F., Calosso, L., Feito, M. J., Bensi, T., Bragardo, M., Rojo, J. M., Pugliese, A., Abbate, I., Capobianchi, M. R., Dianzani, F., Malavasi, F., and Dianzani, U. Effects of the human CD38 glycoprotein on the early stages of theHIV-1 replication cycle.
CA1 pyramidal cells are the primary output neurons of the hippocampus, carrying information about the result of hippocampal network processing to the subiculum and entorhinal cortex (EC) and thence out to the rest of the brain. The primary excitatory drive to the CA1 pyramidal cells comes via the Schaffer collateral (SC) projection from area CA3. There is also a direct projection from EC to stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) of CA1, an input well positioned to modulate information flow through the hippocampus. High-frequency stimulation in SLM evokes an inhibition sufficiently strong to prevent CA1 pyramidal cells from spiking in response to SC input, a phenomenon we refer to as spike-blocking. We characterized the spike-blocking efficacy of burst stimulation (10 stimuli at 100 Hz) in SLM and found that it is greatest at approximately 300-600 ms after the burst, consistent with the time course of the slow GABA(B) signaling pathway. Spike-blocking efficacy increases in potency with the number of SLM stimuli in a burst, but also decreases with repeated presentations of SLM bursts. Spike-blocking was eliminated in the presence of GABA(B) antagonists. We have identified a candidate population of interneurons in SLM and distal stratum radiatum (SR) that may mediate this spike-blocking effect. We conclude that the output of CA1 pyramidal cells, and hence the hippocampus, is modulated in an input pattern-dependent manner by activation of the direct pathway from EC.
CYP3A4 is generally believed to be the major CYP enzyme involved in the biotransformation of lidocaine in man; however, recent in vivo studies suggest that this may not be the case. We have examined the effects of the CYP3A4 inhibitors erythromycin and ketoconazole and the CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine on the N-deethylation, i.e. formation of monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX), and 3-hydroxylation of lidocaine by human liver microsomes. The experiments were carried out at lidocaine concentrations of 5 microM (clinically relevant concentration) and 800 microM. The formation of both MEGX and 3-hydroxylidocaine was best described by a two-enzyme model. At 5 microM of lidocaine, fluvoxamine was a potent inhibitor of the formation of MEGX (IC50 1.2 microM). Ketoconazole and erythromycin also showed an inhibitory effect on MEGX formation, but ketoconazole (IC50 8.5 microM) was a much more potent inhibitor than erythromycin (IC50 200 microM). At 800 microM of lidocaine, fluvoxamine (IC50 20.7 microM) and ketoconazole (IC50 20.4 microM) displayed a modest inhibitory effect on MEGX formation, whereas erythromycin was a weak inhibitor (IC50 >250 microM). The 3-hydroxylation of lidocaine was potently inhibited by fluvoxamine at both lidocaine concentrations (IC50 0.16 microM at 5 microM and 1.8 microM at 800 microM). Erythromycin and ketoconazole showed a clear inhibitory effect on the 3-hydroxylation of lidocaine at 5 microM of lidocaine (IC50 9.9 microM and 13.9 microM, respectively), but did not show a consistent effect at 800 microM of lidocaine (IC50 >250 microM and 75.0 microM, respectively). Although further studies are needed to elucidate the role of distinct CYP enzymes in the biotransformation of lidocaine in humans, the findings of this study suggest that while both CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are involved in the metabolism of lidocaine by human liver microsomes, CYP1A2 is the more important isoform at clinically relevant lidocaine concentrations.
HAS1 was expressed as a FLAG-tagged HAS1 fusion protein in COS-1 cells. This recombinant protein was extracted with CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid) from the membrane fraction and purified by anti-FLAG affinity chromatography and subsequent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A protein solubilized from the one single band on the gel was able to synthesize hyaluronan when incubated with UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcA as donor substrates without any further additions. The detergent-solubilized and purified HAS1 protein, however, exhibited quite different kinetic properties from the membrane-bound protein. When assayed under the reconstitutive conditions where the reaction mixture was layered onto the buffer containing high concentration of CHAPS, the activity was enhanced and the kinetic properties became similar to those of the membrane-bound protein. In addition, a HAS1 gene product by an in vitro transcription/translation system also showed HAS1 activity under the reconstitutive conditions. To our surprise, when incubated with UDP-GlcNAc alone, the protein was found to synthesize chito-oligosaccharide. Taking advantage of these enzyme reaction properties, active sites on the protein involved in for hyaluronan and chito-oligosaccharide synthesis were characterized. Site-directed mutagenesis induced in the cytoplasmic central loop domain of the protein revealed that several amino acid residues conserved among those domains of various proteins of a HAS family were essential for both hyaluronan and chito-oligosaccharide syntheses but one of them was not for chito-oligosaccharide synthesis. The substitutions that caused partial or severe loss of the activity gave no significant changes of the K(m) values of the mutated proteins, suggesting that no conformational or other indirect changes were involved in the effect. Taken together, the results suggest that the HAS1 protein alone is able to synthesize hyaluronan and different amino acid residues on the cytoplasmic central loop domain are involved in transferring GlcNAc and GlcA residues, respectively.
PHEX gene and hypophosphatemia. X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) and tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) are diseases that have in common abnormal proximal renal tubular function resulting in increased renal clearance of inorganic phosphorus and hypophosphatemia. The recent discovery of the PHEX gene has provided new insights to these disorders. In this regard, identification of the PHEX gene product as a membrane-bound endopeptidase suggests that the pathophysiologic cascade underlying XLH likely involves inactivation mutations of the gene causing a failure to clear an active hormone, phosphatonin, from the circulation. The presence of this hormone through unknown mechanisms decreases the sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter in the kidney, resulting in impaired phosphate transport. In contrast, TIO likely evolves secondary to tumor overproduction of the putative phosphatonin, which exerts physiologic function despite efforts to counteract the resultant hypophosphatemia with overproduction of PHEX transcripts that are insufficient to accommodate the enhanced substrate load. These potential pathophysiologic mechanisms for XLH and TIO provide valuable inroads to understanding phosphate homeostasis, as well as vitamin D metabolism, bone mineralization, and calcium metabolism.
ACE genotype and ACE induced renoprotection in chronic proteinuric nephropathies.
CD38 is a 42- to 45-kDa type II transmembrane glycoprotein with the ability to synthesize cADPR, a metabolite with potent calcium mobilizing properties independent of IP(3). We report here the primary characterization and localization of CD38 in the plasma membrane fraction of rat hepatocyte. Western blot analysis of a partially purified plasma membrane fraction with a panel of polyclonal antibodies against CD38 detected a 42- to 45-kDa protein band which is characteristic of CD38. ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity was found to be present in the plasma membrane fraction, indicating the presence of functionally active CD38. Subfractionation of the plasma membrane to the sinusoidal and bile canalicular membrane fractions showed the presence of ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity in both fractions with the sinusoidal membrane fraction having a 10-fold higher specific activity than the bile canalicular membrane fraction. Immunohistochemical staining with the same panel of polyclonal antibodies showed exclusive differential spatial localization to both the nuclei and sinusoidal domain of the plasma membrane. It is possible that the different spatial distribution of CD38 in the rat hepatocyte might be responsible for its myriad of previously known functional roles.
ACE inhibitors are a widely prescribed class of drug for the management of hypertension. Their therapeutic role in the treatment of heart failure, diabetic nephropathy and post myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction is steadily increasing. Although ACE inhibitors have a similar mechanism of action--namely, inhibition of circulatory ACE, thereby decreasing the formation of angiotensin II--individual members differ in their physicochemical properties, enzyme-binding kinetics, pharmacokinetic profile, organ-specific affinity and selectivity, as well as in their bradykinin potentiating effect. These factors play an important part in influencing the pharmacological profile of an agent and its clinical efficacy, especially in the treatment of hypertension. It is therefore prudent to take into account the existing pharmacological and clinically relevant differences between the individual members of this drug class before making the decision to select a particular ACE inhibitor for the long-term management of arterial hypertension.
CD38 is a transmembrane molecule whose expression varies during hematopoietic cell differentiation. We used stroma-supported cultures of human myeloid cells to assess the effects of CD38 ligation on myeloid differentiation. In 8 experiments with CD34(+ )cells purified from normal bone marrow or cord blood, flow cytometry used with antibodies to CD34 and myeloperoxidase (MPO) identified 4 cell populations after 7 days of culture. Addition of anti-CD38 (T16) to the cultures induced a profound reduction of the most mature (CD34(-)MPO(++)) cell population, which includes promyelocytes, myelocytes and metamyelocytes; mean (+/- SD) cell recovery was 12.8% +/- 9.8% of that in parallel cultures with an isotype-matched control antibody. The suppressive effect of CD38 ligation on phenotypically more immature normal cells was inconsistent but generally less pronounced. Recovery of CD34(++)MPO(-) cells was 63.3% +/- 24.4%, recovery of CD34([+/-] )MPO(- )cells was 95.3% +/- 35.1%, and recovery of CD34(-)MPO(+) cells was 42.0% +/- 18.7% of that in control cultures. However, anti-CD38 suppressed recovery of cells obtained from 6 patients with CD38(+) acute myeloid leukemia; after 7-day cultures, cell recovery was 25.2% +/- 21.7% of that in control cultures. Cell recovery was also reduced by F(ab')(2) or Fab fragments of anti-CD38. CD38 ligation dramatically suppressed recovery of murine 32D myeloid cells transfected with human CD38 and cocultured with stroma (3.8% +/- 7.3%; n = 7). CD38 ligation of CD38( + )32D cells also induced cell aggregation, tyrosine kinase activity, and Ca(++) influx. We conclude that CD38 mediates signals that culminate in suppression of myeloid cell growth and survival. (Blood. 2000;95:535-542)
CYP1A1 is implicated in the bioactivation of procarcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. To date, no physiological compounds have been described as inducers of this gene. In this study, we have examined the role of serum in the regulation of CYP1A1 gene expression. After treatment of CaCo-2 cells with fetal bovine serum, CYP1A1 mRNA level increased to the same extent as that observed after 3-methylcholanthrene induction. The same effect was obtained after treatment with adult bovine or human serum. Evaluation of hnRNA level performed on CaCo-2 cells indicates that CYP1A1 induction by serum acts at least in part through transcriptional activation. Promoter region containing the XRE (1.56 kb) was tested in the CAT assay. No stimulation of this reporter gene was detected after serum treatment. These results demonstrate for the first time that physiological compound(s) contained in serum induces CYP1A1 gene expression by transcriptional activation independent of the AhR pathway.
CD38 ligation has been shown to induce activation of intracellular signaling cascade in T lymphocytes through a Lck-dependent pathway. However, it is not clear how Lck initiates the CD38-mediated signaling process. In the present study, we showed that CD38 and Lck were physically associated through the cytoplasmic tail and the Src homology 2 domain, respectively. This was evidenced by coimmunoprecipitation of Lck with CD38 and Lck with isolated CD38 cytoplasmic domain from T cell lysate, cell lysate of COS-7 cells cotransfected with cDNAs of Lck and CD38, or a mixture of in vitro translated CD38 and Lck. Because the CD38 cytoplasmic domain does not contain any tyrosine residue, the interaction should be independent of phosphotyrosine. The interaction was further confirmed by in vitro interaction between a purified Lck Src homology 2 domain and a nonphosphosynthetic peptide corresponding to the membrane proximal region of the CD38 cytoplasmic domain. In addition, CD38 ligation resulted in an elevated tyrosine kinase activity of the CD38-associated Lck and ultimate activation of interleukin-2 gene transcription. Furthermore, expression of a kinase-deficient Lck mutant suppressed interleukin-2 gene activation in a dose-dependent manner. These results strongly suggested that CD38 ligation indeed tranduced signals for T cell activation using its associated Lck.
MIP channels occur in all classes of organism ranging from bacteria to man. There are two major categories of MIP channels, aquaporins and glycerol facilitators, which facilitate the diffusion across biological membranes of water or glycerol and other uncharged compounds, respectively. As a result of their involvement in osmoregulation and metabolism, MIP channels are believed to affect a wide range of biological processes.
CYP2C9 is involved in the metabolism of the oral anticoagulants warfarin, phenprocoumon, and acenocoumarol. It is also responsible for the 5'-hydroxylation of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug lornoxicam. Therefore, lornoxicam and the oral anticoagulants are potential inhibitors of their metabolism. Their inhibitory potency was investigated in microsomes from six human livers. An approach to predict pharmacokinetic interactions of lornoxicam from in vitro inhibition data was developed. Where possible, the forecasts were verified by comparison with data from clinical interaction studies. The following increases in steady-state plasma concentrations or areas under the plasma concentration-time curve of the oral anticoagulants by concomitant lornoxicam medication were predicted (values in parentheses are for healthy volunteers): (S)-warfarin, 1. 58-fold (1.32-fold for racemate); racemic-acenocoumarol, 1.28-fold (1.09-fold); (R)-acenocoumarol, 1.10-fold (1.0-fold); racemic-phenprocoumon, 1.11-fold (1.18-fold); and (S)-phenprocoumon, 1.13-fold (1.24-fold). Lornoxicam 5'-hydroxylation was competitively inhibited in vitro by both phenprocoumon (K(i) = 1.2 +/- 0.4 microM) and acenocoumarol (K(i) = 5.5 +/- 3.5 microM). The present results indicate that relatively close predictions of the interactions of lornoxicam with oral anticoagulants from in vitro data are possible under the assumption that hepatic lornoxicam concentrations are similar to its total plasma concentrations. The degree of pharmacokinetic interactions exhibited by oral anticoagulants and lornoxicam is dependent on the respective contribution of CYP2C9 to their total clearance.
UCP2 and UCP3 are newly discovered uncoupling proteins, which are thought to underlie the variability in energy metabolism in humans. Mutations in the UCP2 and/or UCP3 gene have been associated with sleeping metabolic rate. Recently we reported that skeletal muscle UCP3 mRNA expression was positively correlated with sleeping metabolic rate in Pima Indians. To study whether genetic variation in the promoter region of UCP3 contributed to the variation in expression of UCP3, we screened part of the proximal promoter region for polymorphisms.
G6PD deficiency is the most common enzymopathy in the world. The highest frequency values are found in tropical Africa, in the Middle East, in some areas of the Mediterranean, in tropical and sub-tropical Asia and in Oceania. This genetic defect shows sex linked inheritance and a marked heterogeneity. At least 400 abnormal variants with different biochemical characteristics and about 100 diverse mutations have been identified. In most cases the phenotypic expression is a marked decrease in erythrocyte G6PD activity. The most common clinical consequences are neonatal jaundice and sporadic haemolytic crises caused by a number of drugs, by infections or by ingestion of fava beans. A few cases of chronic non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia associated with rare molecular variants have been reported. Early diagnosis, education and epidemiologic surveillance have been proved to be cornerstones in the prevention of the haemolytic disease. Therefore they should be taken into account in the national health programmes, especially in the countries with high prevalence rates.
CD38 is expressed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts and its prognostic significance is unknown. We investigated CD38 expression in 304 AML and 138 ALL patients. CD38 was lower in AML-M3 compared to other FAB subtypes (5% vs. 41%; P < 0.001), but was similar among ALL subtypes (56.6%; P = 0.69). Ph + ALL and AML with t(15; 17) patients showed lower CD38 expression than the other cytogenetic groups. Overall survival favored AML and ALL patients with higher CD38 levels. Multivariate analysis revealed CD38 expression to be an independent outcome predictor in AML, but not in ALL.
CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein which is expressed by hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells in human. It has two functions of ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase activities and the sum of these two enzyme activities is identical with NAD glycohydrolase (NADase) activity. The levels of NADase activity in human cervical carcinoma and normal cancer tissue were measured. With a total of 12 patients with cervical cancer and 11 women with normal cervix, cancer tissues were found to have significantly higher NADase and ADP-ribosyl cyclase activities than the control group. Moreover, immunoblot analysis showed an increase of immunoreactivity against CD38 in cervical cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. Immunohistochemical data indicated that the increase of CD38 expression was due to increased infiltration of lymphocytes.
NPR1 is a critical component of the salicylic acid (SA)-mediated signal transduction pathway leading to the induction of defense genes, such as the pathogenesis-related (PR)-1 gene, and enhanced disease resistance. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified several NPR1-interacting proteins (NIPs). Two of these NIPs are members of the TGA/OBF family of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors; this family has been implicated in the activation of SA-responsive genes, including PR-1. Six TGA family members were tested and shown to differentially interact with NPR1: TGA2 and TGA3 showed strong affinity for NPR1; TGA5 and TGA6 exhibited weaker affinity; and TGA1 and TGA4 displayed little or no detectable interaction with NPR1, respectively. Interestingly, the amino-termini of these factors were found to decrease their stability in yeast and differentially affect their apparent affinity toward NPR1. The interacting regions on NPR1 and the TGA factors were also defined. Each of four point mutations in NPR1 that disrupt SA signaling in Arabidopsis completely blocked interaction of NPR1 with TGA2 and TGA3. TGA2 and TGA3 were also found to bind the SA-responsive element of the Arabidopsis PR-1 promoter. These results directly link NPR1 to SA-induced PR-1 expression through members of the TGA family of transcription factors.
"CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of numerous biologically active compounds, including testosterone. A genetic variant located in the P450NF (nifedipine) specific element (NFSE) has been identified that disrupts a transciptional regulatory element located in the 5' regulatory region of CYP3A4. The CYP3A4 variant (CYP3A4-V) is associated with the clinical presentation of prostate cancer. There are significant differences in CYP3A4 metabolism and rates of prostate cancer across ethnic groups that may be associated with CYP3A4 genotypes. Therefore, we estimated the frequency of the CYP3A4 variant in three ethnic groups with different prostate cancer incidence rates. The frequency (q) of CYP3A4-V was significantly different (p<0.0001) in African Americans (q=0.53), U.S. Caucasians (q=0.09), and Taiwanese (q=0.0). CYP3A4-V segregated in a Mendelian manner in one large African American family, and 7 of 16 (44%) biologically unrelated ""marry-ins"" carried a CYP3A4 variant allele. Reflecting population-specific prostate cancer incidence rates, our results suggest a high frequency of this variant in African Americans compared with U.S. Caucasians and Taiwanese."
PGD has now been practised for a decade. The basic techniques currently used involve embryo biopsy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Recent advances in molecular diagnostic techniques have included the use of fluorescent PCR, multiplex PCR and whole genome amplification. For cytogenetic analysis, many centres are now using five or more chromosome probes to examine for chromosome abnormalities, sexing and aneuploidy. Future improvements in molecular diagnosis include the use of quantitative PCR, DNA fingerprinting and microarray technology. Developments in methods to analyse chromosomes from a single cell have included interphase chromosome conversion, which has already been clinically applied, and the use of comparative genomic hybridization, which is still being developed. These methods will hopefully enable more accurate and a greater number of diseases to be diagnosed at the single cell level.
EXT1 and EXT2 are two genes responsible for the majority of cases of hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), a dominantly inherited bone disorder. In order to develop an efficient screening strategy for mutations in these genes, we performed two independent blind screens of EXT1 and EXT2 in 34 unrelated patients with HME, using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and fluorescent single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (F-SSCP). The mutation likely to cause HME was found in 29 (85%) of the 34 probands: in 22 of these (76%), the mutation was in EXT1; seven patients (24%) had EXT2 mutations. Nineteen of these disease mutations have not been previously reported. Of the 42 different amplicon variants identified in total in the cohort, 40 were detected by DHPLC and 39 by F-SSCP. This corresponds to mutation detection efficiencies of 95% and 93% respectively. We have also found that we can confidently distinguish between different sequence variants in the same fragment using F-SSCP but not DHPLC. In light of this, and the similarly high sensitivities of the two techniques, we propose to continue screening with F-SSCP.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 10q23 that encodes a protein and phospholipid phosphatase. Somatic mutations of PTEN are found in a number of human malignancies, and loss of expression, or mutational inactivation of PTEN, leads to the constitutive activation of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt via enhanced phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473. We recently have demonstrated that the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) can phosphorylate PKB/Akt on Ser-473 in a phosphoinositide phospholipid-dependent manner. We now demonstrate that the activity of ILK is constitutively elevated in a serum- and anchorage-independent manner in PTEN-mutant cells, and transfection of wild-type (WT) PTEN into these cells inhibits ILK activity. Transfection of a kinase-deficient, dominant-negative form of ILK or exposure to a small molecule ILK inhibitor suppresses the constitutive phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473, but not on Thr-308, in the PTEN-mutant prostate carcinoma cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP. Transfection of dominant-negative ILK and WT PTEN into these cells also results in the inhibition of PKB/Akt kinase activity. Furthermore, dominant-negative ILK or WT PTEN induces G(1) phase cycle arrest and enhanced apoptosis. Together, these data demonstrate a critical role for ILK in PTEN-dependent cell cycle regulation and survival and indicate that inhibition of ILK may be of significant value in PTEN-mutant tumor therapy.
CAD (caspase-activated DNase) can cause DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells. Transgenic mice that ubiquitously express a caspase-resistant form of the CAD inhibitor (ICAD) were generated. Thymocytes prepared from the mice were resistant to DNA fragmentation induced by a variety of stimuli. However, similar numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were present in adult tissues of transgenic and wild-type mice. Exposure to gamma-irradiation caused a striking increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the thymus of wild-type, but not transgenic, mice. TUNEL-positive nuclei in transgenic mice were confined to thymic macrophages. When apoptotic thymocytes from the transgenic mice were cocultured with macrophages, the thymocytes underwent phagocytosis and their chromosomal DNA underwent fragmentation. This DNA fragmentation was sensitive to inhibitors that block the acidification of lysosomes. Hence, we conclude that the DNA fragmentation that occurs during apoptosis not only can result cell-autonomously from CAD activity but can also be attributed to a lysosomal acid DNase(s), most likely DNase II, after the apoptotic cells are engulfed.
CYP1A2 is a major cytochrome P-450 isoform in the liver and the olfactory mucosa but is essentially not expressed in other tissues. A nuclear factor 1 (NF-1) -like element was identified in the proximal promoter region of rat, mouse, rabbit, and human CYP1A2 genes through data base analysis. In vitro DNase I footprinting with a -211 to +81 probe from the rat CYP1A2 gene and nuclear extracts from rat liver and olfactory mucosa revealed a single protected region corresponding to the NF-1-like element at -129 to -111. Protein binding to this NF-1-like element was tissue-selective and was confirmed by in vivo footprinting in native chromatin from rat liver. Multiple DNA-binding complexes were detected in gel-shift assays using the CYP1A2 NF-1-like element and nuclear extracts from liver and olfactory mucosa, all of which were supershifted in the presence of an anti-NF1 antibody. The NF-1-like element was essential for transcriptional activity of the CYP1A2 gene in an in vitro transcription assay using nuclear extracts from the two tissues. Thus, members of the NF-1 family of transcription factors may play an important role in the tissue-selective expression of the CYP1A2 gene in the liver and olfactory mucosa.
CEL I, isolated from celery, is the first eukaryotic nuclease known that cleaves DNA with high specificity at sites of base-substitution mismatch and DNA distortion. The enzyme requires Mg(2+) and Zn(2+) for activity, with a pH optimum at neutral pH. We have purified CEL I 33 000-fold to apparent homogeneity. A key improvement is the use of alpha-methyl-mannoside in the purification buffers to overcome the aggregation of glycoproteins with endogenous lectins. The SDS gel electrophoresis band for the homogeneous CEL I, with and without the removal of its carbohydrate moieties, was extracted, renatured, and shown to have mismatch cutting specificity. After determination of the amino acid sequence of 28% of the CEL I polypeptide, we cloned the CEL I cDNA. Potential orthologs are nucleases putatively encoded by the genes BFN1 of Arabidopsis, ZEN1 of Zinnia, and DSA6 of daylily. Homologies of CEL I with S1 and P1 nucleases are much lower. We propose that CEL I exemplifies a new family of neutral pH optimum, magnesium-stimulated, mismatch duplex-recognizing nucleases, within the S1 superfamily.
PTEN mutations have been reported to be frequent in endometrioid carinomas of the endometrium (EEC). Some correlation has been found between PTEN mutations and the presence of microsatellite instability (MI) in EEC, but no convincing cause-effect relationship for such association has been offered. DNA of 38 patients with endometrial carcinoma (EC) was extracted from blood and from fresh-frozen and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. PTEN mutations were detected by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. Results were correlated with MI status and clinicopathologic data. PTEN mutations were detected in 17 tumors (44.7%), and they were more frequent in endometrioid (EEC) (17 of 33, 51.5%) than in nonendometrioid carcinomas (NEEC) (0 of 5, 0%). PTEN mutational spectrum differed between MI+ and MItumors. PTEN mutations were detected in 9 of 15 MI+ tumors (60%), but in only 8 of 23 MI- neoplasms (34.8%). In EC with MI, PTEN mutations were detected in short coding mononucleotide repeats (A)s and (A)6 in 4 of 9 carcinomas (44.4%). These results confirm that PTEN is an important target gene in endometrial carcinogenesis. The occurrence of PTEN mutations in short coding mononucleotide repeats in MI-positive tumors suggests that these mutations may be secondary to deficiencies in mismatch repair and gives some explanation for the frequent presence of PTEN mutations in these tumors.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in human cancers. Although many mutations target the phosphatase domain, others create a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif or a protein that extends beyond the PDZ-binding motif. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated a membrane-associated guanylate kinase family protein with multiple PDZ domains [AIP-1 (atrophin interacting protein 1), renamed MAGI-2 (membrane associated guanylate kinase inverted-2)]. MAGI-2 contains eight potential protein-protein interaction domains and is localized to tight junctions in the membrane of epithelial cells. PTEN binds to MAGI-2 through an interaction between the PDZ-binding motif of PTEN and the second PDZ domain of MAGI-2. MAGI-2 enhances the ability of PTEN to suppress Akt activation. Furthermore, certain PTEN mutants have reduced stability, which is restored by adding the minimal PDZ-binding motif back to the truncated protein. We propose that MAGI-2 improves the efficiency of PTEN signaling through assembly of a multiprotein complex at the cell membrane.
CD36 is one of the major receptors for oxidized low density lipoproteins belonging to macrophage (Mphi) scavenger receptor (SR) class B and is thought to play an important role in the foam cell formation from monocyte-Mphi in the atherosclerotic lesions. Although it has been hypothesized that smooth muscle cells (SMCs) may be the other origin of foam cells in vivo, supporting data are still very limited. In the present study, we have tested the expression of a variety of SRs, including CD36, in 8 lots of primary human aortic SMCs (HASMCs) explanted from 8 different donors. Functional CD36 was expressed in cultured HASMCs, and the levels of expression were widely ranged between the lots. SR class A (SR-A) was expressed abundantly in CD36-negative lots. Other Mphi markers, such as CD32 and CD68, were expressed in all lots tested. These data suggest that the cultured HASMCs gained an Mphi-like phenotype. To determine the mechanism for the above-described phenotypic change, we have tested the expression of a nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma, in those cells. This nuclear receptor was abundantly expressed in CD36-positive lots, whereas c-fms was expressed abundantly in CD36-negative/SR-A-positive lots. The synthetic ligand of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma, troglitazone, upregulated the expression of CD36 only in CD36-positive lots. These observations demonstrate that cultured HASMCs can gain an Mphi-like phenotype, possibly classified by the expression of CD36 or SR-A. The present study may support the possibilities of transformation of HASMCs into foam cells in vivo.
PTEN is a newly isolated candidate tumor suppressor gene and its mutation is the most frequently found in endometrial cancer (EC), a very common female pelvic malignant disease. Mutations of the KRAS gene are also reported in this disease. Recent analysis of the PTEN protein suggested the possibility that this protein acts in the same pathway as does the RAS protein. To elucidate this possibility further, we performed a mutation analysis of these two genes in 44 endometrial cancer specimens (38 primary tumors and 6 cell lines). Altogether 23 (52%) of 44 tumors had mutations in either PTEN or KRAS, but none of them had mutations in both of these genes. These results support the idea that the protein products of these two genes act in the same growth regulatory pathway in the endometrium.
CD38 is a bifunctional ectoenzyme predominantly expressed on hematopoietic cells where its expression correlates with differentiation and proliferation. The two enzyme activities displayed by CD38 are an ADP-ribosyl cyclase and a cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR) hydrolase that catalyzes the synthesis and hydrolysis of cADPR. T lymphocytes can be induced to express CD38 when activated with antibodies against specific antigen receptors. If the activated T cells are then exposed with NAD, cell death by apoptosis occurs. During the exposure of activated T cells to NAD, the CD38 is modified by ecto-mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (ecto-mono-ADPRTs) specific for cysteine and arginine residues. Arginine-ADP-ribosylation results in inactivation of both cyclase and hydrolase activities of CD38, whereas cysteine-ADP-ribosylation results only in the inhibition of the hydrolase activity. The arginine-ADP-ribosylation causes a decrease in intracellular cADPR and a subsequent decrease in Ca(2+) influx, resulting in apoptosis of the activated T cells. Our results suggest that the interaction of two classes of ecto-ADP-ribose transfer enzymes plays an important role in immune regulation by the selective induction of apoptosis in activated T cells and that cADPR mediated signaling is essential for the survival of activated T cells.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor with sequence homology to protein-tyrosine phosphatases and the cytoskeleton protein tensin. PTEN is capable of dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3,4, 5-trisphosphate in vitro and down-regulating its levels in insulin-stimulated 293 cells. To study the role of PTEN in insulin signaling, we overexpressed PTEN in 3T3-L1 adipocytes approximately 30-fold above uninfected or control virus (green fluorescent protein)-infected cells, using an adenovirus gene transfer system. PTEN overexpression inhibited insulin-induced 2-deoxy-glucose uptake by 36%, GLUT4 translocation by 35%, and membrane ruffling by 50%, all of which are phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent processes, compared with uninfected cells or cells infected with control virus. Microinjection of an anti-PTEN antibody increased basal and insulin stimulated GLUT4 translocation, suggesting that inhibition of endogenous PTEN function led to an increase in intracellular phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate levels, which stimulates GLUT4 translocation. Further, insulin-induced phosphorylation of downstream targets Akt and p70S6 kinase were also inhibited significantly by overexpression of PTEN, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 or the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase were not affected, suggesting that the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway remains fully functional. Thus, we conclude that PTEN may regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent insulin signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
CD38 is a ubiquitous protein originally identified as a lymphocyte antigen and recently also found to be a multifunctional enzyme participating in the synthesis and metabolism of two Ca(2+) messengers, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate. It is homologous to Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase, where the crystal structure has been determined. Residues of CD38 corresponding to those at the active site of the Aplysia cyclase were mutagenized. Changing Glu-226, which corresponded to the catalytic residue of the cyclase, to Asp, Asn, Gln, Leu, or Gly eliminated essentially all enzymatic activities of CD38, indicating it is most likely the catalytic residue. Photoaffinity labeling showed that E226G, nevertheless, retained substantial NAD binding activity. The secondary structures of these inactive mutants as measured by circular dichroism were essentially unperturbed as compared with the wild type. Other nearby residues were also investigated. The mutants D147V and E146L showed 7- and 19-fold reduction in NADase activity, respectively. The cADPR hydrolase activity of the two mutants was similarly reduced. Asp-155, on the other hand, was crucial for the GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity since its substitution with either Glu, Asn, or Gln stimulated the activity 3-15-fold, whereas other activities remained essentially unchanged. In addition to these acidic residues, two tryptophans were also important, since all enzyme activities of W125F, W125Y, W189G and W189Y were substantially reduced. This is consistent with the two tryptophans serving a substrate positioning function. A good correlation was observed when the NADase activity of all the mutants was plotted against the cADPR hydrolase activity. Homology modeling revealed all these critical residues are clustered in a pocket near the center of the CD38 molecule. The results indicate a strong structural homology between the active sites of CD38 and the Aplysia cyclase.
CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein found on both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. It is known for its involvement in the metabolism of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate, two nucleotides with calcium mobilizing activity independent of inositol trisphosphate. It is generally believed that CD38 is an integral protein with ectoenzymatic activities found mainly on the plasma membrane. Here we show that enzymatically active CD38 is present intracellularly on the nuclear envelope of rat hepatocytes. CD38 isolated from rat liver nuclei possessed both ADP-ribosyl cyclase and NADase activity. Immunofluorescence studies on rat liver cryosections and isolated nuclei localized CD38 to the nuclear envelope of hepatocytes. Subcellular localization via immunoelectron microscopy showed that CD38 is located on the inner nuclear envelope. The isolated nuclei sequestered calcium in an ATP-dependent manner. cADPR elicited a rapid calcium release from the loaded nuclei, which was independent of inositol trisphosphate and was inhibited by 8-amino-cADPR, a specific antagonist of cADPR, and ryanodine. However, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate failed to elicit any calcium release from the nuclear calcium stores. The nuclear localization of CD38 shown in this study suggests a novel role of CD38 in intracellular calcium signaling for non-hematopoietic cells.
CYP3A4 present in small bowel enterocytes can catalyze substantial metabolism of some orally administered drugs and, thus, exerts a first-pass effect. Recent data indicate that the P-glycoprotein (the MDR 1 gene product) in the enterocyte brush border also limits the bioavailability of many of the same drugs that interact with CYP3A. It has been proposed that P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 may be functionally linked because (a) the two proteins are co-localized within the digestive tract and within enterocytes, (b) they share many of the same substrates and (c) they are co-inducible in response to at least some xenobiotics. There are several potential mechanisms whereby the functions of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 could be complimentary. First, Pgp may limit absorption in the proximal small bowel, shifting it to more distal, less catalytically efficient segments that contain lower amounts of CYP3A4. Second, Pgp may function to prolong the duration of absorption. This might increase the duration of exposure of drug to and, hence, the extent of metabolism by enterocyte CYP3A4. Finally, Pgp may preferentially remove from the enterocyte primary drug metabolites that are themselves substrates for CYP3A4. This would limit product inhibition and facilitate primary metabolism catalyzed by CYP3A4. Characterization of the roles of CYP3A4 and Pgp in limiting oral drug availability may be aided by recent success in the development of human intestinal cell lines that stably express both CYP3A4 and Pgp.
PTEN tumor suppressor gene mutations are the most frequent genetic lesions in endometrial adenocarcinomas of the endometrioid subtype. Testing the hypothesis that altered PTEN function precedes the appearance of endometrial adenocarcinoma has been difficult, however, partly because of uncertainties in precancer diagnosis.
DCK lactam analogues were synthesized and evaluated for anti-HIV activity against HIV-1 replication in H9 lymphocyte cells. 4-Methyl-DCK lactam (11a) exhibited potent anti-HIV activity with EC50 and therapeutic index values of 0.00024 microM and 119,333, respectively.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene and its mutation is frequently found in endometrial carcinoma. Recently, the pseudogene of PTEN has been reported to be actively transcribed in a number of cells and tissues and a potential for translation is suggested. For further understanding of the involvement of PTEN in endometrial carcinogenesis, we analysed the expressions of PTEN and the pseudogene in 36 endometrial carcinomas with special reference to the genetic status of PTEN. Mutations of PTEN were found in 42% (15/36) of the endometrial carcinomas. The transcript of the pseudogene was expressed in 6 samples (17%) of 36 endometrial carcinomas, but in none of the normal endometria. Western blot analysis showed no translated protein of the pseudogene in any of the cases. Steady level of PTEN protein expression was observed in all the cases examined. Expression level was consistent among the proliferative endometria, secretory endometria and endometrial carcinomas as long as PTEN protein was not truncated. These results indicate that PTEN is a constitutive protein in the endometrium, so that the somatic mutation of PTEN exerts a crucial effect on the endometrial carcinogenesis. In addition, the presence of the PTEN pseudogene transcript urges us caution for the mutational analysis of PTEN as well as careful choice of the probe for the detection of PTEN transcript.
CAD methods may provide radiologists with tools to obtain more accurate diagnoses for lung cancer. Considerable effort has been devoted to developing CAD tools for CXR; however, these are limited by the fundamental constraints of the projective CXR modality. CT provides far more detailed information that can be exploited better by CAD systems. There has been very little work done in this area to date, although the basic technology has already been developed through the more extensive research in the computer vision areas supported by industry and the military. Initial prototype CT CAD systems have been described that are highly effective in detecting small pulmonary nodules and in predicting malignancy of nodules. CT is now achieving momentum in the study of lung cancer. It has taken time for this modality to gain acceptance because of several factors: higher radiation dose, higher cost, and the novelty of use in this application. It is important to note that the technology for CT scanners is still rapidly evolving. As the speed, resolution, and cost of CT scanners continue to improve, computer techniques for the measurement and analysis of nodules will also achieve corresponding improvements in accuracy and diagnostic utility. Future knowledge-based CT CAD systems will provide detailed analysis of the related conditions of the lungs, such as emphysema, and diagnostic analysis of nodules. The issue is not whether CAD will improve the performance and capabilities of the radiologist, but at what rate their development and the corresponding improvement will occur. Current prototype CAD systems may be considered as tools. As such they will improve the performance of the user/radiologist if they are well engineered and if the user understands their capabilities and limitations. These systems need to be improved by knowledge-based engineering, which is notoriously difficult to implement robustly and requires model refinement and optimization based on a large database of cases. Research should be directed at developing these methods rather than comparing prototype systems with current practices. Future performance should be expected to exceed that of today's grand masters.
GSTM1 and GSTT1 are polymorphic genes. Absence of enzyme activity is due to homozygous inherited deletion of the gene, reducing detoxification of carcinogens such as epoxides and alkylating agents and potentially increasing cancer risk. We hypothesized that GST null genotype would increase risk of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasia (AML/MDS) in children. DNA was extracted from bone marrow slides of 292 AML/MDS patients. PCR amplification was used to assign GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes for cases and controls. Given that the frequency of the null genotype varies by ethnicity and that the majority of the cases were Caucasian, analyses were restricted to 232 white (non-Hispanic) cases and 153 Caucasian non cancer controls. The frequency of GSTM1 null was significantly increased in AML/MDS cases compared with controls [64 versus 47%; odds ratio (OR), 2.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-3.1]; P = 0.001], whereas the frequency of GSTT1 null genotype in AML/MDS cases was not statistically different from controls. AML comprises biologically distinct subtypes, and a test for homogeneity revealed a statistically significant difference among subtypes (P = 0.04; df, 8) for GSTM1 only. In particular, there was an increased frequency of GSTM1 null genotypes in French-American-British groups M3 [82%; n = 22; OR, 5.1 (95% CI, 1.6-21.3)] and M4 [72%; n = 53; OR, 2.9 (95% CI, 1.4-6.0)]. We conclude that the GSTM1 null genotype is a significant risk factor for childhood AML, particularly French-American-British groups M3 and M4. This may indicate an important role for exogenous carcinogens in the etiology of childhood AML.
ACE inhibitors have shown beneficial results in several studies after myocardial infarction (MI). However, these studies have shown conflicting results about the ideal starting time of the ACE inhibitors administration after MI and the importance of infarct size.
CD36 is a membrane glycoprotein and a putative scavenger receptor expressed by several cell types. In capillary endothelial cells, it mediates the adherence of erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum. The CD36 sequence contains two hydrophobic domains located at the amino-and carboxyl-termini of the protein, but the topology of this protein and the functional significance of these domains are still not clearly defined. We generated soluble CD36-IgG chimeric molecules by fusion of the extracellular domains of CD36 with human immunoglobulin domains. The construct containing the N-terminal hydrophobic domain of CD36 was completely retained intracellularly as membrane-associated molecule, suggesting that the N-terminal hydrophobic domain of the CD36 is a real transmembrane domain and that CD36 has hairpin topology. A small amount of the CD36-IgG chimeric construct lacking both transmembrane domains escaped retention, was correctly processed, and accumulated in the extracellular medium as a soluble molecule. This CD36-IgG construct failed to bind Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Using monoclonal antibodies specific for either conformational or structural epitopes, we demonstrate that failure of this CD36-IgG construct to bind infected erythrocytes was due to incorrect folding of the soluble chimeric molecule.
ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blockers are effective in reducing left ventricular mass in hypertension and heart failure. However, the ability of these drugs to reverse excessive myocyte lengthening and transverse growth in heart failure is unknown.
LCT lipid emulsions and even more fish oil-containing lipid emulsions are under debate regarding their tocopherol and PUFA content as well as their effect on the antioxidative status especially in patients with oxidative stress.
PTEN is one of the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancer. PTEN mutations have been implicated in the development of a variety of human neoplasia, including high-grade glioblastoma, prostate, breast, endometrial, and thyroid carcinoma. Germ-line mutations of PTEN cause Cowden's syndrome (CS), a multiple hamartoma condition resulting in increased susceptibility for the development of cancer. When more than 6 months old, pten+/- mice develop a range of tumors, partially resembling the spectrum of neoplasia observed in CS patients. One-half (32 of 65) of pten+/- females developed breast tumors, whereas all (65 of 65) of the females had endometrial hyperplasia, and there was a high incidence (14 of 65) of endometrial cancer. Hamartoamous tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as prostate and adrenal neoplasia, were also frequently observed. Significantly, the spectrum of neoplasia observed in pten+/- mice partially overlaps with the types of tumors frequently detected in CS patients. The majority of tumors in pten+/- mice exhibit loss of heterozygosity at the pten locus, which indicates the importance for loss of PTEN function in tumor formation. Consistent with the role of PTEN in negative regulation of PKB/Akt phosphorylation and activity, pten loss of heterozygosity is accompanied by hyperphosphorylation of PKB/Akt in tumors. Taken together, our results establish pten+/- mice as an excellent animal model system for the investigation of PTEN-related hamartoma syndromes, as well as the role of PTEN in breast and endometrial carcinogenesis.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten), a recently discovered tumor suppressor gene, appears to negatively control the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway for regulation of cell proliferation and cell survival by dephosphorylating the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. To date, 110 germline PTEN mutations have been reported in patients affected with two tumor predisposing syndromes, each having overlapping clinical features: Cowden disease and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. These germline mutations are scattered along the length of the gene, with the exception of exon 9 (no mutation reported) and exon 1 (only two mutations reported). A mutational hot spot is found in exon 5, which encodes the phosphatase catalytic core motif, and recurrent mutations are also found at CpG dinucleotides suggesting deamination-induced mutations. PTEN has also been found to be defective in a large number of sporadic human tumors. In this article, 332 somatic point mutations of PTEN, occurring in primary tumors or metastasis, have been reviewed. Somatic PTEN mutations are more particularly involved in two types of human cancers: endometrial carcinomas and glioblastomas. In most cases, these somatic mutations result in protein inactivation and, as with germline mutations, recurrent somatic mutations are found in CpG dinucleotides. A mutagenesis by insertion-deletion in repetitive elements is however specifically observed in endometrial carcinomas.
ABO (H) blood group antigens are covalently linked to the oligosaccharide side-chains of von Willebrand factor (VWF). In this study, we investigated the role of the A and B antigens in the expression of VWF adhesive activity. VWF of type A, B or O was purified from fresh frozen plasma. Presence of A or B antigen on the VWF was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-A or anti-B. The A or B antigen was also detected in the 48/52-kDa fragment of the respective VWF after trypsin digestion. Removal of A antigen with alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase or B antigen with alpha-galactosidase did not affect its multimer size or antigenic level, but decreased the ristocetin cofactor (RCoF) activity of the respective VWF by 33-39% (P < 0.01-0.002). Removal of A or B antigen from VWF did not affect the binding of the VWF to immobilized type III collagen. A and B antigens were not detected in platelet VWF. These results indicate that AB structures play a role in platelet aggregating activity of VWF.
CYP2D6 exhibits genetic polymorphism with interindividual differences in metabolic activity. We have found a significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine by the CYP2D6*10 allele in a Japanese population. CYP2D6.10, which is translated from CYP2D6*10, has two amino acid substitutions: Pro34 --> Ser and Ser486 --> Thr. In this study, CYP2D6.10 was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its catalytic activity for CYP2D6 substrates was investigated. The CYP2D6*10B- and *10C-associated cDNA were isolated from human lymphocyte genotyped as CYP2D6*10. In addition, three forms of CYP2D6, Pro34/Thr486 (PT), Ser34/Ser486 (SS), and Pro34/Ser486 (wild type, CYP2D6.1), were constructed by PCR-site mutagenesis to clarify the effects of the two amino-acid substitutions. The expression of CYP2D6 protein was confirmed by immunoblotting using CYP2D antibody. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured by CO-reduced difference spectra from five all microsome preparations. The CYP2D6 forms with Pro34 --> Ser amino acid substitution were at a lower expression than CYP2D6.1 from the findings of immunoblotting and spectral analysis. The apparent K(m) values of CYP2D6.1, CYP2D6.10A, and CYP2D6.10C were 1.7, 8.5, and 49.7 microM, respectively, for bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation, and 9.0, 51.9, and 117.4 microM, respectively, for venlafaxine O-demethylation, respectively. The V(max) values were not significantly different among the three variants. These findings suggest that the decreased in vivo clearance by CYP2D6*10 was caused not only by low expression of but also the increased K(m) value of CYP2D6.
ATIC [5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (AICAR Tfase)-inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (IMPCH)] is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the penultimate and final steps in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway and thus is an attractive anticancer target. Recombinant avian ATIC has been purified from an Escherichia coli expression system and crystallized in a binary complex with methotrexate (MTX). Crystals were obtained from PEG 4000 or MPEG 5000 buffered at pH 7.0-7.2 and data were collected from a single crystal at 96 K to 2.3 A resolution at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL). The crystals are monoclinic and belong to space group P2(1), with unit-cell dimensions a = 65.17, b = 105.93, c = 103.47 A, beta = 108.27 degrees. Assuming two molecules per asymmetric unit, the Matthews coefficient V(m) is 2.63 A(3) Da(-1) and the solvent volume is 52.9%.
CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), MDR1 (multidrug resistance), and MRP1 (multidrug resistance-associated protein), members of the ABC transporter superfamily, possess multiple functions, particularly Cl(-), anion, and glutathione conjugate transport and cell detoxification. They are also hypothesized to have a number of complementary functions. It is generally accepted that data obtained from nasal mucosa can be extrapolated to lower airway cell physiology. The aim of the present study was to investigate by immunohistochemistry the differential localization of CFTR, MDR1, and MRP1 in the normal mucosa of 10 human nasal turbinates. In ciliated epithelial cells, CFTR was inconstantly expressed at the apical cell surface, intense membranous labeling was observed for MDR1, and intense cytoplasmic labeling was observed for MRP1. In the glands, a higher level of expression was observed on serous cells, at the apical surface (for CFTR), on lateral membranes (for MDR1), and with an intracytoplasmic distribution (for MRP1). In conclusion, CFTR, MDR1 and MRP1 are expressed in the epithelium and glands of the nasal respiratory mucosa, but with different patterns of expression. These results suggest major roles for CFTR, MDR1, and MRP1 in serous glandular cells and a protective function for MDR1 and MRP1 in respiratory ciliated cells.

PDE10A is a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) exhibiting properties of a cAMP PDE and a cAMP-inhibited cGMP PDE. The transcripts are specifically expressed in the striatum. The human gene encoding PDE10A was cloned and investigated. The PDE10A gene spanned > 200 kb and contained 24 exons. The exon-intron organization of PDE10A was different from those of PDE5A and PDE6B, although these three PDEs include two GAF domains and have similar amino-acid sequences. The promoter sequence of PDE10A was highly GC-rich and did not contain a TATA motif and a CAAT box, suggesting it is a housekeeping gene. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the C32E12.2 gene encoding a probable PDE that is 48% identical to the human PDE10A protein showed similar exon organization to PDE10A but not PDE5A and PDE6B. This, together with the phylogenic tree analysis, suggested that the ancestral gene for PDE10A existed in a lower organism such as C. elegans.
ACE polymorphism, especially genotype DD or D allele, may be involved in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. It may also have different effects on the reduction of proteinuria by ACE inhibitors in patients with proteinuria. We investigated the relationship between ACE gene polymorphism and antiproteinuric effect of ACE inhibitors (Benazepril 10 mg/day or Perindopril 4 mg/day) in 83 NIDDM patients with overt proteinuria (urinary protein excretion over 500 mg/day).
CYP2C19 has an important role in the catabolism of several proton pump inhibitors. However, the relative contribution of CYP2C19-mediated metabolism varies among the different proton pump inhibitors.
CD36 deficiency was studied with attention to the phenotype-genotype relationship. The diagnosis of CD36 deficiency was made when CD36 was negative on platelets (type II) or on both platelets and monocytes (type I). Among 827 apparently healthy Japanese volunteers, the type I and II deficiencies were found in 8 (1.0%) and 48 (5.8%), respectively. The T for C substitution at nt478 for Pro90Ser and the insertion of A at nt 1159 constituted the major causes of type I and II deficiencies. The dinucleotide deletion at nt539 had a minor role. In two family studies, we found a previously unreported polymorphic site in the 5'-proximal flanking region and the 3'-untranslated region. Including these new polymorphisms, DNA sequence other than the three known mutations affecting CD36 expression was not observed in the CD36 gene, calling into question the previous hypothesis that a platelet-specific silent allele exists near or at the CD36 gene.
CYP2E1 has been reported to have an essential role in alcohol-mediated increases in hepatic steatosis and acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. We found that pretreatment of Cyp2e1(-/-) mice with ethanol plus isopentanol, the predominant alcohols in alcoholic beverages, for 7 days resulted in micro- and macrovesicular steatosis in the livers of all mice, as well as a dramatic increase in acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. In Cyp2e1(-/-) mice administered up to 600 mg acetaminophen/kg alone and euthanized 7 h later, there was no increase in serum levels of ALT. In Cyp2e1(-/-) mice pretreated with ethanol and isopentanol, subsequent exposure to 400 or 600 mg acetaminophen/kg resulted in centrilobular necrosis in all mice with maximal elevation in serum levels of ALT. Acetaminophen-mediated liver damage was similar in males and females. Hepatic microsomal levels of APAP activation in untreated females were similar to those in males treated with the alcohols. However, the females, like the males, required pretreatment with the alcohols in order to increase APAP hepatotoxicity. These findings suggest that, in the Cyp2e1(-/-) mice, the alcohol-mediated increase in acetaminophen hepatotoxicity involves the contribution of other factors, in addition to induction of CYP(s) that activate acetaminophen. Alternatively, CYP-mediated activation of acetaminophen measured in vitro may not reflect the actual activity in vivo. Our findings that a 7-day treatment with ethanol and isopentanol causes extensive hepatic steatosis and increases acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in Cyp2e(-/-) mice indicate that CYP2E1 is not essential for either response.
CLC chloride channels comprise a gene family with nine mammalian members. Probably all CLC channels form homodimers, and some CLC proteins may also associate to heterodimers. ClC-0 and ClC-1, the only CLC channels investigated at the single-channel level, display two conductances of equal size which are thought to result from two separate pores, formed individually by the two monomers. We generated concatemeric channels containing one subunit of ClC-0 together with one subunit of ClC-1 or ClC-2. They should display two different conductances if one monomer were sufficient to form one pore. Indeed, we found a 8-picosiemens (pS) conductance (corresponding to ClC-0) that was associated with either a 1.8-pS (ClC-1) or a 2.8-pS (ClC-2) conductance. These conductances retained their typical gating, but the slow gating of ClC-0 that affects both pores simultaneously was lost. ClC-2 and ClC-0 current components were modified by point mutations in the corresponding subunit. The ClC-2 single pore of the mixed dimer was compared with the pores in the ClC-2 homodimer and found to be unaltered. We conclude that each monomer individually forms a gated pore. CLC dimers in general must be imagined as having two pores, as shown previously for ClC-0.
CD36 has been associated with diverse normal and pathologic processes. These include scavenger receptor functions (uptake of apoptotic cells and modified lipid), lipid metabolism and fatty acid transport, adhesion, angiogenesis, modulation of inflammation, transforming growth factor-beta activation, atherosclerosis, diabetes and cardiomyopathy. Although CD36 was identified more than 25 years ago, it is only with the advent of recent genetic technology that in-vivo evidence has emerged for its physiologic and pathologic relevance. As these in-vivo studies are expanded, we will gain further insight into the mechanism(s) by which CD36 transmits a cellular signal, and this will allow the design of specific therapeutics that impact on a particular function of CD36.
PTEN is a candidate tumor suppressor gene for mutations which are responsible for Cowden disease. Recently, it has been shown that PTEN is mutated in several human neoplasms. To investigate the role of PTEN in tumorigenesis, we screened its mutation in Japanese patients with gastrointestinal polyposis and various sporadic tumors.
CYP11A1 gene encodes the P450scc enzyme. which catalyzes the first step of steroidogenesis under the modulation of cAMP signal. To understand the signaling pathway of cAMP, we analyzed three elements in upstream cAMP-responsive sequences of CYP11A1 gene. The sequence of -1617/-1609 fragment was identical to the conserved SF1 binding site (SF1/Ad4BP). Both sequences of -1637/-1626 and -1559/-1545 fragments are highly homologous to consensus TRE or CRE. The cAMP-treated adrenal Y1 nuclear extracts formed significantly higher intensities of complexes with these three elements than untreated Y1 nuclear extracts. The EMSA demonstrated potential binding of SF1 protein to -1617/-1609, and CREB like protein and AP1 family to -1637/-1626 and -1559/-1545. This is the first report to describe the enhancement of cAMP on protein binding activities of three elements of CYP11A1 promoter to SF1/Ad4BP or CREB/AP1-like proteins.
MTR and T1 relaxation times are abnormal in MS lesions and NAWM, and may reflect tissue damage such as demyelination and axonal loss. Their relationship and potential to provide complementary information in tissue characterisation is explored. The aim of this study was to document the relationship between magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) and T1 relaxation time in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in order to determine whether the combination provides a more comprehensive tissue characterisation than either parameter in isolation. Ten patients with relapsing remitting MS and 10 age matched healthy controls underwent imaging using a protocol which included the measurement of both MTR and T1 relaxation times. The MTR and T1 values were compared statistically using a commonly adopted correlation approach and a mixed-model regression approach. There was a strong correlation between MTR and T1 in MS lesions (r=0.74). The correlation was seen equally in T1 hypointense and isointense lesions. The relationship was much weaker in MS NAWM (r=0.24) and no correlation was found in control white matter (r=0.06). Mixed-model regression analysis confirmed that the relationship between T1 and MTR is strongly dependent upon tissue type (MS lesion, MS NAWM, or control white matter). The relationship between MTR and T1 relaxation time measurements varies markedly between pathological and normal tissue types. In MS, the complementary information obtained from MTR and T1 is most apparent in NAWM. The results emphasise the potential for combinations of MR parameters to improve tissue characterisation, which in turn should improve understanding of disease pathology and treatment monitoring.

PTEN acts as a tumor suppressor, at least in part, by antagonizing phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling. Here we show that Forkhead transcription factors FKHRL1 and FKHR, substrates of the Akt kinase, are aberrantly localized to the cytoplasm and cannot activate transcription in PTEN-deficient cells. Restoration of PTEN function restores FKHR to the nucleus and restores transcriptional activation. Expression of a constitutively active form of FKHR that cannot be phosphorylated by Akt produces the same effect as reconstitution of PTEN on PTEN-deficient tumor cells. Specifically, activated FKHR induces apoptosis in cells that undergo PTEN-mediated cell death and induces G(1) arrest in cells that undergo PTEN-mediated cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, both PTEN and constitutively active FKHR induce p27(KIP1) protein but not p21. These data suggest that Forkhead transcription factors are critical effectors of PTEN-mediated tumor suppression.
GPI 6150 (1,11b-dihydro-[2H]benzopyrano[4,3,2-de]isoquinolin-3-one) is a novel inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). It has demonstrated efficacy in rodent models of focal cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine damage to dopaminergic neurons, regional myocardial ischemia, streptozotocin-induced diabetes, septic shock, and arthritis. Here we report the structure of GPI 6150, its enzymatic characteristics, and biochemical property in cytoprotection. As a competitive PARP inhibitor (K(i) = 60 nM), GPI 6150 protected the P388D1 cells against hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity, by preventing PARP activation and the depletion of NAD(+), the substrate for PARP. To address the concerns of potential side effects of PARP inhibition, we tested GPI 6150 and found it had no effect on the repair and expression of a plasmid DNA damaged by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Neither did it affect dehydrogenases with NAD co-enzyme. GPI 6150 was much less potent to inhibit mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase. There was no selectivity for GPI 6150 between PARP isozymes. These attributes render GPI 6150 a useful tool to probe the functions of PARP.
CA1 pyramidal neurons are highly vulnerable to transient cerebral ischemia. In vivo studies have shown that the excitability of CA1 neurons progressively decreased following reperfusion. To reveal the mechanisms underlying the postischemic excitability change, total potassium current, transient potassium current, and delayed rectifier potassium current in CA1 neurons were studied in hippocampal slices prepared before ischemia and at different time points following reperfusion. Consistent with previous in vivo studies, the excitability of CA1 neurons decreased in brain slices prepared at 14 h following transient forebrain ischemia. The amplitude of total potassium current in CA1 neurons increased approximately 30% following reperfusion. The steady-state activation curve of total potassium current progressively shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction with a transient recovery at 18 h after ischemia. For transient potassium current, the amplitude was transiently increased approximately 30% at approximately 12 h after reperfusion and returned to control levels at later time points. The steady-state activation curve also shifted approximately 20 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction, and the time constant of removal of inactivation markedly increased at 12 h after reperfusion. For delayed rectifier potassium current, the amplitude significantly increased and the steady-state activation curve shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction at 36 h after reperfusion. No significant change in inactivation kinetics was observed in the above potassium currents following reperfusion. The present study demonstrates the differential changes of potassium currents in CA1 neurons after reperfusion. The increase of transient potassium current in the early phase of reperfusion may be responsible for the decrease of excitability, while the increase of delayed rectifier potassium current in the late phase of reperfusion may be associated with the postischemic cell death.
PDE11A is a dual-substrate, cAMP and cGMP, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE). Presently four unique variants carrying distinct GAF sequences in the N-terminal region have been identified. While human PDE11A3 and PDE11A4 are known to be specifically expressed in testis and prostate, respectively, PDE11A1 was mainly detected in skeletal muscle. The human PDE11A gene was investigated and revealed to span > 300 kb, contain 23 exons and be mapped on chromosome 2q31. The transcription start sites of PDE11A1, PDE11A3 and PDE11A4 were determined, and the promoter sequences were revealed. Although 5' flanking genomic regions of PDE11A1 and PDE11A3 had a consensus TATA motif, that of PDE11A4 was a TATA-less but contained CCAAT box and Sp1-binding sequence. Interestingly, we found that the exon 2 sequence for N-terminal region of PDE11A3 encoded an N-terminal sequence of the cytochrome c pseudogene in an alternate reading frame, and that C-terminal region of the cytochrome c pseudogene in intron 2 was disrupted by the insertion of Alu repetitive sequence. Furthermore, we examined the exon-intron organization of the PDE2A gene and compared the exon organization among GAF-PDE family. The exon organization of the PDE11A catalytic domain was very similar to those of PDE5A and PDE6B. However, other GAF-PDEs, PDE2A and PDE10A, displayed different exon organization from PDE11A although these three PDEs are similar in their amino-acid sequences to each other. The findings suggested that PDE11A has a common ancestral gene with PDE5A and PDE6s, whereas PDE2A and PDE10A are generated separately from these three GAF-PDEs.
ACE polymorphisms have recently been shown to associate with worse renal and or cardiovascular outcome, with the D allele widely reported as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), there are conflicting reports of an association between ACE polymorphisms and disease phenotype. There are no previous reports of any association between angiotensinogen polymorphisms and clinical phenotype in ADPKD. We examined the ACE I/D and angiotensinogen M235T polymorphisms in 176 patients with ADPKD. Patients are categorized into three groups according to the reason for initial investigation. Clinical history and examination findings were recorded at the time of first referral. A cohort of 17 patients had progressive renal impairment observed after 3 or more years of follow-up. Reciprocal creatinine against time was plotted in this group. From the patient population of 176, a total of 33 patients reached end-stage renal failure (ESRF) or a serum creatinine greater than 500 microm/liter. ACE genotype and M235T polymorphism frequencies were compared across groups. Serum creatinine and presence of hypertension and onset of ESRF were taken as outcome variables; age and source of referral were taken as confounding variables. There was no association of any genotype or allele with either creatinine, inverse creatinine, hypertension, or age at end-stage renal failure. These findings do not support the proposition that ACE genotype or angiotensinogen polymorphisms are associated with a worse prognosis in patients with ADPKD.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in brain, prostate, and uterine cancer. It acts as a phosphoinositide phosphatase and consists of an amino-terminal phosphatase domain tightly linked to a COOH-terminal C2 domain involved in lipid membrane-binding. We investigated the functions of the C2 domain and their relevance for tumor growth. To discriminate between PTEN C2 domain ability to recruit or to position the active site to the membrane, we artificially membrane-targeted PTEN by a myristoylation signal. This modification increased wild-type PTEN growth inhibition but did not rescue a C2 mutant defective in lipid-binding, suggesting a model in which PTEN C2 domain positions the active site productively with respect to the membrane-bound phosphoinositide substrate. When tumor-derived mutations in the loops that connect the C2 beta-strands were analyzed, we found that these generally destabilized the protein but had variable effects on the phosphatase activity and tumor growth. The magnitude of these effects was dependent on the presence of the COOH-terminal PEST sequences and on the cell type where the mutant proteins were expressed, suggesting the existence of fluctuating structural defects of the mutant protein. One of the C2 loop mutants induced a total loss of PTEN tumor-suppressor function, most likely by affecting both the membrane binding and the protein stability. These data support a double role for PTEN C2 domain in protein stability and in productive orientation of the catalytic site.
ACE inhibition after myocardial infarction (MI) has been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiac anatomy and function. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of ACE inhibition on cardiac gene expression after MI.
ABO incompatibility is a common cause for mild hemolysis in the newborn, ranging from 1 in 30 to 1 in 150 births. Fortunately, hemolysis requiring transfusion is rare and restricted to blood group O mothers, because blood group A and B individuals make poor IgG anti-B and anti-A responses. No human IgG ABO antibody sequences have been reported, in part because of the difficulty in obtaining human IgG hybridomas. Phage-display technology may be able to circumvent these difficulties, but its application to carbohydrate antigens is poorly studied.
PDE5A gene encodes type 5 phosphodiesterase (PDE5), the principal cGMP-catalyzing enzyme in the penis and the primary target of sildenafil (Viagra). We have isolated a 3.7-kb DNA fragment that contains the human PDE5A gene promoter. The DNA fragment contains a sequence of 234 nucleotides at its 3' end that corresponds to most of the untranslated region of the PDE5A1 mRNA. The remaining 3.5-kb upstream flanking sequence contains no apparent TATA box but has several sequences that resemble binding sequences for transcription factors such as androgen receptor (AR), AP1, AP2, AP4, Sp1, MyoD, Myc, and CArG. In search of promoter activities, we used a luciferase reporter system to examine 10 DNA fragments that cover various regions of the 3.7-kb fragment. We found that a full basal promoter activity was confined to a 139-bp region that includes 78 bp of the PDE5A1-specific first exon. A lesser basal promoter activity was still detectable in a 94-bp fragment that contains the same 78-bp PDE5A1-specific exon plus 16 bp of upstream sequence. Either the 139-bp or the 94-bp promoter fragment responded minimally to cAMP or cGMP (2 mM) stimulation. Longer fragments that contain either a 308-bp 5' extension (from the 138-bp fragment) or a 156-bp 3' extension (all exon sequence) responded at higher levels to cAMP and cGMP stimulation. The 5' and 3' extensions cooperated with each other to provide the highest level of responses to cAMP and cGMP stimulation. DNase I footprint analysis identified four AP2- and two Sp1-binding sites in the 5' extension and four Sp1-binding sites in the 3' extensions. Cyclic AMP and cGMP had similar stimulatory effects on the PDE5A promoter.
PDE5A gene encodes type 5 phosphodiesterase (PDE5), the principal cGMP-catalyzing enzyme in the penis and the primary target of sildenafil (Viagra). We have previously reported the isolation of three alternatively spliced PDE5A isoforms in humans. We also reported the identification of three corresponding alternative first exons and an intronic promoter in the human PDE5A gene. The intronic promoter is situated upstream from the PDE5A2-specific first exon but downstream from the PDE5A1- and A3-specific first exons. In the current study we showed that the intronic promoter could be upregulated by either cAMP or cGMP. In order to identify possible regulatory elements in the promoter, we created deletion and base-substitution mutants targeting one AP2- and four Sp1-binding sequences. Loss of function of these mutants to bind to the respective transcription factors was verified by DNase I footprint analysis, and changes in promoter function were analyzed with a luciferase reporter system. Mutation of the AP2-binding sequence and deletion of the 3'-most Sp1-binding site (within the exon) had little effects on the basal or the cyclic nucleotide-inducible promoter functions. Mutation of the 5'-most Sp1-binding site had much more severe effects on the basal and the cyclic nucleotide-inducible promoter functions. Mutation of a neighboring site that contains two overlapping Sp1-binding sequences completely nullified the basal and cyclic nucleotide-inducible promoter activities. Thus, the PDE5A2 intronic promoter depends on the overlapping Sp1-binding site for basal and cyclic nucleotide-inducible functions.
UGT2B7 catalyses the glucuronidation of a diverse range of drugs, environmental chemicals and endogenous compounds. Hence, coding region polymorphisms of UGT2B7 are potentially of pharmacological, toxicological and physiological significance. Two variant UGT2B7 cDNAs encoding enzymes with either His or Tyr at residue 268 have been isolated. The variants, referred to as UGT2B7*1 and UGT2B7*2, respectively, arise from a C to T transversion at nucleotide 802 of the UGT2B7 coding region. Analysis of genomic DNA from 91 unrelated Caucasians and 84 unrelated Japanese demonstrated the presence of the variant alleles encoding UGT2B7*1 and UGT2B7*2 in both populations. However, while there was an approximately equal distribution of subjects homozygous for each allele in the Caucasian population, subjects homozygous for the UGT2B7*1 allele were over 10-fold more prevalent than UGT2B7*2 homozygotes in Japanese. The frequencies of the UGT2B7*1 and UGT2B7*2 alleles were 0.511 and 0.489, respectively, in Caucasians, and 0.732 and 0.268, respectively, in Japanese. The 95% confidence intervals for the two alleles did not overlap between Caucasians and Japanese. Rates of microsomal androsterone, menthol and morphine (3-position) glucuronidation were determined for genotyped livers from Caucasian donors. Statistically significant inter-genotypic differences were not apparent for any of the three substrates. Although the UGT2B7 polymorphism characterized here is probably not associated with altered enzyme activity, the results highlight the need to consider ethnic variability in assessing the consequences of UGT polymorphisms.
CYP1A2 activity has been demonstrated to be bimodally or trimodally distributed in several populations, consistent with a codominant or recessive functional genetic polymorphism. However, studies aimed at identifying polymorphisms in CYPIA2 have not yet adequately accounted for this distribution pattern. To search for functional polymorphisms, we performed genome-walking, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing, and cloning, and identified three novel polymorphisms in the 5' flanking region of CYP1A2: a T-3591G substitution, a G-3595T substitution, and a T-3605 insertion. The frequency of the T-3591G substitution was determined by a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay, and found to be significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in Taiwanese (allele frequency 0.128, n = 125) compared to Caucasians (0.017, n = 87) or African Americans (0.024, n = 104). The functional consequence of the T-3591G and the G-3595T substitutions was determined by site-directed mutagenesis followed by transient transfection experiments. The T-3591G mutation was shown to be nonfunctional, while although the G-3595T mutation appeared to result in an increase in promoter activity, this was only to a small degree and therefore unlikely to be important in vivo. In addition, we report 532 bases of 5' flanking sequence further upstream than that reported to date, and four sequence discrepancies compared to the original published sequence (G-3649C, deltaT-3650, deltaA-4072, and C-4093 ins).
CD36 is a membrane glycoprotein expressed by several cell types, and play a role as a receptor for different physiological and pathological ligands. An immunodominant domain of CD36 has been described in the amino acidic region 155-183, where many ligands and monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) react. MoAbs against CD36 have proved useful in structural as well as functional studies. One of these antibodies, MoAb NL07, recognizes a conformational epitope that is acquired in the late steps of the CD36 maturation. The NL07 epitope appears to be functionally relevant and blocks CD36-mediated binding to red blood cells infected with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (IRBC). In this work a mutant COS-7 clone expressing NL07-negative CD36 molecules on the cell surface was investigated. In the mutant, the methionine in position 156 of the wild type CD36 sequence was replaced by a valine. It was determined that methionine 156 was essential for NL07 reactivity, mapping the NL07 epitope to the vicinity of the functionally important immunodominant domain (aa 155-183) of CD36. Although methionine 156 is located in this region, the CD36V156 mutated molecule was apparently functional and able to bind IRBC and oxidized LDL.
ADA deficiency is the first disease being treated by gene therapy. Since the first trial of gene therapy performed ten years ago, more than 10 patients including our case with ADA deficiency have been treated by the gene therapy with different clinical protocols. In contrast to the recent successful report for X-SCID patients, however, no curative effect of gene therapy for ADA deficiency has been achieved at the moment. In this chapter, I would like to review the past, the present and the future of gene therapy for ADA deficiency, and discuss an issue, especially PEG-ADA therapy, regarding the prospect for stem cell gene therapy for the disease.
PTEN is a novel tumour suppressor which exhibits tyrosine phosphatase activity as well as homology to the cytoskeletal proteins tensin and auxilin. Mutations of PTEN have been described in several human cancers and associated their invasiveness and metastatic properties. Although not malignant, rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RA-SF) exhibit certain tumour-like features such as attachment to cartilage and invasive growth. In the present study, we analyzed whether mutant transcripts of PTEN were present in RA-SF. In addition, we used in situ hybridization to study the expression of PTEN messenger (m)RNA in tissue samples of RA and normal individuals as well as in cultured RA-SF and in the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model of RA. Synovial tissue specimens were obtained from seven patients with RA and from two nonarthritic individuals. Total RNA was isolated from synovial fibroblasts and after first strand complementary (c)DNA synthesis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify a 1063 base pair PTEN fragment that encompassed the coding sequence of PTEN including the phosphatase domain and all mutation sites described so far. The PCR products were subcloned in Escherichia coli, and up to four clones were picked from each plate for automated sequencing. For in situ hybridization, digoxigenin-labelled PTEN-specific RNA probes were generated by in vitro transcription. For control in situ hybridization, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2-specific probe was prepared. To investigate the expression of PTEN in the absence of human macrophage or lymphocyte derived factors, we implanted RA-SF from three patients together with normal human cartilage under the renal capsule of SCID mice. After 60 days, mice were sacrificed, the implants removed and embedded into paraffin.
CA1 neurons in the hippocampus, a brain structure involved in learning and memory, are selectively vulnerable to ischemic effects. In this study, the authors examined if duration of ischemia is directly related to extent of CA1 damage and degree of spatial learning deficit. Adult female Wistar rats received either 5-min or 10-min ischemia or sham surgery. Following recovery, rats were tested in the Morris water maze. Histological analysis showed moderate cell loss in CA1 (31%) and CA3 (12%) and minimal cell loss in CA2 (4%) with 5-min ischemia. Increased cell loss was seen in CA1 (68%), CA2 (16%), and CA3 (23%) with 10-min ischemia. Behavioral testing revealed that animals with 10-min ischemia have greater spatial learning deficits and they remain impaired across the test days compared to the 5-min ischemic group. Furthermore, degree of CA1 cell loss accounted for approximately 45% of the variance in spatial learning deficits in the ischemic group. The authors conclude that cell loss is largely confined to CA1 region in rats who received 5 and 10 min of ischemia and that increased ischemic duration results in persistent learning deficits in female rats; also, the degree of behavioral impairment is related to extent of CA1 cell loss.
CYP2A6 is known as a major cytochrome P450 (CYP) responsible for the oxidation of nicotine and coumarin in humans. In this study, we explored genetic polymorphisms, which reduce CYP2A6 activity in Japanese. Two novel mutations in exon 9 of the CYP2A6 gene were found. A single nucleotide polymorphism of T1412C and G1454T resulted in Ile471Thr and Arg485Leu substitution, respectively. The frequency of the former variant allele was considerably high (15.7%), while the latter variant appeared to be a rare polymorphism. Heterologous expression of CYP2A6 using a cDNA possessing C instead of T-base at codon 471 in Escherichia coli caused remarkable reduction of the stability of holoenzyme at 37 degrees C. Furthermore, this variant enzyme almost lacked nicotine C-oxidase activity, although coumarin 7-hydroxylase activity was still observed. These data suggest that individuals homozygous for the T1412C variant allele or heterozygous for this and a defect allele such as the CYP2A6*4 may be poor metabolizer of nicotine, but not coumarin.
CYP2E1 expression was examined within, among, and in F(1) and backcross progeny of strains (P. monacha S68-5; P. viriosa M65-23) of the viviparous fish Poeciliopsis. CYP 2E1 activity varied dramatically in P. monacha, and P. viriosa (3.9+/-0.8 and 9.6+/-1.3 microg/min/mg) as well as the temperature which gave maximal activity (T(0)=25 degrees C and 31 degrees C). F(1) individuals from a crosses between P. monacha and P. viriosa, produced progeny whose CYP2E1 activity segregated into three different groups: (1) phenotypically the same as P. viriosa; (2) intermediate between the two parental strains; and (3) phenotypically the same as P. monacha. When a male P. monacha was crossed with a female P. viriosa 25% of the offspring had an intermediate phenotype and 65% the maternal P. viriosa phenotype. From the same cross, 85% of the females progeny had the maternal phenotype, while 80% of male progeny had the intermediate and paternal phenotype, suggesting an effect of the maternal genome on the F(1) phenotype. Among F(1) fish the T(0) was evenly distributed between parental values. In the backcross of a F(1) female to a male P. viriosa, CZX-6-hydroxylase activity segregated into the same three phenotypes with 60% of the progeny expressing the P. monacha phenotype. From the same cross, 70% of females and 40% of males expressed the P. monacha phenotype. The T(0) in the backcross were evenly distributed between the two parental values and the sex ratio among progeny was different than expected.
PTEN is a putative tumour suppressor gene located on chromosome band 10q23. Mutations in PTEN have been identified in numerous human malignancies, including cancers of the brain, endometrium, ovary, and prostate. In this study, we screened 80 Barrett's oesophagus-associated adenocarcinomas (BOAd) for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 10q23, using the microsatellite markers D10S541, D10S219, and D10S551. Tumours demonstrating LOH were then screened for the presence or absence of PTEN mutations. LOH at one or more loci was identified in 17/80 (21%) cases. In none of these cases did we detect mutations in PTEN. The presence of LOH did not correlate with patient age, tumour stage, degree of differentiation, presence of perineural or vascular invasion, or overall survival. We conclude that LOH at chromosome 10q23 is uncommon in BOAd, is not associated with mutations in the PTEN tumour suppressor gene, and does not correlate with the clinical or pathologic features of these tumours. It is possible that PTEN is inactivated through other mechanisms in BOAd.
CYP2D6 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of venlafaxine. Subjects with a low CYP2D6 activity have increased plasma concentrations of venlafaxine that may predispose them to cardiovascular side effects. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that diphenhydramine, a nonprescription antihistamine, can inhibit CYP2D6 activity. Therefore, the authors investigated in this study a potential drug interaction between diphenhydramine and venlafaxine. Fifteen male volunteers, nine with the extensive metabolizer (EM) and six with the poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype of CYP2D6, received venlafaxine hydrochloride 18.75 mg orally every 12 hours for 48 hours on two occasions (1 week apart): once alone and once during the concomitant administration of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (50 mg every 12 hours). Blood and urine samples were collected for 12 hours under steady-state conditions. In EMs, diphenhydramine decreased venlafaxine oral clearance from 104+/-60 L/hr to 43+/-23 L/hr (mean +/- SD; p < 0.05) without any effect on renal clearance (4+/-1 L/hr during venlafaxine alone and 4+/-2 L/hr during venlafaxine plus diphenhydramine). In PMs, coadministration of diphenhydramine did not cause significant changes in oral clearance and partial metabolic clearances of venlafaxine to its various metabolites. Diphenhydramine disposition was only slightly affected by genetically determined low CYP2D6 activity or concomitant administration of venlafaxine. In conclusion, diphenhydramine, at therapeutic doses, inhibits CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of venlafaxine in humans. Clinically significant interactions could be encountered during the concomitant administration of diphenhydramine and other antidepressant or antipsychotic drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6.
CD38 is a bifunctional ectoenzyme synthesizing from NAD(+) (ADP-ribosyl cyclase) and degrading (hydrolase) cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a powerful universal calcium mobilizer from intracellular stores. Recently, hexameric connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannels have been shown to release cytosolic NAD(+) from isolated murine fibroblasts (Bruzzone, S., Guida, L., Zocchi, E., Franco, L. and De Flora, A. (2001) FASEB J. 15, 10-12), making this dinucleotide available to the ectocellular active site of CD38. Here we investigated transwell co-cultures of CD38(+) (transfected) and CD38(-) 3T3 cells in order to establish the role of extracellular NAD(+) and cADPR on [Ca(2+)](i) levels and on proliferation of the CD38(-) target cells. CD38(+), but not CD38(-), feeder cells induced a [Ca(2+)](i) increase in the CD38(-) target cells which was comparable to that observed with extracellular cADPR alone and inhibitable by NAD(+)-glycohydrolase or by the cADPR antagonist 8-NH(2)-cADPR. Addition of recombinant ADP-ribosyl cyclase to the medium of CD38(-) feeders induced sustained [Ca(2+)](i) increases in CD38(-) target cells. Co-culture on CD38(+) feeders enhanced the proliferation of CD38(-) target cells over control values and significantly shortened the S phase of cell cycle. These results demonstrate a paracrine process based on Cx43-mediated release of NAD(+), its CD38-catalyzed conversion to extracellular cADPR, and influx of this nucleotide into responsive cells to increase [Ca(2+)](i) and stimulate cell proliferation.
CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme involved in metabolizing two Ca(2+) messengers, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). When incubated with NAD, CD38 predominantly hydrolyzes it to ADP-ribose (NAD glycohydrolase), but a trace amount of cADPR is also produced through cyclization of the substrate. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the amino acid important for controlling the hydrolysis and cyclization reactions. CD38 and its mutants were produced in yeast, purified, and characterized by immunoblot. Glu-146 is a conserved residue present in the active site of CD38. Its replacement with Phe greatly enhanced the cyclization activity to a level similar to that of the NAD hydrolysis activity. A series of additional replacements was made at the Glu-146 position including Ala, Asn, Gly, Asp, and Leu. All the mutants exhibited enhanced cyclase activity to various degrees, whereas the hydrolysis activity was inhibited greatly. E146A showed the highest cyclase activity, which was more than 3-fold higher than its hydrolysis activity. All mutants also cyclized nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide to produce cyclic GDP. This activity was enhanced likewise, with E146A showing more than 9-fold higher activity than the wild type. In addition to NAD, CD38 also hydrolyzed cADPR effectively, and this activity was correspondingly depressed in the mutants. When all the mutants were considered, the two cyclase activities and the two hydrolase activities were correlated linearly. The Glu-146 replacements, however, only minimally affected the base-exchange activity that is responsible for synthesizing NAADP. Homology modeling was used to assess possible structural changes at the active site of E146A. These results are consistent with Glu-146 being crucial in controlling specifically and selectively the cyclase and hydrolase activities of CD38.
UCP3 is a mitochondrial membrane protein expressed in humans selectively in skeletal muscle. To determine the mechanisms by which UCP3 plays a role in regulating glucose metabolism, we expressed human UCP3 in L6 myotubes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and in H(9)C(2) cardiomyoblasts by stable transfection with a tetracycline-repressible UCP3 construct. Expression of UCP3 in L6 myotubes increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake 2-fold and cell surface GLUT4 2.3-fold, thereby reaching maximally insulin-stimulated levels in control myotubes. Wortmannin, LY 294002, or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein abolished the effect of UCP3 on glucose uptake, and wortmannin inhibited UCP3-induced GLUT4 cell surface recruitment. UCP3 overexpression increased phosphotyrosine-associated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity 2.2-fold compared with control cells (p < 0.05). UCP3 overexpression increased lactate release 1.5- to 2-fold above control cells, indicating increased glucose metabolism. In H(9)C(2) cardiomyoblasts stably transfected with UCP3 under control of a tetracycline-repressible promotor, removal of doxycycline resulted in detectable levels of UCP3 at 12 h and 2.2-fold induction at 7 days compared with 12 h. In parallel, glucose transport increased 1.3- and 2-fold at 12 h and 7 days, respectively, and the stimulation was inhibited by wortmannin or genistein. p85 association with membranes was increased 5.5-fold and phosphotyrosine-associated PI3K activity 3.8-fold. In contrast, overexpression of UCP3 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes did not alter glucose uptake, suggesting tissue-specific effects of human UCP3. Thus, UCP3 stimulates glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells by activating a PI3K dependent pathway.
NDUFA1 is one of the 36 nuclear genes encoding subunits of the mitochondrial complex I involved in the respiratory chain. The human NDUFA1 has been cloned, completely sequenced and mapped to Xq24. In the present study, we searched for sequence variations in NDUFA1 as causative defects in complex I deficiency using genomic DNA of 152 patients with various clinical phenotypes. The patient sample consisted of 54 patients (46 male and 8 female) with Leber heriditary optic neuropathy (LHON) from 48 unrelated families from Germany and 98 patients (72 male and 26 female) with biochemically proven complex I deficiency including Leigh syndrome. Patient DNA was used to amplify all three exons, including the exon/intron boundaries and the promoter region of NDUFA1 for heteroduplex analysis and direct sequencing. In the 152 patients tested, no mutation was found that could be related to any of the disease phenotypes included. However, three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the promoter region (SNP G/C at nt -71 and SNP T/C at nt -189) and in intron 1 (SNP T/G nt 1454) were discovered. Allele frequencies of the SNPs were estimated in a German and Estonian control population and compared to complex I-deficient patients. There was no significant difference between the control population, the LHON patients, or the severely affected patients with complex I deficiency, excluding an association of the polymorphisms with the diseases. Our results suggest that mutations in NDUFA1 do not cause the gender difference observed in clinically severe and complex phenotypes with complex I deficiency.
ALDH3A1 catalyzes the detoxification of cyclophosphamide, mafosfamide, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide and other oxazaphosphorines. Constitutive ALDH3A1 levels, as well as those of certain other drug-metabolizing enzymes, e.g. NQO1 and CYP1A1, are relatively low in cultured, relatively oxazaphosphorine-sensitive, human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells. However, transient cellular insensitivity to the oxazaphosphorines can be brought about in these cells by transiently elevating ALDH3A1 levels in them as a consequence of transient exposure to: (1) electrophiles such as catechol that induce the transcription of a battery of genes, e.g. ALDH3A1 and NQO1, having in common an electrophile responsive element (EpRE) in their 5'-upstream regions; or (2) Ah-receptor agonists, e.g. indole-3-carbinol and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as 3-methylcholanthrene, that induce the transcription of a battery of genes, e.g. ALDH3A1, NQO1 and CYP1A1, having in common a xenobiotic responsive element (XRE) in their 5'-upstream regions. Further, MCF-7 sublines that are constitutively, i.e. when grown in the absence of the original selecting pressure, relatively oxazaphosphorine-insensitive as a consequence of constitutively relatively elevated cellular ALDH3A1 levels evolved when MCF-7 cells were: (1) continuously exposed for several months to gradually increasing concentrations of 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide or benz(a)pyrene; or (2) briefly exposed (once for 30 min) to a high concentration (1 mM) of mafosfamide. Each of these three stable sublines is constitutively relatively cross-insensitive to benz(a)pyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Cellular levels of NQO1, but not of CYP1A1, are also constitutively relatively elevated in each of the three sublines. RT-PCR-based experiments established that ALDH3A1 mRNA levels are constitutively elevated ( approximately 5- to 8-fold) in each of the three sublines. The elevated ALDH3A1 mRNA levels are not the consequence of gene amplification, hypomethylation of a relevant regulatory element, or ALDH3A1 mRNA stabilization. Collectively, these observations suggest that constitutively elevated levels of ALDH3A1 and certain other enzymes in the three stable sublines are probably the consequence of a constitutive change in the cellular concentration of a key component of the EpRE signaling pathway, such that the cellular concentration of the relevant ultimate transactivating factor is constitutively elevated, i.e. gene transcription promoted by transactivated EpREs is constitutively upregulated. Further, constitutively upregulated gene transcription mediated by transactivated EpREs can be relatively easily induced, whereas that mediated by transactivated XREs cannot, at least in MCF-7 cells. Still further, the three sublines may facilitate study of the signaling pathway that leads to transactivation of the EpREs present in the 5'-upstream regions of ALDH3A1, NQO1 and other gene loci.
CS mice show a free-running period (tau) longer than 24 h and rhythm splitting in constant darkness (DD). These features in behavioral circadian rhythms are distinctive as compared with other inbred strains of mice, which exhibit robust free-running rhythms with T shorter than 24 h. To identify the genes affecting tau, quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was initially conducted by using 289 F2 mice derived from a cross between CS and C57BL/6J strain. A suggestive QTL (LOD = 3.71) with CS allele increasing tau was detected on the distal region of Chromosome (Chr) 19. Next, using 192 F2 mice from a cross between CS and MSM strain, the presence of the QTL on Chr 19 was examined, and we confirmed the QTL at the genome-wide significant level (LOD = 4.61 with 10.4% of the total variance explained). This QTL was named long free-running period (Lfp). Three other suggestive QTLs (LOD = 3.24-4.28) were mapped to the midportion of Chr 12 in (CSxC57BL/6J)F2 mice, and to the proximal and middle region of Chr 19 in (CSxMSM)F2 mice, respectively, of which, CS alleles for two QTLs on Chr 19 have the effect of lengthening tau. None of these QTLs were mapped to the chromosomal regions of previously described QTLs for tau and known clock genes (Clock, mPer1, Bmal1, mCrv1, mCry2, mTim, and Csnk1e).
CD36 is an 88-kDa glycoprotein expressed on platelets and monocyte/macrophages (Mphi). CD36 is a multifunctional receptor for collagen, thrombospondin, oxidized low density lipoproteins (LDL), and long-chain fatty acids. The present study was performed to investigate whether CD36 can function as an adhesion molecule which is involved in mediating human macrophages (Mphi) adhesion to type I collagen in vitro. The Mphi of human CD36-deficient as well as normal control subjects were isolated and cultured on the multi-well plates coated with type I collagen, a natural ligand for CD36. Up to 2 h of incubation, the Mphi from CD36-deficient patients showed almost a approximately 55% decrease in adhesion to type I collagen in comparison to those from controls (P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the adhesion thereafter. Furthermore, the addition of antibody against CD36 into the media of control Mphi significantly inhibited the adhesion by approximately 50% (P < 0.05). The addition of oxidized LDL (OxLDL) did not alter adhesion of Mphi from both CD36-deficient and controls. These data suggest that CD36 is involved in the adhesion of Mphi to type I collagen, especially in the early stage of adhesion.
CYP1A1 is largely implicated in carcinogenesis. To date, it is known that this gene is induced by xenobiotics such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In this study, we evaluated the effect of serum in the regulation of CYP1A1 gene expression. CYP1A1 mRNA level is induced 1) in HepG2 and HT29-D4 cells by 3-methylcholanthrene 2) only in HepG2 after treatment by serum. The CYP1A1 mRNA induction in HepG2 is the consequence at least in part of a transcriptional activation as was demonstrated by evaluation of the hnRNA level. HepG2 cells were transfected by a plasmid containing the 7.5 Kb of the CYP1A1 promoter and the CAT reporter gene. No CAT stimulation was observed after serum treatment. These results demonstrated that CYP1A1 is induced at a transcriptional level by a physiological compound contained in serum independently of the Ah receptor and the 7.5 Kb promoter region.
CYP2C19 is selective for the 4'-hydroxylation of S-mephenytoin while the highly similar CYP2C9 has little activity toward this substrate. To identify critical amino acids determining the specificity of human CYP2C19 for S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation, we constructed chimeras by replacing portions of CYP2C9 containing various proposed substrate recognition sites (SRSs) with those of CYP2C19 and mutating individual residues by site-directed mutagenesis. Only a chimera containing regions encompassing SRSs 1--4 was active (30% of wild-type CYP2C19), indicating that multiple regions are necessary to confer specificity for S-mephenytoin. Mutagenesis studies identified six residues in three topological components of the proteins required to convert CYP2C9 to an S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylase (6% of the activity of wild-type CYP2C19). Of these, only the I99H difference located in SRS 1 between helices B and C reflects a change in a side chain that is predicted to be in the substrate-binding cavity formed above the heme prosthetic group. Two additional substitutions, S220P and P221T residing between helices F and G but not in close proximity to the substrate binding site together with five differences in the N-terminal portion of helix I conferred S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation activity with a K(M) similar to that of CYP2C19 but a 3-fold lower K(cat). Three residues in helix I, S286N, V292A, and F295L, were essential for S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation activity. On the basis of the structure of the closely related enzyme CYP2C5, these residues are unlikely to directly contact the substrate during catalysis but are positioned to influence the packing of substrate binding site residues and likely substrate access channels in the enzyme.
CD38 is involved in transmembrane signaling in many cell types; anti-CD38 autoantibodies have been described in diabetic patients. We tested whether human anti-CD38 antibodies possess signaling properties by measuring their ability to raise intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) using the fluo-3-acetoxymethyl ester method in a human-derived T-cell line (Jurkat T-cells, expressing high levels of surface CD38) and in dispersed human islet cells from normal donors. In Jurkat T-cells, 11 of 19 anti-CD38-positive sera raised [Ca2+]i (by > or =20% of baseline), whereas no [Ca2+]i-mobilizing activity was found in 27 anti-CD38-negative sera (chi2 = 20.5, P < 0.0001). In dispersed human islet cells, 5 of 11 anti-CD38-positive sera (and none of three anti-CD38-negative sera) raised [Ca2+]i significantly. When preincubated with Staphylococcus aureus protein A to remove IgG, anti-CD38-positive sera showed a 70 +/- 5% reduction in [Ca2+]i-mobilizing activity. Preincubation with CD38-transfected NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, but not with mock-transfected NIH-3T3 cells, abolished [Ca2+]i mobilization. In blocking experiments, preincubation with nonagonistic anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies also prevented [Ca2+]i mobilization. In cultured human islets, anti-CD38-positive sera exhibiting [Ca2+]i-mobilizing activity in Jurkat T-cells (n = 6) significantly stimulated insulin release at 3.3 mmol/l glucose (median [interquartile range] 738 microU/ml [234], P = 0.0001 vs. 320 [52] microU/ml of control), whereas 6 anti-CD38-positive sera without [Ca2+]i-mobilizing activity and 10 anti-CD38-negative did not. In further incubations, the five anti-CD38-positive sera displaying [Ca2+]i-mobilizing activity in dispersed islet cells significantly stimulated insulin release at both 3.3 mmol/l glucose (2.2 +/- 0.3% of insulin islet content, P < 0.002 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.1% of control) and 16.7 mmol/l glucose (3.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.3%, P < 0.002). We conclude that human anti-CD38 autoantibodies with agonistic properties on the CD38 effector system occur in nature; in human islets, their [Ca2+]i-mobilizing activity is coupled with the ability to stimulate insulin release.
MGEA5 was originally identified to be a novel human hyaluronidase, which is immunogenic in meningioma patients. Recently an N-acetylglucosaminidase was reported with identical sequence. Here, we define the origin of a splice variant by determining the genomic organization of the mgea5 gene. We find the splice variant missing a putative acetyltransferase domain of MGEA5. As for evolutionary analysis, we show that the MGEA5 is highly conserved in higher eukaryotes. As for expression analysis, we find both mRNA variants ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues and throughout mouse development. We generated polyclonal antibodies against MGEA5s/5 and identified proteins of 75 and 130 kDa, indicating posttranslational modifications of the larger protein. Cell fractionation revealed the cytoplasmic/cytoskeletal localization of the 130-kDa protein and the nuclear localization of the 75-kDa protein. We propose a model in which MGEA5 functions both as a hyaluronidase and an N-acetylglucosaminidase.
CYP2A6 is the principle enzyme metabolizing nicotine to its inactive metabolite cotinine. In this study, the selective probe reactions for each major cytochrome P450 (P450) were used to evaluate the specificity and selectivity of the CYP2A6 inhibitors methoxsalen, tranylcypromine, and tryptamine in cDNA-expressing and human liver microsomes. Phenacetin O-deethylation (CYP1A2), coumarin 7-hydroxylation (CYP2A6), diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C9), omeprazole 5-hydroxylation (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan O-demethylation (CYP2D6), 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin deethylation (CYP2B6), p-nitrophenol hydroxylation (CYP2E1), and omeprazole sulfonation (CYP3A4) were used as index reactions. Apparent K(i) values for inhibition of P450s' (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) activities showed that tranylcypromine, methoxsalen, and tryptamine have high specificity and relative selectivity for CYP2A6. In cDNA-expressing microsomes, tranylcypromine inhibited CYP2A6 (K(i) = 0.08 microM) with about 60- to 5000-fold greater potency relative to other P450s. Methoxsalen inhibited CYP2A6 (K(i) = 0.8 microM) with about 3.5- 94-fold greater potency than other P450s, except for CYP1A2 (K(i) = 0.2 microM). Tryptamine inhibited CYP2A6 (K(i) = 1.7 microM) with about 6.5- 213-fold greater potency relative to other P450s, except for CYP1A2 (K(i) = 1.7 microM). Similar results were also obtained with methoxsalen and tranylcypromine in human liver microsomes. R-(+)-Tranylcypromine, (+/-)-tranylcypromine, and S-(-)-tranylcypromine competitively inhibited CYP2A6-mediated metabolism of nicotine with apparent K(i) values of 0.05, 0.08, and 2.0 microM, respectively. Tranylcypromine [particularly R-(+) isomer], tryptamine, and methoxsalen are specific and relatively selective for CYP2A6 and may be useful in vivo to decrease smoking by inhibiting nicotine metabolism with a low risk of metabolic drug interactions.
ABCA1 has been suggested to play a key role in cellular lipid release from peripheral cells. In order to study structure-function relationship of this protein, the protein product of a full-length human ABCA1 cDNA was examined for its functions and topological orientation. The electrophoretic mobilities of human ABCA1 expressed in transfected cells increased when treated with N-glycosidase F, suggesting that ABCA1 is highly glycosylated. The ABCA1 was photoaffinity-labeled with ATP and mediated the apoA-I-dependent-release of cholesterol and phospholipid. The influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was introduced into the amino-terminus (N-HA) or between the residues 207 and 208 (207-HA) of the protein. While an antibody against the C-terminus peptide of ABCA1 detected both fusion proteins, an anti-HA antibody did not react with the N-HA fusion protein. Confocal microscopy demonstrated strong cell surface signal with the anti-HA antibody of nonpermeabilized HEK293 cells expressing the 207-HA fusion protein. The results suggested that the signal peptide in the amino-terminal region is cleaved off in its mature form and that the following large hydrophilic region is exposed to outside of cells unlike previously proposed models. We found that this amino-terminal extracellular domain contains a segment homologous to the autoantigen SS-N, an epitope of Sjögren's syndrome, and further identified that ABCA7 codes for the autoantigen SS-N.
CA1 pyramidal cells were recorded in rat hippocampal slices. In the presence of carbonic anhydrase activators, comicrostimulation of cholinergic inputs from stratum oriens and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inputs from stratum pyramidale at low intensities switched the hyperpolarizing GABA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials to depolarizing responses. In the absence of the activators, however, the same stimuli were insufficient to trigger the synaptic switch. This synaptic switch changed the function of the GABAergic synapses from excitation filter to amplifier and was prevented by carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, indicating a dependence on HCO. Intralateral ventricular administration of these same carbonic anhydrase activators caused the rats to exhibit superior learning of the Morris water maze task, suggesting that the GABAergic synaptic switch is critical for gating the synaptic plasticity that underlies spatial memory formation. Increased carbonic anhydrase activity might, therefore, also enhance perception, processing, and storing of temporally associated relevant signals and represents an important therapeutic target in learning and memory pharmacology.
ACE inhibitors are extensively used in the treatment of hypertension mainly because of their efficiency in reducing blood pressure levels and decreasing vascular and cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, ACE inhibitors improve baroreceptor reflex control. Chronic inhibition of ACE produces (in addition to decreased angiotensin II levels) a severe increase in angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] levels in several species. We have previously shown that Ang-(1-7) produces a facilitation of the baroreflex control of heart rate. In this study, we evaluated the participation of endogenous Ang-(1-7) in the improvement of baroreflex sensitivity in spontaneously hypertensive rats after central infusion of ramiprilat, an ACE inhibitor. Reflex changes in heart rate were elicited, in conscious rats, by bolus injections of phenylephrine (baroreflex bradycardia) before and after intracerebroventricular infusion of (1) saline (8 microL/h), 4 hours (n=5); (2) ramiprilat (14 microg/h), 4 hours (n=6); (3) ramiprilat for 2 hours, followed by ramiprilat combined with A-779 (4 microg/h), a selective Ang-(1-7) antagonist, for an additional 2 hours (n=6); and (4) A-779 for 2 hours, followed by A-779 combined with ramiprilat for an additional 2 hours (n=5). Intracerebroventricular infusion of ramiprilat produced an important increase ( approximately 40%) in baroreflex sensitivity (evaluated as the ratio between changes in heart rate and changes in mean arterial pressure) that was completely reversed by A-779. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular infusion of A-779 prevented the improvement of the baroreflex sensitivity produced by ramiprilat. Intracerebroventricular infusion of saline or A-779 alone did not significantly alter the baroreflex sensitivity. These results suggest that endogenous Ang-(1-7) is involved in the improvement of baroreflex sensitivity observed in spontaneously hypertensive rats during central ACE inhibition.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor that antagonizes phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) by dephosphorylating the D3 position of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P3). Given the importance of PTEN in regulating PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 levels, we used Affymetrix GeneChip arrays to identify genes regulated by PTEN. PTEN expression rapidly reduced the activity of Akt, which was followed by a G(1) arrest and eventually apoptosis. The gene encoding insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2), a mediator of insulin signaling, was found to be the most induced gene at all time points. A PI3K-specific inhibitor, LY294002, also upregulated IRS-2, providing evidence that it was the suppression of the PI3K pathway that was responsible for the message upregulation. In addition, PTEN, LY294002, and rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, caused a reduction in the molecular weight of IRS-2 and an increase in the association of IRS-2 with PI3K. Apparently, PTEN inhibits a negative regulator of IRS-2 to upregulate the IRS-2-PI3K interaction. These studies suggest that PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 levels regulate the specific activity and amount of IRS-2 available for insulin signaling.
NPC1 is a member of a family of polytopic membrane-bound proteins with sterol-sensing domains. Inactivating mutations of NPC1 are responsible for most cases of Niemann-Pick type C disease, whose hallmark is progressive neurodegeneration. The precise molecular mechanisms whereby defective NPC1 function leads to neurodegeneration are unknown. In the brain, we have previously found NPC1 to localize predominantly within perisynaptic astrocytic processes. Here we have mapped the regional distribution of NPC1 in the monkey brain. Dense NPC1 immunoreactivity was observed in telencephalic structures, including the cerebral neocortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus and putamen, whilst light immunostaining was observed in diencephalic structures, including the globus pallidus, thalamus and hypothalamus. Light staining was also generally observed in the midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata and cerebellum, except the inferior olive, which was densely stained. By light microscopy, only a few indistinctly labeled cell bodies were observed even within densely labeled regions, where most of the immunoreactivity appeared to be due to the large numbers of labeled cellular processes. On electron microscopy, these processes were identified as glial, and not neuronal. The astrocytic localization of NPC1 was further confirmed by double labeling for NPC1 and GFAP. The regional pattern of NPC1 expression suggests that areas normally expressing low levels of the NPC1 protein are more susceptible to neuronal degeneration in Niemann-Pick type C disease.
NSF is a cytosolic ATPase implicated in a variety of cellular functions including synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Here we report a lethal mutation in the Drosophila homolog of NSF (dNSF1). Lethality staging and rescue experiments with the wild type dNSF1 transgene show that NSF1 is critically required during early larval stages and during late pupariation. Lethality in larval stages is associated with defects in neurogenesis as evidenced by an overall reduction in synapse size and synapse branching. Moreover, escaper adults, though showing abnormal seizure-like paralytic behavior, are normal in terms of synaptic transmission as assayed by electroretinograms. Taken together, these data indicate a role for NSF in neural growth and branching in addition to its documented role in synaptic transmission.
MIP family proteins can be divided into two groups according to their primary sequences. The CHIP group is predominant in the plant and animal kingdoms and functions primarily as water channels. The GLP group is a minor group with limited prevalence and functions primarily as glycerol transporters. Both prototypes are present in bacteria and may have evolved separately.
CFTR is a chloride channel whose gating process involves coordinated interactions among the regulatory (R) domain and the nucleotide-binding folds (NBFs). Protein kinase A phosphorylation of serine residues renders the R domain from inhibitory to stimulatory and enables ATP binding and hydrolysis at the NBFs, which in turn control opening and closing of the chloride channel.
CD36 and scavenger receptor class A types I and II (SR-AI/II) are major receptors for oxidized low density lipoproteins (OxLDL) expressed on macrophages. To elucidate the role of these two macrophage scavenger receptors in the development of coronary atherosclerosis, we examined the localization of CD36 and SR-AI/II in human coronary atherosclerotic lesions. Serial cryostat sections of 49 coronary arteries obtained from 43 autopsied cases were examined immunohistochemically. Regarding the relationship between the severity of atherosclerosis and immunoreactivities to CD36, there was almost no immunoreactivity to CD36 in regions with diffuse intimal thickening, while the expression of CD36 was accelerated in parallel with the progression of atherosclerosis. In contrast, SR-AI/II was expressed persistently from regions with diffuse intimal thickening to atherosclerotic plaques. We also clarified the differential distribution of CD36 and SR-AI/II in atheromatous plaques. Close to the luminal surface of the intima, macrophages were relatively small in size, contained lesser lipids, and expressed SR-AI/II more abundantly than CD36. In contrast, macrophages in the core region were larger in size, contained more lipids, were strongly positive for CD36 and showed a weaker immunoreactivity to SR-AI/II than those in the luminal surface of the intima. In conclusion, the expression of CD36 and SR-AI/II on macrophages may be regulated differently in the process of coronary atherogenesis.
PTEN (MMAC1/TEP1), a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome subband 10q23.3, is variably mutated and/or deleted in a variety of human cancers. Germline mutations in PTEN, which encode a dual-specificity phosphatase, have been implicated in at least two hamartoma tumor syndromes that exhibit some clinical overlap, Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. Among several series of ovarian cancers, the frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of markers flanking and within PTEN, is approximately 30 to 50%, and the somatic intragenic PTEN mutation frequency is <10%. In this study, we screened primary adenocarcinomas of the ovary for LOH of polymorphic markers within and flanking the PTEN gene and for intragenic mutations of the PTEN gene and compared them to PTEN expression using immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we sought to detect the expression of the presumed downstream targets of PTEN, such as P-Akt, p27, and cyclin D1 by immunohistochemistry. LOH at 10q23 was observed in 29 of 64 (45%) cases. Of the 117 samples, 6 somatic intragenic PTEN mutations, 1 germline mutation, and 1 novel polymorphism were found in 7 (6%) patients. Immunostaining of 49 ovarian cancer samples revealed that 13 (27%) were PTEN immunostain-negative, 25 (51%) had reduced staining, and the rest (22%) were PTEN expression-positive. Among the 44 informative tumors assessed for 10q23 LOH and PTEN immunostaining, there was an association between 10q23 LOH and decreased or absent staining (P = 0.0317). Of note, there were five (11%) tumors with neither mutation nor deletion that exhibited no PTEN expression and 10 (25%) others without mutation or deletion but had decreased PTEN expression. Among the 49 tumors available for immunohistochemistry, 28 (57%) showed P-Akt-positive staining, 24 (49%) had decreased p27 staining, and cyclin D1 was overexpressed in 35 (79%) cases. In general, P-Akt expression was inversely correlated with PTEN expression (P = 0.0083). These data suggest that disruption of PTEN by several mechanisms, allelic loss, intragenic mutation, or epigenetic silencing, all contribute to epithelial ovarian carcinogenesis, and that epigenetic silencing is a significant mechanism. The Akt pathway is prominently involved, but clearly not in all cases. Surprisingly, despite in vitro demonstration that p27 and cyclin D1 lies downstream of PTEN and Akt, there was no correlation between p27 and cyclin D1 expression and PTEN or P-Akt status. Thus, in vivo, although PTEN and Akt play a prominent role in ovarian carcinogenesis, p27 and cyclin D1 might not be the primary downstream targets. Alternatively, these observations could also suggest that pathways involving other than Akt, p27 and cyclin D1 that lie downstream of PTEN play roles in ovarian carcinogenesis.
ACE inhibitors improve endothelial dysfunction, possibly by blocking endothelial angiotensin production. Prorenin, through its binding and activation by endothelial mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) receptors, may contribute to this production. Here, we investigated this possibility as well as prorenin activation kinetics, the nature of the prorenin-activating enzyme, and M6P receptor-independent prorenin binding. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with wild-type prorenin, K/A-2 prorenin (in which Lys42 is mutated to Ala, thereby preventing cleavage by known proteases), M6P-free prorenin, and nonglycosylated prorenin, with or without M6P, protease inhibitors, or angiotensinogen. HUVECs bound only M6P-containing prorenin (K(d) 0.9+/-0.1 nmol/L, maximum number of binding sites [B(max)] 1010+/-50 receptors/cell). At 37 degrees C, because of M6P receptor recycling, the amount of prorenin internalized via M6P receptors was >25 times B(max). Inside the cells, wild-type and K/A-2 prorenin were proteolytically activated to renin. Renin was subsequently degraded. Protease inhibitors interfered with the latter but not with prorenin activation, thereby indicating that the activating enzyme is different from any of the known prorenin-activating enzymes. Incubation with angiotensinogen did not lead to endothelial angiotensin generation, inasmuch as HUVECs were unable to internalize angiotensinogen. Most likely, therefore, in the absence of angiotensinogen synthesis or endocytosis, M6P receptor-mediated prorenin internalization by endothelial cells represents prorenin clearance.
ACE inhibition (ACEI) attenuates post-myocardial infarction (MI) LV remodeling, but the effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)) antagonism alone or in combination with ACEI are unclear. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of AT(1) antagonism, ACEI, and their combination in a well-characterized ovine postinfarction model.
CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on the surface of leukemic cells in a significant percentage of patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). A recent study suggested that CD38 expression has prognostic value in CLL. Peripheral blood samples from 218 patients with B-CLL were analyzed by flow cytometry for CD38 expression on CD5/19(+) leukemic cells. Various patient characteristics were studied including age, sex, Rai and Binet stages, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, hemoglobin (Hgb) level, beta-2 microglobulin (beta2M) level in the serum, number of nodal sites involved with disease, and length of survival. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to construct survival curves, and the log-rank statistic was used to compare these curves. CD38 was expressed in 20% or more of leukemic cells in 43% of the patients. Patients with high CD38 expression (20% or more) had significantly shorter survival times (P =.00005). Multivariate analyses showed that CD38 expression is an important prognostic factor associated with high incidence of lymph node involvement (P =.004), lower hemoglobin level (P =.001), hepatomegaly (P =.05), and high beta2M level (P =.00005). CD38 expression identified a group of patients with aggressive disease that was considered by Rai staging to be early-stage disease (Rai stages 0-II). Patients with CD38(+) samples have significantly aggressive disease regardless of their clinical stage. Measurement of CD38 expression by flow cytometry should become a routine test in the evaluation of patients with CLL.
MTHFR encodes a critical enzyme in folate and homocysteine metabolism and the C677T allele of the MTHFR gene has some association with an increased risk for neural-tube defects and for adult cardiovascular diseases. As part of an international collaborative study the prevalence of C677T homozygous genotype was 11.1% while the frequency of C677T heterozygous condition was 45.2% in the Hungarian neonate sample. These findings underscore the clinical importance of the C677T variant in the Hungarian population and urge population-based prevention of conditions related to such gene.
CYP2A6 is a major catalyst of nicotine metabolism to cotinine. Previously, we demonstrated that the interindividual difference in nicotine metabolism is related to a genetic polymorphism of the CYP2A6 gene in Japanese. To clarify the ethnic differences in nicotine metabolism and frequencies of CYP2A6 alleles, we studied nicotine metabolism and the CYP2A6 genotype in 209 Koreans. The cotinine/nicotine ratio of the plasma concentration 2 h after chewing one piece of nicotine gum was calculated as an index of nicotine metabolism. The genotypes of CYP2A6 gene (CYP2A6*1A, CYP2A6*1B, CYP2A6*2, CYP2A6*3, CYP2A6*4 and CYP2A6*5) were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism or allele specific (AS)-PCR. There were ethnic differences in the allele frequencies of CYP2A6*1A, CYP2A6*1B, CYP2A6*4 and CYP2A6*5 between Koreans (45.7%, 42.8%, 11.0% and 0.5%, respectively) and Japanese (42.4%, 37.5%, 20.1% and 0%, respectively, our previous data). Similar to the Japanese, no CYP2A6*2 and CYP2A6*3 alleles were found in Koreans. The homozygotes of the CYP2A6*4 allele (four subjects) were completely deficient in cotinine formation, being consistent with the data among Japanese. The heterozygotes of CYP2A6*4 tended to possess a lower metabolic ratio (CYP2A6*1A/CYP2A6*4, 4.79 +/- 3.17; CYP2A6*1B/CYP2A6*4, 7.43 +/- 4.97) than that in subjects without the allele (CYP2A6*1A/CYP2A6*1A, 7.42 +/- 6.56; CYP2A6*1A/CYP2A6*1B, 9.85 +/- 16.12; CYP2A6*1B/CYP2A6*1B, 11.33 +/- 9.33). The subjects who possess the CYP2A6*1B allele appeared to show higher capabilities of cotinine formation. It was confirmed that the interindividual difference in nicotine metabolism was closely related to the genetic polymorphism of CYP2A6. The probit plot of the metabolic ratios in Koreans (8.73 +/- 11.88) was shifted to a higher ratio than that in the Japanese (3.78 +/- 3.09). In each genotype group, the Korean subjects revealed significantly higher metabolic ratios than the Japanese subjects. The ethnic difference in cotinine formation might be due to environmental and/or diet factors as well as genetic factors.
ABCG2 (also called MXR (3), BCRP (4), or ABCP (5) is a recently-identified ABC half-transporter, which causes multidrug resistance in cancer. Here we report that the expression of the ABCG2 protein in Sf9 insect cells resulted in a high-capacity, vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity in isolated membrane preparations. ABCG2 was expressed underglycosylated, and its ATPase activity was stimulated by daunorubicin, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, prazosin and rhodamine 123, compounds known to be transported by this protein. ABCG2-ATPase was inhibited by low concentrations of Na-orthovanadate, N-ethylmaleimide and cyclosporin A. Verapamil had no effect, while Fumitremorgin C, reversing ABCG2-dependent cancer drug resistance, strongly inhibited this ATPase activity. The functional expression of ABCG2 in this heterologous system indicates that no additional partner protein is required for the activity of this multidrug transporter, probably working as a homodimer. We suggest that the Sf9 cell membrane ATPase system is an efficient tool for examining the interactions of ABCG2 with pharmacological agents.
ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists increase the effective renal plasma flow dose dependently, whereas glomerular filtration rate does not change. Both substances reduce dose dependently arterial blood pressure, glomerular capillary pressure and proteinuria and are probably comparably renoprotective due to haemodynamic and non-haemodynamic (e.g. antiproliferative) effects. These data indicate that the renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists are the results of inhibition of angiotensin II and not due to inhibition of bradykinin degradation. Several studies suggest an additive renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. However, controlled clinical studies are lacking. Experimental data suggest that the combination of AT1 and AT2 receptor blockers or treatment with ACE inhibitors reduce more effectively inflammatory cell infiltration into the kidney than angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists alone. Long-term clinical trials using angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists are needed before these substances can be recommended as comparably renoprotective as ACE inhibitors.
CYP2J2 is abundant in human heart and its arachidonic acid metabolites, the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), have potent vasodilatory, antiinflammatory and cardioprotective properties. This study was designed to examine the role of CYP2J2 in hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced injury in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs). Early passage BAECs were exposed to 24-h hypoxia followed by 4-h reoxygenation (HR). HR resulted in cell injury, as indicated by significant increases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and trypan blue stained cells (p < 0.01) and was associated with a decrease in CYP2J2 protein expression. Transfection of BAECs with the CYP2J2 cDNA resulted in increased CYP2J2 expression and arachidonic acid epoxygenase activity, compared with cells transfected with an irrelevant green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA. HR induced significant injury in GFP-transfected BAECs, as indicated by increases in LDH release and trypan blue-stained cells (p < 0.01); however, the HR-induced injury was markedly attenuated in CYP2J2-transfected cells (p < 0.01). HR increased cellular 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha) (p < 0.05), and decreased eNOS expression, L-arginine uptake and conversion, and nitrite production (p < 0.01) in GFP-transfected BAECs. CYP2J2 transfection attenuated the HR-induced increase in 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha) (p < 0.05) and decreased the amount of extracellular superoxide detected by cytochrome c reduction under normoxic conditions (p < 0.05) but did not significantly affect HR-induced decreases in eNOS expression, L-arginine uptake and conversion, and nitrite production. Treatment of BAECs with synthetic EETs and/or epoxide hydrolase inhibitors also showed protective effects against HR injury (p < 0.05). These observations suggest: (1) HR results in endothelial injury and decreased CYP2J2 expression; (2) transfection with the CYP2J2 cDNA protects against HR injury; and (3) the cytoprotective effects of CYP2J2 may be mediated, at least in part, by antioxidant effects.
CYP2C9 is a polymorphic gene for which there are four known allelic variants; CYP2C9*1, CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and CYP2C9*4. In the present study, DNA from 140 European Americans and 120 African Americans was examined by single-strand conformational polymorphism and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses, resulting in the identification of a new CYP2C9 variant, CYP2C9*5. This variant is derived from a C1080G transversion in exon 7 of CYP2C9 that leads to an Asp360Glu substitution in the encoded protein. The CYP2C9*5 variant was found to be expressed only in African Americans, such that approximately 3% of this population carries the CYP2C9*5 allele. The variant was expressed in, and purified from, insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus. Comparative kinetic studies using the purified wild-type protein CYP2C9*1; the Ile359Leu variant, CYP2C9*3; and the Asp360Glu variant, CYP2C9*5 were carried out using (S)-warfarin, diclofenac, and lauric acid as substrates. The major effect of the Asp360Glu mutation was to increase the K(m) value relative to that of CYP2C9*1 for all three substrates: 12-fold higher for (S)-warfarin 7-hydroxylation, 5-fold higher for the 4'-hydroxylation of diclofenac, and 3-fold higher for the omega-1 hydroxylation of lauric acid. V(max) values differed less than K(m) values between the CYP2C9*1 and CYP2C9*5 proteins. In vitro intrinsic clearances for CYP2C9*5, calculated as the ratio of V(max)/K(m), ranged from 8 to 18% of CYP2C9*1 values. The corresponding ratio for CYP2C9*3 was 4 to 13%. Accordingly, the in vitro data suggest that carriers of the CYP2C9*5 allele would eliminate CYP2C9 substrates at slower rates relative to persons expressing the wild-type protein.
ACE inhibitors block B(2) receptor desensitization, thereby potentiating bradykinin beyond blocking its hydrolysis. Angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) also acts as an ACE inhibitor and, in addition, may stimulate bradykinin release via angiotensin II type 2 receptors. In this study we compared the bradykinin-potentiating effects of Ang-(1-7), quinaprilat, and captopril. Porcine coronary arteries, obtained from 32 pigs, were mounted in organ baths, preconstricted with prostaglandin F(2alpha), and exposed to quinaprilat, captopril, Ang-(1-7), and/or bradykinin. Bradykinin induced complete relaxation (pEC(50)=8.11+/-0.07, mean+/-SEM), whereas quinaprilat, captopril, and Ang-(1-7) alone were without effect. Quinaprilat shifted the bradykinin curve to the left in a biphasic manner: a 5-fold shift at concentrations that specifically block the C-domain (0.1 to 1 nmol/L) and a 10-fold shift at concentrations that block both domains. Captopril and Ang-(1-7) monophasically shifted the bradykinin curve to the left, by a factor of 10 and 5, respectively. A 5-fold shift was also observed when Ang-(1-7) was combined with 0.1 nmol/L quinaprilat. Repeated exposure of porcine coronary arteries to 0.1 micromol/L bradykinin induced B(2) receptor desensitization. The addition of 10 micromol/L quinaprilat or Ang-(1-7) to the bath, at a time when bradykinin alone was no longer able to induce relaxation, fully restored the relaxant effects of bradykinin. Angiotensin II type 1 or 2 receptor blockade did not affect any of the observed effects of Ang-(1-7). In conclusion, Ang-(1-7), like quinaprilat and captopril, potentiates bradykinin by acting as an ACE inhibitor. Bradykinin potentiation is maximal when both the ACE C- and N-terminal domains are inhibited. The inhibitory effects of Ang-(1-7) are limited to the ACE C-domain, raising the possibility that Ang-(1-7) synergistically increases the blood pressure-lowering effects of N-domain-specific ACE inhibitors.
PHEX is homologous to the M13 zinc metallopeptidases, a class of type II membrane glycoproteins. Although more than 140 mutations in the PHEX gene have been identified in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), the most prevalent form of inherited rickets, the molecular consequences of disease-causing PHEX mutations have not yet been investigated. We examined the effect of PHEX missense mutations on cellular trafficking of the recombinant protein. Four mutant PHEX cDNAs were generated by PCR mutagenesis: C85R, G579R and S711R, identified in XLH patients, and E581V, previously engineered in neutral endopeptidase 24.11, where it abolished catalytic activity but not plasma membrane targeting. Wild-type and mutant PHEX cDNAs were transfected in HEK(293) cells and PHEX protein expression was characterized. In contrast to the wild-type and E581V PHEX proteins, the C85R, G579R and S711R mutants were completely sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion, indicating that they were not fully glycosylated. Sequestration of the disease-causing mutant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane localization of wild-type and E581V PHEX proteins was demonstrated by immunofluorescence and cell surface biotinylation. Of the three mutant PHEX proteins, the S711R was the least stable and the only one that could be rescued from the ER to the plasma membrane in cells grown at 26 degrees C. The chemical chaperone glycerol failed to correct defective targeting of all three mutant proteins. Our data provide a mechanism for loss of PHEX function in XLH patients expressing the C85R, G579R and S711R mutations.
CYP2C9 enzyme activity is involved in the metabolism of substances related to colorectal cancer, and it is functionally linked to a genetic polymorphism. Two allelic variants of the CYP2C9 gene, namely CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, differ from wild-type CYP2C9*1 by single amino acid substitutions. These mutated alleles encode enzymes with altered properties that are associated with impaired metabolism. The present study evaluates the impact of CYP2C9 genotypes leading to high enzyme activity on colorectal cancer risk. For this, the frequency of allelic variants of the CYP2C9 gene was analysed in genomic DNA from 129 patients with colorectal cancer and in 150 healthy controls. Patients with colorectal cancer showed a statistically significant increase in the frequency of genotypes homozygous for the active CYP2C9*1 gene, as compared with healthy individuals. Such a high frequency is more significant among patients with cancer in proximal segments of the colon (P < 0.025; odds ratio 2.36 95% CI 1.18-4.72), and decreases in more distal tumour locations. We conclude that CYP2C9 polymorphism can be considered as a secondary risk factor for colorectal cancer in the studied population: those individuals with genotypes leading to high enzyme activity were at increased risk. The association of the CYP2C9 polymorphism to colorectal cancer risk could be related to CYP2C9-mediated metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic amines. In addition, the key role of CYP2C9 in the metabolic inactivation of non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs could diminish the protective effect of these drugs against colorectal cancer.
CD36 and scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) are both class B scavenger receptors that recognize a broad variety of ligands, including oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL), HDL, anionic phospholipids, and apoptotic cells. In this study we investigated the role of mouse CD36 (mCD36) as a physiological lipoprotein receptor. We compared the association of various lipoprotein particles with mCD36 and mSR-BI expressed in COS cells by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. mCD36 bound human oxLDL and mouse HDL with high affinity. Human LDL bound poorly to mCD36, indicating that mCD36 is unlikely to play a significant role in LDL metabolism. The ability of mCD36 to mediate the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters (CE) from receptor-bound HDL was assessed. In comparison with mSR-BI, mCD36 inefficiently mediated the selective uptake of CE. Hepatic overexpression of mCD36 in C57BL/6 mice by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer did not result in significant alterations in plasma LDL and HDL levels. We conclude that mCD36, while able to bind HDL with high affinity, does not contribute significantly to HDL or LDL metabolism.
PNP deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by severe combined immunodeficiency and by complex neurological symptomatology including ataxia, developmental delay and spasticity. Patients usually die in the first or second decade of life due to recurrent infections. The only curative treatment is bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We describe a 22-month-old girl who underwent BMT from her HLA-identical brother. Conditioning consisted of busulfan and fludarabine only, resulting in low toxicity and prompt engraftment. At 18 months after BMT, the girl has developed normal immunological functions, and her neurological status has improved.
SPR biosensor technology continues to evolve. The recently released platform from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden), BIACORE J, is designed for the routine analysis of biomolecular interactions. Using an antibody-protein A and a ligand-receptor system, we demonstrate the utility of BIACORE J in determining active concentration and binding affinities. The results from these studies illustrate the high sensitivity of the instrument and its ability to generate reproducible binding responses. The BIACORE J is easy to operate and useful in diverse applications, making SPR technology widely accessible as a research tool.
PC SPES (BotanicLab, Brea, California) an herbal supplement for patients with prostate cancer, is composed of 7 highly concentrated Chinese herbs and 1 US herb. It was developed in seeking positive attributes of Chinese and Western medicine for cancer treatment. Chemical standardization of this composition showed that baicalin is the most abundant active compound. Several reports on phase 2 clinical studies of PC SPES suggest that it is a well-tolerated active treatment for androgen-independent prostate cancer. In this report, data obtained from various laboratory experiments will be presented to elucidate the in vitro mechanism. Profound biologic effects of PC SPES on prostate cancer cells were observed on both androgen-dependent (LNCap) and androgen-independent (DU-145) cell lines. These effects include the following: (1) induction of cell apoptosis and cell cycle modulation; (2) inhibition of cell proliferation; (3) downregulation of bcl-2, bcl-6, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and prostate-specific antigen proteins; (4) downregulation of androgen receptor (AR); and (5) upregulation of p53, bax, and p21 proteins. Concurrent animal studies using 2 different models, Copenhagen rats and nude mice, confirmed a dose-dependent suppressive effect of PC SPES on tumor volumes and tumor progression. Our results show that the cytotoxic and cytostatic properties of PC SPES are not entirely dependent on the presence of AR. The antitumor mechanism of PC SPES is complex. It involves multiple metabolic pathways, such that the whole extract acts on redundant mechanisms, which otherwise will permit cell survival if a single-target agent is used.
PHEX is the gene defective in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. In this study, analysis of PHEX revealed mutations in 22 hypophosphatemic rickets patients, including 16 of 28 patients in whom all 22 PHEX exons were studied. In 13 patients, in whom no PHEX mutation had been previously detected in 17 exons, the remaining 5 PHEX exons were analyzed and mutations found in 6 patients. Twenty different mutations were identified, including 16 mutations predicted to truncate PHEX and 4 missense mutations. Phenotype analysis was performed on 31 hypophosphatemic rickets patients with PHEX mutations, including the 22 patients identified in this study, 9 patients previously identified, and affected family members. No correlation was found between the severity of disease and the type or location of the mutation. However, among patients with a family history of hypophosphatemic rickets, there was a trend toward more severe skeletal disease in patients with truncating mutations. Family members in more recent generations had a milder phenotype. Postpubertal males had a more severe dental phenotype. In conclusion, although identifying mutations in PHEX may have limited prognostic value, genetic testing may be useful for the early identification and treatment of affected individuals. Furthermore, this study suggests that other genes and environmental factors affect the severity of hypophosphatemic rickets.
PTEN phosphatase acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. It is unclear which downstream components of this pathway are necessary for oncogenic transformation. In this report we show that transformed cells of PTEN(+/-) mice have elevated levels of phosphorylated Akt and activated p70/S6 kinase associated with an increase in proliferation. Pharmacological inactivation of mTOR/RAFT/FRAP reduced neoplastic proliferation, tumor size, and p70/S6 kinase activity, but did not affect the status of Akt. These data suggest that p70/S6K and possibly other targets of mTOR contribute significantly to tumor development and that inhibition of these proteins may be therapeutic for cancer patients with deranged PI3K signaling.
CYP2D6 is involved in the metabolism of several classes of drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and various amphetamines. CYP2D6*10 is an allelic variant, producing an enzyme with Pro34Ser and Ser486Thr amino acid substitutions. Approximately 75% of Asians possess the *10 allele. We sought to further characterize CYP2D6.10 catalytically in vitro in a baculovirus expression system using various substrates and inhibitors, in comparison to CYP2D6.1 (wild-type). Using dextromethorphan (DEX), P-methoxyamphetamine, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and (+/-)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), the ratios of intrinsic clearance (Vmax/Km) of *1 to *10 were 50, 34, 22 and 123, respectively. The CYP2D6 substrates amitriptyline, and (+) and (-) methamphetamine (MAMP) are both p-hydroxylated and N-demethylated (NDM). The intrinsic clearance *1/*10 ratios were 42, 30 and 67 for the p-hydroxylation; and 60, 120 and 157 for the NDM, respectively, illustrating chemical pathway and enantiomeric selectivity for MAMP. It was apparent that (+) and (-) MAMP NDM and MDMA demethylenation were most significantly different in CYP2D6.10. Using DEX as the substrate, the ratios of Ki(*10)/Ki(*1) for inhibitors were: budipine (1.3), sparteine (1.6), debrisoquine (8.1), fluoxetine (16), norfluoxetine (30), paroxetine (14), MDMA (21) and MMDA-2 (7.1), indicating that CYP2D6.10 shows drug-specific altered susceptibility to inhibition. Taken together, these data suggest that CYP2D6*10/*10 individuals may be expected to require different drug doses; and show altered susceptibility to toxicity, interaction risk and, in the case of the amphetamines, drug dependence and toxicity compared to CYP2D6*1/*1 individuals.
PC SPES is a mixture of Chinese plants or plant extracts available on unrestricted sale since 1996 in the treatment of prostate cancer. Each of its components has been individually demonstrated to have an antitumour action anti-neoplastic in various in vitro or in vivo models. Its favourable action on hormone-resistant prostate cancer, demonstrated in studies with only a short follow-up, led to a certain publicity concerning this product, and its unrestricted sale together with the possibility of purchasing this product in other countries by Internet have led to the use of this product by some patients in France without medical advice or follow-up. This article presents a critical review of the results of this product in prostate cancer.
ACE and endothelial cell nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) genotypes have been reported to be related to the incidence of renal diseases and coronary artery diseases. In order to assess the effect of the gene polymorphism of both ACE and ecNOS on renal hemodynamic abnormality, we examined 155 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes with various stages of nephropathy.
ABO histo-blood group is a major determinant of plasma levels of factor VIII (FVIII) and von Willebrand factor (vWF). Blood group O individuals have significantly (approximately 25%) lower plasma levels of both glycoproteins. This association is of clinical significance. Low plasma levels of either FVIII or vWF have long been established as causes of excess bleeding. Conversely, there is accumulating evidence that elevated FVIII-vWF levels may represent an important risk factor for ischaemic heart disease and venous thromboembolic disease. In spite of the well-documented association between ABO blood group and FVIII-vWF levels, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. However, it has been established that the ABO effect is primarily mediated through a direct functional effect of the ABO locus on plasma vWF levels. Theoretically, ABO blood group may alter the rate of vWF synthesis or secretion within endothelial cells. Alternatively, ABO group may affect vWF plasma clearance rates. ABH antigenic determinants have been identified on the N-linked oligosaccharide chains of circulating vWF and FVIII, according to the blood group of the individual. It remains unclear whether these carbohydrate structures are responsible for mediating the effect of ABO blood group on plasma vWF levels.
PC sound cards can be used for processing the data of bioelectric activity tests. The study of phenazepam effect upon the rat EEG showed that a PC sound card with the corresponding sound processing files can reveal the tranquilizer effects in EEG with the aid of standard analog-to-digital converters and bioelectric data processing routines. The obtained results show expediency of using the PC sound cards for the cerebral activity testing data processing.
PTEN tumor suppressor is frequently mutated in human cancers and is a negative regulator of PI3'K/PKB/Akt-dependent cellular survival. Investigation of the human genomic PTEN locus revealed a p53 binding element directly upstream of the PTEN gene. Deletion and mutation analyses showed that this element is necessary for inducible transactivation of PTEN by p53. A p53-independent element controlling constitutive expression of PTEN was also identified. In contrast to p53 mutant cell lines, induction of p53 in primary and tumor cell lines with wild-type p53 increased PTEN mRNA levels. PTEN was required for p53-mediated apoptosis in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Our results reveal a unique role for p53 in regulation of cellular survival and an interesting connection in tumor suppressor signaling.
CFTR channels mediate secretion and absorption in epithelia, and cystic fibrosis is caused by their malfunction. CFTR proteins are members of the ABC transporter family and are complexly regulated by phosphorylation and nucleosides; they also influence other channel activity. Do CFTR molecules also influence one another? Cooperativity has been observed among other channels and has been suggested for CFTR. Therefore, we looked for evidence of cooperativity among CFTR channels using three independent approaches. All three methods provided evidence for cooperativity in CFTR gating. We estimated mean open times, independent of the number of channels in the patch, in multi-channel patches and showed that, on average, they increased as channel number increased. We observed many trials having larger than expected variances, consistent with cooperative gating. We also measured deviations from binomial statistics, which revealed cooperativity and further indicated that its magnitude is underestimated to an unknown extent because of masking that occurs when CFTR channel populations within a single patch have heterogeneous open probabilities. Simulations showed that the observed departures from binomial statistics were too large to have arisen by chance. The evidence that CFTR P(o) increases with channel density has important functional implications.
PTEN (also known as MMAC-1 or TEP-1) is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressors in human cancer. It is also essential for embryonic development. PTEN functions primarily as a lipid phosphatase to regulate crucial signal transduction pathways; a key target is phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. In addition, it displays weak tyrosine phosphatase activity, which may downmodulate signaling pathways that involve focal adhesion kinase (FAK) or Shc. Levels of PTEN are regulated in embryos and adult organisms, and gene-targeting studies demonstrate that it has a crucial role in normal development. Functions for PTEN have been identified in the regulation of many normal cell processes, including growth, adhesion, migration, invasion and apoptosis. PTEN appears to play particularly important roles in regulating anoikis (apoptosis of cells after loss of contact with extracellular matrix) and cell migration. Gene targeting and transient expression studies have provided insight into the specific signaling pathways that regulate these processes. Characterization of the diverse signaling networks modulated by PTEN, as well as the regulation of PTEN concentration, enzymatic activity, and coordination with other phosphatases, should provide intriguing new insight into the biology of normal and malignant cells.
NSF is an ATPase required for the fusion of secretory vesicles with plasma membrane. Conditional comatose (Drosophila homolog of N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion factor (NSF)) mutations in Drosophila block synaptic transmission at restrictive temperature. Current models hold that NSF-mediated dissociation of SNARE (SNAp REceptor) complexes on mature synaptic vesicles primes them for exocytic release. Paralysis in comt mutants thus reflects defective exocytosis due to buildup of unresolved SNARE complexes. Here, we analyze effects of blocking synaptic vesicle recycling on behavioral, physiological and biochemical phenotypes of comt. Behavioral recovery of comt animals and recovery of comt synapses, as assayed by electroretinograms, after exposure to high temperature is faster if synaptic vesicle recycling is simultaneously blocked using shi(ts) mutants. Concurrently, 7S complex buildup in comt shi double mutants is substantially lower than in comt mutants alone. In addition, we find that 7S complexes can form on presynaptic plasma membrane if NSF is inhibited after synaptic-vesicle depletion. Thus, our experiments demonstrate a need for continuous NSF activity required not only for dissociating cis-SNARE complexes on plasma membrane after exocytosis, but also for maintaining these cis-SNARE complexes in a dissociated state.
CYP2C9 polymorphisms reported in Caucasians (Arg144Cys in exon 3 and Ile359Leu in exon 7) are extremely uncommon in Chinese persons. The genotype of CYP2C9 in this population was characterized to investigate its relation with the interindividual variation in warfarin dosages. Eighty-nine Chinese patients receiving warfarin were recruited. Target sequences in CYP2C9 in exons 1, 4, and 5 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, followed by direct sequencing. Polymorphisms at 4 positions were demonstrated in exon 4. Heterozygosities for 608TTG>GTG (Leu208Val), 561CAG>CCG (Gln192Pro), 537CAT>CCT (His184Pro), and 527ATT>CTT (Ile181Leu) existed at frequencies 0.75, 0.20, 0.10, and 0.09, respectively. Seventeen patients (frequency, 0.19) were homozygous for Val208. The common genotypic combinations at these loci are Ile181/His184/Gln192/Leu208Val (n = 50), Ile181/His184/Gln192/Val208 (n = 15), Ile181/His184/Gln192/Leu208 (n = 4), Ile181/His184/Gln192Pro/Leu208Val (n = 6), Ile181/His184Pro/Gln192Pro/Leu208Val (n = 4), and Ile181Leu/His184/Gln192Pro/ Leu208Val (n = 4). At codon 208, heterozygous Leu208Val and homozygous Val208 appeared to have a lower warfarin dose requirement than the homozygous Leu208. Patients who are heterozygous for Ile181Leu had a higher warfarin dose requirement than the homozygous Ile181. Amplified sequences in exons 1 and 5 did not exhibit polymorphism. In conclusion, Chinese patients showed genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C9 in exon 4 and at codon 208; most were heterozygous Leu208Val and homozygous Val208. Homozygous Leu208, a common allele in Caucasians, is uncommon in this cohort. The significance of these CYP2C9 polymorphic alleles remains to be determined.
CD38 expression was investigated in 161 untreated patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). A score system, devised ad hoc by integrating the percentage and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of CD38(+) cells, indicated that B-CLL patients with a CD38 score < or =3 are characterized by a significantly longer survival compared to those with a CD38 score >3 (P=0.0026). Thirty-seven percent of patients with a CD38 score < or =3 and 58% of those with a score >3 were dead at 10 years. Multivariate analysis indicates that only the CD38 score successfully predicts survival (P=0.0028), with an estimated 3.8-fold greater risk of death for those cases with CD38 score >3.
CYP2C9 mediates the oxidative metabolism of approximately 10% of drugs, some of which are characterized by a narrow therapeutic index. We aimed to validate genotype method and phenotype methodology, for evaluation of CYP2C9 activity in vivo. Thirty-one healthy subjects (22 male) received a single 300 mg dose of phenytoin. Blood was drawn periodically and urine was collected at intervals for 96 h. Plasma phenytoin and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (p-HPPH) and urine S and R enantiomers of p-HPPH were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. CYP2C9 genotyping was obtained by polymerase chain reaction followed by digestion with Sau96I and StyI for the identification of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, respectively. Eighteen subjects were CYP2C9*1 homozygous, seven were CYP2C9*2 heterozygous, four were CYP2C9*3 heterozygous, one was CYP2C9*2 homozygous and one was compound CYP2C9*2/CYP2C9*3 heterozygous. The allele frequencies of CYP2C9*1, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 were 0.76 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-0.79], 0.16 (95% CI 0.13-0.19) and 0.08 (95% CI 0.05-0.11), respectively. The CYP2C9-mediated production of (S)-p-HPPH represented the major metabolic pathway of phenytoin biotransformation as its excretion accounted for 95.6 + 0.9% of 'total' p-HPPH excretion over the 96 h collection interval. Phenytoin metabolic clearance to produce (S)-p-HPPH (PMC), correlated significantly with (S)-p-HPPH (or 'total' p-HPPH) content in 0-8, 0-12 and 0-24 urine collections (r = 0.88, 0.85 and 0.89, respectively) and with phenytoin metabolic ratio (PMR) defined as the ratio of urine (S)-p-HPPH (or 'total' p-HPPH) to mid-interval plasma phenytoin (r = 0.90, 0.88 and 0.94, respectively). PMC and PMR exhibited a gene-dose effect so that the highest and lowest values were noted in homozygous subjects CYP2C9*1 and subjects carrying two defective alleles, respectively, whereas heterozygous subjects had intermediate values. CYP2C9 genotyping and several phenytoin metabolic indices are correlated with CYP2C9 activity in vivo. The utility of phenytoin to predict the metabolism of other CYP2C9 substrates justifies further evaluation.
CYP2A6 is an hepatic enzyme predominantly with some expression in specialized extrahepatic cell types. The CYP2A6 enzyme has a somewhat restricted active site, accepting only a few xenobiotics as substrates. Interest in CYP2A6 has risen considerably after nicotine and some tobacco specific nitrosamines were established as high-affinity substrates for this enzyme. Recently, the organization and structures of the CYP2A gene cluster and several polymorphic alleles of the CYP2A6 gene have been characterized. Two alleles with a point mutation and at least three different types of gene deletion, all leading to deficient gene function, have been found. The frequencies of these alleles vary considerably among different ethnic populations, the deletion alleles being most common in Orientals (up to 20%). The frequency of point mutations are low in all populations studied thus far (< 3%). Several case-control studies have addressed the relationship between CYP2A6 status and smoking habits as well as the role of CYP2A6 polymorphism in lung cancer risk. Studies in Japanese suggest that CYP2A6 poor metabolizer genotypes result in altered nicotine kinetics and may lower cigarette smoking elicited lung cancer risk, whereas similar studies in Caucasian populations have not revealed any clear associations between variant CYP2A6 genotypes and smoking behaviour or lung cancer predisposition.
CYP2C9 is a major enzyme in human drug metabolism and the polymorphism observed in the corresponding gene may affect the therapeutic outcome during treatment with several drugs. The distribution of variant CYP2C9 alleles was therefore investigated in an Italian and an Ethiopian population.
CD38 is a bifunctional enzyme synthesizing (ADP-ribosyl cyclase) and degrading (cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) hydrolase) cADPR, a potent Ca(2+) mobilizer from intracellular pools. CD38 internalization has been proposed as a mechanism by which the ectoenzyme produced intracellular cADPR, and thiol compounds have been shown to induce the internalization of CD38. Here, we show that the disulfide bond between Cys-119 and Cys-201 in CD38 may be involved in CD38 dimerization and internalization. We tested the effect of a reducing agent, l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTC), a prodrug of cysteine, on CD38 internalization in pancreatic islets. OTC enhanced insulin release from isolated islets as well as CD38 internalization and cytoplasmic Ca(2+) level. Furthermore, islet cells treated with antisense CD38 oligonucleotide showed inhibition of OTC-induced insulin secretion. Intake of OTC in db/db mice ameliorated glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and morphology of islets when compared with control mice. These data indicate that OTC improves glucose tolerance by enhancing insulin secretion via CD38/cADPR/Ca(2+) signaling machinery. Thus, OTC may represent a novel class of antidiabetic drug.
UCP3 is a mitochondrial membrane transporter that is postulated to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis producing heat instead of ATP. Human UCP3 is mainly expressed in skeletal muscle, which plays an important role in energy homeostasis and substrate oxidation. Therefore, UCP3 is a good candidate gene for obesity.
CS mice exhibit a spontaneous splitting in the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity under constant darkness, suggesting that they contain two weakly coupled oscillators in the circadian clock system regulating locomotor activity rhythm. In order to clarify whether the two oscillators are located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a site of the master circadian pacemaker in mammals, circadian rhythms in mRNA of mouse Period genes (mPer1, mPer2 and mPer3) in the SCN and cerebral cortex were examined during rhythm splitting by in situ hybridization. In the SCN, mPer1 and mPer2 showed a circadian rhythm with a single peak in both split and unsplit mice. The rhythms of mPer1 and mPer2 were slightly phase delayed during rhythm splitting in reference to the activity onset, but the phase relationship between the two rhythms was not changed. In the cerebral cortex, the expression of mPer1 and mPer2 underwent the bimodal fluctuation with peaks temporally corresponding to split activity components. The unsplit mice showed the circadian rhythms with a single peak. There was no difference in the mPer3 rhythms in either the SCN or the cerebral cortex between the split and unsplit mice. These results indicate that the circadian oscillations of mPer1, mPer2 and mPer3 in the SCN are not related to the rhythm splitting of CS mice. The split rhythms of the CS mice are suggested to be caused by uncoupling of oscillators located outside the SCN from the SCN circadian pacemaker.
CYP2A6 (cytochrome P450 2A6), which was first identified as the human coumarin 7-hydroxylase, is the most important enzyme in nicotine C-oxidation. The enzyme also metabolically activates the tobacco specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) in vitro. Polymorphisms in the CYP2A6 gene may thus impact on both smoking behavior and lung cancer susceptibility. Several different genotyping methods have been reported with conflicting results in the frequencies of CYP2A6 polymorphic variants. Thus we decided to perform a sequence analysis of the entire CYP2A6 gene. Sequencing confirmed the published CYP2A6 cDNA sequence. However, intron sequences differed considerably from the reported sequence of the CYP2A6*3 (v2) variant. Our analyses revealed that parts of introns shared homologies with the published sequence of CYP2A13. Based on our sequence data we developed a one step protocol for specific amplification of exon 3 of CYP2A6. The resulting PCR product can be used directly for restriction endonuclease digestion with XcmI and DdeI to determine the frequencies of the reported variant alleles CYP2A6*2 and CYP2A6*3. In a population of 305 African-Americans and 145 Caucasians, we found allele frequencies of 0.003 (2/610) for CYP2A6*2 and 0 (0/610) for CYP2A6*3 in African-Americans and allele frequencies of 0.014 (4/290) and 0 (0/290) in Caucasians. We conclude that both alleles are considerably less frequent in populations than previously reported.
PTEN is a 3'-inositol lipid phosphatase that dephosphorylates products of PI 3-kinase. Since PI 3-kinase is required for many metabolic actions of insulin, we investigated the role of PTEN in insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4. In control rat adipose cells, we observed a approximately 2-fold increase in cell surface GLUT4 upon maximal insulin stimulation. Overexpression of wild-type PTEN abolished this response to insulin. Translocation of GLUT4 in cells overexpressing PTEN mutants without lipid phosphatase activity was similar to that observed in control cells. Overexpression of PTEN-CBR3 (mutant with disrupted membrane association domain) partially impaired translocation of GLUT4. In Cos-7 cells, overexpression of wild-type PTEN had no effect on ERK2 phosphorylation in response to acute insulin stimulation. However, Elk-1 phosphorylation in response to chronic insulin treatment was significantly decreased. Thus, when PTEN is overexpressed, both its lipid phosphatase activity and subcellular localization play a role in antagonizing metabolic actions of insulin that are dependent on PI 3-kinase but independent of MAP kinase. However, because translocation of GLUT4 in cells overexpressing a dominant inhibitory PTEN mutant (C124S) was similar to that of control cells, we conclude that endogenous PTEN may not modulate metabolic functions of insulin under normal physiological conditions.
CYP2C9 is the major P450 2C enzyme in human liver and contributes to the metabolism of a number of clinically important substrate drugs. This polymorphically expressed enzyme has been studied in Caucasian, Asian, and to some extent in African American populations, but little is known about the genetic variation in Native American populations. We therefore determined the 2C9*2 (Arg144Cys) and 2C9*3 (Ile359Leu) allele frequencies in 153 Native Canadian Indian (CNI) and 151 Inuit subjects by PCR-RFLP techniques. We also present genotyping data for two reference populations, 325 Caucasian (white North American) and 102 Chinese subjects. Genotyping analysis did not reveal any 2C9*4 alleles in the CNI, Inuit, Caucasian, or Chinese individuals. The 2C9*2 allele appears to be absent in Chinese and Inuit populations, but was present in CNI and Caucasian subjects at frequencies of 0.03 and 0.08-0.15, respectively. The 2C9*3 allele was not detected in the Inuit group, but occured in the CNI group (f = 0.06) at a frequency comparable to that of other ethnic groups. This group of Inuit individuals are the first population in which no 2C9*2 or *3 alleles have been detected so far. Therefore, these alleles may be extremely rare or absent, and unless other novel polymorphisms exist in this Inuit group one would not anticipate any CYP2C9 poor metabolizer subjects among this population.
CD38 identifies a surface molecule with multi-functional activity. Its prognostic importance in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is currently under investigation in view of the fact that two different groups have recently indicated that CD38 expression could be an independent prognostic marker in B-CLL. We analyzed the clinico-biological features of 61 immunologically typical (CD5+CD23+) B-CLL patients stratified according to the CD38 expression. Twenty-two (36%) patients expressed CD38 in more than 30% of CD19-positive cells and were considered as CD38-positive B-CLL. Atypical morphology (p 0.02), peripheral blood lymphocytosis (p 0.01) and diffuse histopathologic bone marrow pattern (p 0.003) were findings found to be closely associated with CD38 expression. On the other hand, A and B Binet stages (p 0.02) and interstitial bone marrow involvement (p 0.005) were more represented in the CD38-negative B-CLL group. Trisomy 12 was detected more frequently in the CD38-positive B-CLL group, while 13q14 deletions mainly occurred in CD38-negative group (p 0.005). Finally, median survival of CD38-positive B-CLL patients was 90 months, while it was not reached at 180 months in CD38-negative patients. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that the evaluation of CD38 expression may identify two groups patients with B-CLL greatly differing in their clinico-biological features.
ABCA1 plays a key role in cellular cholesterol and phospholipid traffic. To explore the biochemical properties of this membrane protein we applied a Baculovirus-insect cell expression system. We found that human ABCA1 in isolated membranes showed a specific, Mg(2+)-dependent ATP binding but had no measurable ATPase activity. Nevertheless, conformational changes in ABCA1 could be demonstrated by nucleotide occlusion, even without arresting the catalytic cycle by phosphate-mimicking anions. Addition of potential lipid substrates or lipid acceptors (apolipoprotein A-I) did not modify the ATPase activity or nucleotide occlusion by ABCA1. Our data indicate that ATP hydrolysis by ABCA1 occurs at a very low rate, suggesting that ABCA1 may not function as an effective active transporter as previously assumed. In the light of the observed conformational changes we propose a regulatory function for human ABCA1.
"PTEN is a tumor suppressor protein that functions, in large part, by dephosphorylating the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and by doing so antagonizing the action of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. PTEN structural domains include an N-terminal phosphatase domain, a lipid-binding C2 domain, and a 50-amino acid C-terminal tail that contains a PDZ binding sequence. We showed previously that phosphorylation of the PTEN tail negatively regulates PTEN activity. We now show that phosphorylated PTEN exists in a monomeric ""closed"" conformation and has low affinity for PDZ domain-containing proteins. Conversely, when unphosphorylated, PTEN is in an ""open"" conformation, is recruited into a high molecular weight complex (PTEN-associated complex), and strongly interacts with PDZ-containing proteins such as MAGI-2. As a consequence, when compared with wild-type PTEN, the phosphorylation-deficient mutant form of PTEN strongly cooperates with MAGI-2 to block Akt activation. These results indicate that phosphorylation of the PTEN tail causes a conformational change that results in the masking of the PDZ binding domain. Consequently, the ability of PTEN to bind to PDZ domain-containing proteins is reduced dramatically. These data suggest that phosphorylation of the PTEN tail suppresses the activity of PTEN by controlling the recruitment of PTEN into the PTEN-associated complex."
CYP3A4 is the most abundant isoform of cytochrome P450 (CYP) in adult human liver. It metabolizes numerous clinically, physiologically, and toxicologically important compounds. The expression of CYP3A4 varies 40-fold in individual human livers, and metabolism of CYP3A4 substrates varies at least 10-fold in vivo. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP3A4 were identified by direct sequencing of genomic DNA in 72 individuals from three different ethnic groups, including Caucasians, Blacks (African-Americans and African pygmies), and Asians. A total of 28 SNPs were identified, including five which produced coding changes M445T (CYP3A4*3), R162Q (CYP3A4*15), F189S (CYP3A4*17), L293P (CYP3A4*18), and P467S (CYP3A4*19). The latter four represent new alleic variants. Racial variability was observed for the frequency of individual SNPs. CYP3A R162Q was identified only in Black populations with an allelic frequency of 4%. CYP3A4 F189S and CYP3A4 M445T were identified in Caucasians with allelic frequencies 2% and 4%, respectively. L293P and P467S were only observed in Asians at allelic frequencies of 2%. The cDNAs for the F189S, L293P, M445T, and P467S mutant alleles were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in an Escherichia coli expression system. Testosterone and the insecticide chlorpyrifos were used to assess the catalytic activities of the most common CYP3A4 allele (CYP3A4*1) and its allelic variants. CYP3A4 F189S exhibited lower turnover numbers for testosterone and chlorpyrifos, while CYP3A4 L293P had higher turnover numbers for both substrates. The turnover numbers of the CYP3A4 M445T and P467S alleles to metabolize these compounds were not significantly different from those of wild-type CYP3A4.
"PPT1 and PPT2 encode two lysosomal thioesterases that catalyze the hydrolysis of long chain fatty acyl CoAs. In addition to this function, PPT1 (palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1) hydrolyzes fatty acids from modified cysteine residues in proteins that are undergoing degradation in the lysosome. PPT1 deficiency in humans causes a neurodegenerative disorder, infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (also known as infantile Batten disease). In the current work, we engineered disruptions in the PPT1 and PPT2 genes to create ""knockout"" mice that were deficient in either enzyme. Both lines of mice were viable and fertile. However, both lines developed spasticity (a ""clasping"" phenotype) at a median age of 21 wk and 29 wk, respectively. Motor abnormalities progressed in the PPT1 knockout mice, leading to death by 10 mo of age. In contrast, the majority of PPT2 mice were alive at 12 mo. Myoclonic jerking and seizures were prominent in the PPT1 mice. Autofluorescent storage material was striking throughout the brains of both strains of mice. Neuronal loss and apoptosis were particularly prominent in PPT1-deficient brains. These studies provide a mouse model for infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and further suggest that PPT2 serves a role in the brain that is not carried out by PPT1."
CD36 deficiency is reportedly an underlying factor about insulin resistance, defective fatty acid metabolism and hypertriglyceridemia in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), and may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia in humans.
CYP2D6 is a highly polymorphic human gene responsible for a large variability in the disposition of more than 100 drugs to which humans may be exposed. Animal models are inadequate for preclinical pharmacological evaluation of CYP2D6 substrates because of marked species differences in CYP2D isoforms. To overcome this issue, a transgenic mouse line expressing the human CYP2D6 gene was generated. The complete wild-type CYP2D6 gene, including its regulatory sequence, was microinjected into a fertilized FVB/N mouse egg, and the resultant offspring were genotyped by both polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting. CYP2D6-specific protein expression was detected in the liver, intestine, and kidney from only the CYP2D6 humanized mice. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that debrisoquine (DEB) clearance was markedly higher (94.1 +/- 22.3 l/h/kg), and its half-life significantly reduced (6.9 +/- 1.6 h), in CYP2D6 humanized mice compared with wild-type animals (15.2 +/- 0.9 l/h/kg and 16.5 +/- 4.5 h, respectively). Mutations in hepatic nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), a hepatic transcription factor known to regulate in vitro expression of the CYP2D6 gene, could affect the disposition of CYP2D6 drug substrates. To determine whether the HNF4alpha gene modulates in vivo pharmacokinetics of CYP2D6 substrates, a mouse line carrying both the CYP2D6 gene and the HNF4alpha conditional mutation was generated and phenotyped using DEB. After deletion of HNF4alpha, DEB 4-hydroxylase activity in CYP2D6 humanized mice decreased more than 50%. The data presented in this study show that only CYP2D6 humanized mice but not wild-type mice display significant DEB 4-hydroxylase activity and that HNF4alpha regulates CYP2D6 activity in vivo. The CYP2D6 humanized mice represent an attractive model for future preclinical studies on the pharmacology, toxicology, and physiology of CYP2D6-mediated metabolism.
CAD (caspase-activated DNase) that causes chromosomal DNA fragmentation during apoptosis exists as a complex with ICAD (inhibitor of CAD) in proliferating cells. Here, we report that denatured CAD is functionally refolded with Hsc70-Hsp40 and ICAD. Hsc70-Hsp40 suppresses the aggregation of the denatured CAD, but cannot restore its enzymatic activity. In contrast, ICAD could not suppress the aggregation of CAD, but supported the CAD's renaturation with Hsc70-Hsp40, indicating that ICAD recognizes the quasi-native folding state of CAD that is conferred by Hsc70-Hsp40. Using an in vitro translation system, we then showed that during CAD translation, Hsc70-Hsp40 as well as ICAD bind to the nascent CAD polypeptide, while on ribosomes. These results indicate that ICAD together with Hsc70-Hsp40 assists the folding of CAD during its synthesis, and that the CAD*ICAD heterodimer is formed co-translationally.
CD38 is an ectoenzyme, which can produce metabolites with intracellular Ca(2+) mobilizing properties and has multiple immunological functions. However, we have recently shown that CD38 is also localized to the nucleus of rat hepatocyte whereby its metabolite cADPR, is able to mobilize nuclear Ca(2+) stores. In this study, we further characterize the localization of nuclear CD38 in the spleen, an important immune organ. We managed to detect the presence of ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity in the nuclear fraction. With Western blotting, we managed to characterize a 42-45 kDa protein band that is typical of CD38 under reducing and non-reducing conditions. However, as a comparison, other nuclear fractions from tissues like thymus, cardiac muscle and cerebellum yielded an additional 85 kDa protein band under non-reducing conditions. Both protein bands could be blocked with a CD38 blocking peptide. Immunohistochemical studies revealed the expression of CD38 in the marginal zone and in the red pulp. In contrast, the germinal center remained largely immunonegative for CD38. This is the first report of a functionally active ADP-ribosyl cyclase/CD38 in the spleen nuclear fraction. The results here suggest that the presence of CD38 in the nuclear environment might have a corollary to functional and regulatory roles in the nucleus.
CYP1B1 is linked to normal eye development by the disease phenotype, primary congenital glaucoma (PCG). CYP1B1 mRNA was expressed in a number of human fetal tissue cDNA libraries, supporting the suggestion of its involvement in tissue development. Highest expression levels were found in thymus and kidney, followed by spleen. A considerably lower level was observed in lung, cardiac and skeletal muscle. No expression was detected in liver or brain. CYP1B1 is able to metabolize steroid hormones. Testosterone was a poor substrate and activity with progesterone was 6-fold higher, but estradiol was the preferred substrate, exhibiting a greater metabolite profile with CYP1B1 than with CYP1A2. Major metabolites were A-ring hydroxylations (75-80%). Others were 15alpha-, 6alpha-, 16alpha- and 6beta-hydroxy metabolites. Two CYP1B1 mutations found in families with the PCG phenotype in which incomplete penetrance is seen were expressed in Escherichia coli. G61E, a hinge region mutation, and R469W, a heme region mutation, were shown to code for holoenzymes. G61E had greatly diminished stability, while the R469W holoenzyme, if anything, was stabilized. Both mutants showed compromised catalytic activity. The extents of isomeric site activity diminution were not proportional, resulting in alterations in the metabolite profiles. The results suggest that if a metabolite of CYP1B1 or elimination of a metabolite by CYP1B1 is necessary for normal embryonic or fetal tissue development, the appearance of these two mutations could result in developmental abnormalities. The altered activities of the mutants and ability of CYP1B1 to respond to external challenge may be the basis for the observed incomplete penetrance.
SCD is a major health problem requiring lifelong multidisciplinary care to manage the wide range of medical and social consequences. A number of new approaches offer the potential to have an impact on the natural history of this disease.
PTEN is a lipid phosphatase responsible for down-regulating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate is involved in the activation of the anti-apoptotic effector target, Akt. Although the Akt pathway has been implicated in regulating NF-kappaB activity, it is controversial as to whether Akt activates NF-kappaB predominantly through mechanisms that regulate nuclear translocation or transactivation potential. In this report, we utilized PTEN as a natural biological inhibitor of Akt activity to study the effects on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced activation of NF-kappaB. We found that the reintroduction of PTEN into prostate cells inhibited TNF-stimulated NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. PTEN failed to block TNF-induced IKK activation, IkappaBalpha degradation, p105 processing, p65 (RelA) nuclear translocation, and DNA binding of NF-kappaB. However, PTEN inhibited NF-kappaB-dependent transcription by blocking the ability of TNF to stimulate the transactivation domain of the p65 subunit. PTEN also inhibited the transactivation potential of the cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein, but this was not observed for c-Jun. The transactivation potential of p65 following TNF stimulation could be rescued from PTEN-dependent repression by re-introducing expression constructs encoding activated forms of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt, or Akt and IKK. The ability of PTEN to inhibit the TNF-induced transactivation function of p65 is important, because expression of PTEN blocked TNF-stimulated NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression, thus sensitizing cells to TNF-induced apoptosis. Maintenance of the PTEN tumor suppressor protein is therefore required to modulate Akt activity and to concomitantly control the transcriptional activity of the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB.
SULT1A1 enzyme is a member of the sulfotransferase family that alters biological activities of numerous carcinogenic and mutagenic compounds through sulfation. A genetic polymorphism in the coding region of SULT1A1 gene has been associated with modulated enzyme activity. There is a G-->A nucleotide polymorphism in SULT1A1 gene that codes for an Arg-->His substitution, which results in decreased activity and thermal stability of the SULT1A1 enzyme. Utilizing a case-control study design, we hypothesized that the variant allele of the SULT1A1 gene may be associated with lung cancer risk. The PCR-RFLP assay was used to successfully genotype the SULT1A1*2 allele (variant A-allele) in 463 Caucasian lung cancer cases and 485 frequency matched Caucasian controls. There was an overall significant difference between cases and controls when adjusted by sex and smoking status (adjusted OR=1.41, 95% CI: 1.04-1.91). The adjusted OR was higher for females (OR=1.64, 95% CI: 1.06-2.56) than for males (OR=1.23, 95% CI: 0.80-1.88). Furthermore, the risk was significantly higher in current smokers (OR=1.74, 95% CI: 1.08-2.29) and heavy smokers (OR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.05-2.00). Our results support the hypothesis that a genetic polymorphism in the SULT1A1 gene may be associated with increased lung cancer risk.
PDE7A is a recently described 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) whose expression has been detected in T-cells. As treatment with the methylxanthine theophylline, a nonspecific PDE inhibitor, induces apoptosis in leukemic cells from patients with the B-lineage malignancy chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we sought to determine if PDE7A was a target of theophylline therapy in such cells. Western analysis revealed expression of PDE7A in normal human splenic B-cells, primary CLL cells, and in a CLL-derived cell line (WSU-CLL). Among the six cAMP PDEs (PDE1B, PDE3B, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4D, and PDE7) examined in WSU-CLL, only PDE7A levels were augmented by treatment with methylxanthines. The activity of PDE7A isolated from the WSU-CLL cell line by immunoprecipitation was inhibited by theophylline and IBMX with IC50 values of 343.5 and 8.6 microM, respectively. WSU-CLL PDE7A was also up-regulated by a novel specific inhibitor (IC242), which inhibits PDE7A from WSU-CLL cells with an IC50 value of 0.84 microM. IC242-mediated up-regulation of PDE7A was blocked by the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89.
ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists may modulate fibrinolysis. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of these drugs on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis.
CD38 expression by B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells has been the focus of several recent studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of CD38 expression by peripheral blood lymphocytes on progression-free survival after first-line therapy with high-dose chlorambucil in 53 previously untreated patients affected by typical CD5+ CD23+ B-CLL.
CD38 expression and chromosomal abnormalities are novel prognostic factors in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). However, their value remains undetermined. CD38 was evaluated in 123 patients and chromosomal aberrations in 111 cases with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). CD38 expression was found in 27% of the cases. In addition, seven out of 32 CD38- patients became CD38+ during evolution of the disease. Chromosomal abnormalities included isolated 13q deletion (40%), 12q trisomy (14%), 11q deletion (without 17p deletion) (14%) and 17p deletion (7%). CD38 expression was significantly associated with Binet stages B and C, atypical morphology and 11q deletion. On univariate analysis of survival estimates, advanced Binet stages, CD38+ phenotype, atypical morphology and 11q or 17p deletions were associated with shorter event-free survival (EFS), treatment-free interval (TFI) and overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis identified both Binet stages and CD38 as independent prognostic factors with regard to EFS and TFI. However, CD38 appeared as an independent factor for OS when restricted to Binet stage A. Chromosomal aberrations were re-evaluated during evolution in 31 cases. The 17p deletion was the most frequent new chromosomal abnormality (35%) and significantly associated with death (64%). In conclusion, CD38 expression and secondary 17p deletion are important poor prognostic indicators, especially in Binet stage A CLL.
CD36 is a multispecific membrane glycoprotein that has been postulated to have a variety of functions. Evidence generated in isolated cells and in mice and rat models of altered CD36 expression has indicated an important role for CD36 in membrane transport of long-chain fatty acids. The cumulative data indicate that CD36 facilitates a major fraction of fatty acid uptake by muscle and fat, and that CD36 deficiency is associated with a large (60-80%) defect in fatty acid uptake by those tissues. In humans, polymorphisms in the CD36 gene may underlie defective fatty acid metabolism and some forms of heart disease. Herein we review our current understanding of the transport function and regulation of CD36. The realization that the transport step rate limits cellular fatty acid utilization suggests that abnormalities in CD36 expression or function may impact on susceptibility to certain metabolic diseases such as obesity and insulin resistance.
CFTR is an apically resident ion channel whose activity is regulated by the activation of the cAMP mediated second messenger cascade. As depicted in textbooks, the cAMP mediated signaling cascade appears deceptively simple, yet, our growing understanding of this pathway shows it to be much more complicated and finely tuned than originally thought. The intent of this review is to evaluate our current understanding of the cAMP mediated signaling as it relates to the secretion of mucin and chloride, two compounds whose regulated secretion is altered in cystic fibrosis.
ACE inhibitors are group of drugs whose use over the last ten years has largely expanded. New members of this group of drugs are developed and registered and today in Croatia exist a dozen ACE inhibitors from different pharmaceutical companies like lisinopril, cilazapril, ramipril, trandolapril, enalapril etc. Notable side effects of ACE inhibitors are: hypotension, dry cough, rash, angioneurotical edema, impaired renal function and acute renal failure. The aim of the article was to present a 72 year old patient with reversible impairment of renal function during treatment with ACE inhibitor lisinopril.
ACE plays an important role in the regulation of arterial pressure; however, a linear relationship between ACE expression and arterial pressure has not been demonstrated. The present study employed telemetric monitoring in female transgenic mice to determine the influence of partial and complete deletion of the ACE gene on basal arterial pressure and arterial pressure responses to a high-NaCl diet. On the basal NaCl diet, 24-hour mean arterial pressure was significantly correlated with the number of functional copies of the ACE gene; ie, arterial pressure was lowest in 0-copy (80 +/- 1 mm Hg), intermediate in 1-copy (100 +/- 1 mm Hg), and highest in 2-copy (113 +/- 1 mm Hg) ACE mice. The high-NaCl diet significantly increased mean arterial pressure in 0-copy (99 +/- 1 mm Hg) and 1-copy (108 +/- 1 mm Hg) mice but not in 2-copy mice (114 +/- 1 mm Hg). These results demonstrate a copy-dependent relationship between ACE gene expression and both basal arterial pressure and arterial pressure responses to a high-NaCl diet, suggesting that either partial or complete reduction in the ACE gene can alter arterial pressure.
CA1 pyramidal cells receive glutamatergic input from the entorhinal cortex through the perforant path (PP) and from CA3 through Schaffer collaterals (SC). The PP input terminates in the stratum lacunosum molecular approximately 300 microm from the cell body, whereas SC synapses have a more proximal location in the stratum radiatum. We compared the properties of AMPA- and NMDA-mediated transmission at these two inputs. The AMPA-mediated components have linear voltage dependence in both inputs. The reversal potential in the PP is only slightly more positive than in the SC, indicating that distal membrane voltage could be effectively set. The NMDA-mediated responses in the two pathways, however, are very different. The PP exhibits inward rectification, as evidenced by very low outward currents. The rectification persists in the absence of extracellular Mg2+. It cannot be attributed to clamping problems, because large outward AMPA currents can be observed even when conditions are modified to have the AMPA currents kinetically match the NMDA currents. Thus, it appears that the PP NMDA channels have novel properties. A second difference between the PP and SC pathways is that the PP has a larger NMDA/AMPA charge ratio. This difference could be observed under many conditions, including block of all voltage-dependent conductances and elimination of the negative resistance of NMDA channels by removing extracellular Mg2+. The difference in ratio thus cannot be attributed to regenerative currents. The higher NMDA component of the distal PP synapses could help to make these synapses more powerful under depolarizing conditions.
FH is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. Based on the crucial role of macrophage LPL in atherogenesis, we determined in the present study macrophage LPL expression in patients with FH. Monocytes isolated from 13 FH patients and 13 control subjects were differentiated into macrophages by culturing the cells for 9 days in 20% autologous or heterologous serum. Macrophages of patients with FH cultured in their own sera showed a significant increase in LPL mRNA levels, extracellular LPL mass, and activity compared with macrophages of control subjects. Although these alterations positively correlated with the levels of serum platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) in FH subjects, increased LPL secretion by cultured FH macrophages was reduced neither by immunoneutralizing FH serum with an anti-PDGF-BB antibody, nor by culturing these cells in sera from control subjects. With the exception of LPL, levels of other cytokines and 8-isoprostane were not increased in the supernatants of macrophages of FH patients. Serum from FH patients also enhances the levels of LPL secreted by macrophages from control subjects. Immunoneutralization of FH serum with an anti-PDGF-BB antibody totally reversed this alteration. Overall, this study demonstrates that macrophages from FH subjects overproduce LPL and that PDGF present in the serum from FH patients stimulates LPL secretion by control macrophages. These findings suggest that macrophage LPL induction in patients with FH might be related to the increased atherogenesis observed in these subjects.
PTEN is a candidate tumour suppressor gene and frequently mutated in multiple cancers, however, not in pancreatic cancer. Recently, it has been demonstrated that PTEN expression is regulated by TGF-beta1. Using TGF-beta1 transgenic mice (n=7) and wildtype littermates (n=6), as well as pancreatic tissues obtained from organ donors (n=10) and patients with pancreatic cancer (n=10), we assessed the expression of PTEN by means of immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative PCR analysis. In addition, PANC-1 cells were treated with TGF-beta1 in vitro and the levels of PTEN mRNA were determined in these cells. In human pancreatic cancers PTEN mRNA levels were significantly decreased (P<0.05). In addition, in the pancreas of TGF-beta1 transgenic mice the expression of PTEN was significantly reduced (P<0.01), as compared to wildtype littermates and incubation of PANC-1 cells with TGF-beta1 decreased PTEN mRNA levels after 24 h. Inasmuch as TGF-beta1 decreases PTEN expression in human pancreatic cancer cells and human pancreatic cancers overexpress TGF-beta1, the reduced expression of PTEN in pancreatic cancer may be mediated by TGF-beta1 overexpression. Thus, although PTEN is not mutated in pancreatic cancers, the reduction of its expression may give pancreatic cancer cells an additional growth advantage.
CD38 is an ectocyclase that converts NAD+ to the Ca2+-releasing second messenger cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPr). Here we report that in addition to CD38 ecto-catalysis, intracellularly expressed CD38 may catalyze NAD+-->cADPr conversion to cause cytosolic Ca2+ release. High levels of CD38 were found in the plasma membranes, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear membranes of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. More important, intracellular CD38 was colocalized with target ryanodine receptors. The cyclase also converted a NAD+ surrogate, NGD+, to its fluorescent product, cGDPr (Km approximately 5.13 microM). NAD+ also triggered a cytosolic Ca2+ signal. Similar results were obtained with NIH3T3 cells, which overexpressed a CD38-EGFP fusion protein. The Delta(-49)-CD38-EGFP mutant with a deleted amino-terminal tail and transmembrane domain appeared mainly in the mitochondria with an expected loss of its membrane localization, but the NAD+-induced cytosolic Ca2+ signal was preserved. Likewise, Ca2+ release persisted in cells transfected with the Myr-Delta(-49)-CD38-EGFP or Delta(-49)-CD38-EGFP-Fan mutants, both directed to the plasma membrane but in an opposite topology to the full-length CD38-EGFP. Finally, ryanodine inhibited Ca2+ signaling, indicating the downstream activation of ryanodine receptors by cADPr. We conclude that intracellularly expressed CD38 might link cellular NAD+ production to cytosolic Ca2+ signaling.
TPK1 and TPK2 encode both isoforms of protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunits in Candida albicans. Mutants lacking both TPK1 alleles showed defective hyphal morphogenesis on solid inducing media, whereas in liquid hypha, formation was affected slightly. In contrast, tpk2 mutants were only partially morphogenesis defective on solid media, whereas a strong block was observed in liquid. In addition, the yeast forms of tpk2-- but not tpk1-- mutants were completely deficient in invading agar. Because Tpk1p and Tpk2p differ in their N-terminal domains of approximately 80--90 amino acids, while the catalytic portions are highly homologous, the functions of hybrid Tpk proteins with exchanged N-terminal domains were tested. The results demonstrate that the catalytic portions mediate Tpk protein specificities with regard to filamentation, whereas agar invasion is mediated by the N-terminal domain of Tpk2p. Homozygous tpk1 and tpk2 mutants grew normally; however, a tpk2 mutant strain containing a single regulatable TPK1 allele (PCK1p-TPK1) at low expression levels was severely growth defective. It was completely blocked in hyphal morphogenesis and was stress resistant to high osmolarities or temperatures. Thus, both Tpk isoforms in C. albicans share growth functions but, unlike Saccharomyces cerevisiae isoforms, they have positive, specific roles in filament formation in different environments.
CYP2C9 wild-type protein has been shown to exhibit atypical kinetic profiles of metabolism that may affect in vitro-in vivo predictions made during the drug development process. Previous work suggests a substrate-dependent effect of polymorphic variants of CYP2C9 on the rate of metabolism; however, it is hypothesized that these active site amino acid changes will affect the kinetic profile of a drug's metabolism as well. To this end, the kinetic profiles of three model CYP2C9 substrates (flurbiprofen, naproxen, and piroxicam) were studied using purified CYP2C9*1 (wild-type) and variants involving active site amino acid changes, including the naturally occurring variants CYP2C9*3 (Leu359) and CYP2C9*5 (Glu360) and the man-made mutant CYP2C9 F114L. CYP2C9*1 (wild-type) metabolized each of the three compounds with a distinctive profile reflective of typical hyperbolic (flurbiprofen), biphasic (naproxen), and substrate inhibition (piroxicam) kinetics. CYP2C9*3 metabolism was again hyperbolic for flurbiprofen, of a linear form for naproxen (no saturation noted), and exhibited substrate inhibition with piroxicam. CYP2C9*5-mediated metabolism was hyperbolic for flurbiprofen and piroxicam but linear with respect to naproxen turnover. The F114L mutant exhibited a hyperbolic kinetic profile for flurbiprofen metabolism, a linear profile for naproxen metabolism, and a substrate inhibition kinetic profile for piroxicam metabolism. In all cases except F114L-mediated piroxicam metabolism, turnover decreased and the K(m) generally increased for each allelic variant compared with wild-type enzyme. It seems that the kinetic profile of CYP2C9-mediated metabolism is dependent on both substrate and the CYP2C9 allelic variant, thus having potential ramifications on drug disposition predictions made during the development process.
CYP2J2 is abundant in cardiovascular tissue and active in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to eicosanoids that possess potent anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and fibrinolytic properties. We cloned and sequenced the entire CYP2J2 gene (approximately 40.3 kb), which contains nine exons and eight introns. We then sequenced the CYP2J2 exons and intron-exon boundaries in 72 healthy persons representing African, Asian, and European/white populations as part of the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Environmental Genome Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Program. A variety of polymorphisms were found, four of which resulted in coding changes (Arg158Cys, Ile192Asn, Asp342Asn, and Asn404Tyr). A fifth variant (Thr143Ala) was identified by screening a human heart cDNA library. All five variant cDNAs of CYP2J2 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Sf9 insect cells by using a baculovirus system. The recombinant wild-type and variant CYP2J2 proteins immunoreacted with peptide-based antibodies to CYP2J2 and displayed typical cytochrome P450 (P450) CO-difference spectra; however, the Asn404Tyr and Ile192Asn variants also had prominent spectral peaks at 420 nm. The ability of these variants to metabolize arachidonic acid and linoleic acid was compared with that of wild-type CYP2J2. Three variants (Asn404Tyr, Arg158Cys, and Thr143Ala) showed significantly reduced metabolism of both arachidonic acid and linoleic acid. The Ile192Asn variant showed significantly reduced activity toward arachidonic acid only. The Asp342Asn variant showed similar metabolism to wild-type CYP2J2 for both endogenous substrates. Based on these data, we conclude that allelic variants of the human CYP2J2 gene exist and that some of these variants result in a P450 protein that has reduced catalytic function. Insofar as CYP2J2 products have effects in the cardiovascular system, we speculate that these variants may be functionally relevant.
PC wheezing (PCw) is defined as the concentration of methacholine at which wheeze is detected on auscultation of the trachea. PCw has been suggested as a measure of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in methacholine challenge testing (MCT).
CYP2C19 is a polymorphically expressed cytochrome P450 responsible for the metabolism of several clinically used drugs, including some barbiturates, diazepam, proguanil, propranolol and several proton pump inhibitors. Genetic polymorphism of this enzyme shows marked interracial differences, with the poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype representing 2-5% of Caucasian and 11-23% of Oriental populations. In the present study, CYP2C19 phenotype and genotype were investigated in 107 North-eastern Thai subjects using the omeprazole hydroxylation index (HI) and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique, respectively. It was found that the distribution of HI in these subjects was bimodal. Seven subjects [6.54%, 95% confidence (CI) 1.86-11.22%] were identified as PM, with an HI > 7. Analysis of CYP2C19 genotypes in these 107 Thai subjects revealed that the allele frequencies for CYP2C19*1, CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 were 0.71 (95% CI 0.65-0.77), 0.27 (95% CI 0.21-0.33) and 0.02 (95% CI 0.01-0.05), respectively. The PM phenotype and the frequencies of CYP2C19 defective alleles in Thais, particularly CYP2C19*3, were lower than those observed in other Oriental populations. It is noteworthy that there was a case of nonaccordance between phenotype and genotype in one of the PMs. Whether this PM represents a novel defective allele requires further investigation.
ACE inhibitory peptides are biologically active peptides that play a role in blood pressure regulation. When derived from food proteins during food processing or gastrointestinal digestion, these peptides could function as efficient agents in treating and preventing hypertension. However, in order to exert an antihypertensive effect by inhibition of the ACE enzyme, they have to reach the bloodstream intact. The aim of this research was to assess if the known ACE inhibitory peptide Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg, derived from a tryptic digest of beta-lactoglobulin, could be absorbed through a Caco-2 Bbe cell monolayer in an Ussing chamber and reach the serosal side undegraded. Samples of the mucosal compartment showed high ACE inhibitory activity. No or only little ACE inhibitory activity was detected in the serosal compartment. However, when the serosal sample was concentrated three-fold, a substantial ACE inhibitory activity was registered. Concomitantly, HPLC and MS clearly showed the presence of Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg in the mucosal compartment, whereas in the serosal compartment only MS was able to detect the heptapeptide. In conclusion. under the observed experimental conditions, the ACE inhibitory peptide Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg was transported intact through the Caco-2 Bbe monolayer, but in concentrations too low to exert an ACE inhibitory activity.
PTEN is a candidate tumor-suppressor gene in a variety of malignant tumors. The prognostic importance of PTEN product protein (PTEN) and its correlation with clinicopathologic characteristics have yet to be delineated in patients with esophageal carcinoma.
PTEN mutation and microsatellite instability are two of the most common genetic alterations in uterine endometrioid carcinoma. Furthermore, previous studies have suggested an association between the two alterations, however the basis and consequence of the association is not understood. Recently it has been shown that 100% of female Pten(+/-) mice develop complex atypical hyperplasia by 32 weeks of age that progresses to endometrial carcinoma in approximately 20 to 25% of mice at 40 weeks. In an attempt to expand this mouse model of endometrial tumorigenesis and to further our understanding of the association betweenPten mutations and DNA mismatch repair deficiency, we generated Ptenheterozygous, Mlh1-null (mismatch repair deficient) mice. Significantly, the majority ofPten(+/-)/Mlh1(-/-)mice developed polypoid lesions in the endometrium at 6 to 9 weeks of age. By 14 to 18 weeks, all of the double-mutant mice had lesions histologically similar to those seen inPten(+/-) mice, and two of them exhibited invasive disease. Moreover, the frequency of loss of the wild-type Pten allele in the double-mutant mice at 14 to 18 weeks was similar to that seen in lesions from 40-week-old Pten(+/-) mice. Taken together, our results indicate that DNA mismatch repair deficiency can accelerate endometrial tumorigenesis inPten heterozygous mice and suggests that loss of the wild-type Pten allele is involved in the development/progression of tumors in this setting.
ACE inhibition exerts an antiproteinuric and renoprotective effect. However, residual proteinuria is often present. As residual proteinuria is associated with a poor renal outcome, identification of its determinants is important. We found previously that the systemic sequelae of proteinuria enhance renal damage in untreated nephrotic rats. The impact of systemic nephrosis on renal therapy response, however, is unclear. In the present study we therefore investigated whether the severity of systemic nephrosis, estimated from plasma cholesterol, predicts residual proteinuria during ACE inhibition.
SULT2A1 catalyzes the sulfate conjugation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as well as other steroids. As a step toward pharmacogenetic studies, we have 'resequenced' SULT2A1 using 60 DNA samples from African-American and 60 samples from Caucasian-American subjects. All exons, splice junctions and approximately 370 bp located 5' of the site of transcription initiation were sequenced. We observed 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including three non-synonymous coding SNPs (cSNPs) that were present only in DNA from African-American subjects. Linkage analysis revealed that two of the nonsynonymous cSNPs were tightly linked. Expression constructs were created for all nonsynonymous cSNPs observed, including a 'double variant' construct that included the two linked cSNPs, and those constructs were expressed in COS-1 cells. SULT2A1 activity was significantly decreased for three of the four variant allozymes. Western blot analysis demonstrated that decreased levels of immunoreactive protein appeared to be the major mechanism responsible for decreases in activity, although apparent Km values also varied among the recombinant allozymes. In addition, the most common of the nonsynonymous cSNPs disrupted the portion of SULT2A1 involved with dimerization, and this variant allozyme behaved as a monomer rather than a dimer during gel filtration chromatography. These observations indicate that common genetic polymorphisms for SULT2A1 can result in reductions in levels of both activity and enzyme protein. They also raise the possibility of ethnic-specific pharmacogenetic variation in SULT2A1-catalyzed sulfation of both endogenous and exogenous substrates for this phase II drug-metabolizing enzyme.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) also referred to as MMAC (mutated in multiple advanced cancers) was discovered as a tumor suppressor gene and later found to be a phospholipid phosphatase. PTEN negatively regulates Akt activation by preventing its phosphorylation. PTEN therefore inhibits the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway which is important for cell growth and survival. Overexpression or enhanced activation of PTEN can potentially impair injury healing by at least 4 mechanisms. PTEN can: 1) inhibit entry into the cell cycle by inhibiting G1 to S phase progression and arrest cell proliferation required for tissue reconstruction during injury healing; 2) increase apoptosis by blocking Akt activation leading to increased Bad and Caspase-9 activities; 3) inhibit hypoxia-induced angiogenesis required for injury healing by blocking Akt-mediated VEGF gene transcription; 4) inhibit Akt-mediated cell migration, i.e. re-epithelialization, which is also required for injury healing. The same mechanisms can also suppress cancer growth and metastases. Therefore, elucidating the role of the PTEN/PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway will likely advance our knowledge of the mechanisms controlling the processes of injury healing and cancer growth.
CHAT and Cox type 1 live-attenuated poliovirus strains were developed in the 1950s to be used as vaccines for humans. This paper describes their characterization with respect to virulence, sensitivity for growth at high temperatures, and complete nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The results are compared to those for their common parental wild virus, the Mahoney strain, and to those for two other poliovirus strains derived from Mahoney, the Sabin 1 vaccine strain and the mouse-adapted LS-a virus. Analysis of four isolates from cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis related to the CHAT vaccine revealed genetic and phenotypic properties of the CHAT strain following replication in the human gut. CHAT-VAPP strain 134 contained a genome highly evolved from that of CHAT (1.1% nucleotide differences), suggesting long-term circulation of a vaccine-derived strain in the human population. The molecular mechanisms of attenuation and evolution of poliovirus in humans are discussed in the context of the global polio eradication initiative.
PTEN is mutated at high frequency in many primary human cancers and several familial cancer predisposition disorders. Activation of AKT is a common event in tumors in which the PTEN gene has been inactivated. We previously showed that deletion of the murine Pten gene in embryonic stem (ES) cells led to increased phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP(3)) accumulation, enhanced entry into S phase, and better cell survival. Since PIP(3) controls multiple signaling molecules, it was not clear to what degree the observed phenotypes were due to deregulated AKT activity. In this study, we mutated Akt-1 in Pten(-/-) ES cells to directly assess the role of AKT-1 in PTEN-controlled cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, cell survival, and tumorigenesis in nude mice. We showed that AKT-1 is one of the major downstream effectors of PTEN in ES cells and that activation of AKT-1 is required for both the cell survival and cell proliferation phenotypes observed in Pten(-/-) ES cells. Deletion of Akt-1 partially reverses the aggressive growth of Pten(-/-) ES cells in vivo, suggesting that AKT-1 plays an essential role in PTEN-controlled tumorigenesis.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that was identified on chromosome 10q23. In addition to its original function as a tumor suppressor, this gene product was recently reported to enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer agents. It is for the purpose of this study to investigate its function and the mechanisms by which PTEN enhances the sensitivity of ovarian cancer to antitumor agents.
UGT1A6 and UGT1A9 have both been demonstrated to rapidly glucuronidate simple phenolic compounds. A series of simple phenols were selected and screened with both isoforms and then used as model substrates for the generation of V(max) and K(m) values. UGT1A6 showed a more restricted acceptance of phenolic substrates compared with UGT1A9. However, the affinity of UGT1A6 for these compounds exhibited higher K(m) values than UGT1A9, although rates of turnover were similar. Molecular surface-weighted holistic invariant molecular descriptors were generated for each substrate and used to produce the first quantitative structure activity relationship models generated for expressed human UGTs. Models relating log of the K(m) value to the generated descriptors correlated well with the experimental data r(2) value of 0.996 for UGT1A6 and r(2) value of 0.83 for UGT1A9. Cross validation by a leave-one-out method also showed good predictive capability within the subset with a q(2) value of 0.98 for UGT1A6 and q(2) value of 0.73 for UGT1A9. Empirically, UGT1A6 V(max) decreased as the 4-substituent increased in size, and a trend was observed when UGT1A6 V(max) was plotted against molecular volume. The larger UGT1A6 substrates were typified by low activity and lower K(m) values than their smaller counterparts. Extrapolating from this, it was demonstrated that phenols with large 4-substituents, which were not UGT1A6 substrates, could inhibit 4-ethylphenol glucuronidation. The K(m) values for UGT1A9 showed a similar relationship to UGT1A6 but with much lower K(m) values and greater variability in range of this value.
CD36 deficiency has been classified in two types, i.e., type I and type II CD36 deficiency. Possible pathological involvement of CD36 deficiency has been suggested in humans, but is still confounding. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations (CD36(-/-)) were demonstrated in type I CD36 deficiency, while the genomic or molecular background of type II CD36 deficiency is still unclear, which may bring confounding interpretations of the cause-and-effect events in human CD36 deficiency. In this study, we analyzed the genotype and frequency of type II CD36 deficiency in Japanese populations, and its hereditary pattern in three families.
LCAT is a key enzyme of reverse cholesterol transport that is essential to maintain HDL-mediated lipid transport and cholesterol homeostasis. Alterations in LCAT expression have a profound effect on plasma HDL cholesterol concentrations. Previously LCAT mRNA and activity were shown to be regulated by several inflammatory cytokines, including the pleiotrophic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). A series of full-length and sequential deletion LCAT promoter constructs were used to determine whether inflammatory stimuli affect LCAT transcription and to further identify functional, cytokine-responsive promoter regions that mediate this response. Using transfected HepG2 cells, results indicate that treatment with IL-6 induced a 2.5-fold activation of full-length LCAT promoter activity. A minimal (-1514 bp to -1508 bp) IL-6 response element with high sequence homology to the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family member, STAT3, was mapped within the distal promoter and shown to be sufficient to mediate the IL-6 response. Further, overexpression of STAT3 significantly enhanced the effect of IL-6 on LCAT promoter activity. These data suggest that the IL-6 responsive transcription factor, STAT3, contributes to LCAT transcriptional regulation. The elucidation of distinct biochemical signaling pathways associated with inflammation may provide new insight into transcriptional regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism.
PTEN is a tumor-suppressor gene with phosphatase activity that is mutated in a variety of cancers. We analyzed a series of 34 invasive and 18 in situ breast cancers with known molecular status of the PTEN genotype using immunohistochemistry. Reduced PTEN protein expression was seen in 38% of invasive cancers and in 11% of in situ cancers. The frequency of reduced expression was highest in stage II and III cancers. Reduced expression also correlated with aneuploidy. In addition, in tumors with both in situ and invasive components, expression within the ductal carcinoma in situ portion tended to reflect the expression pattern of the invasive component. These data suggest that PTEN expression is frequently reduced in advanced breast cancers.
AQP10 is the newest member of aquaporins in mammals and expressed selectively in the duodenum and the jejunum in human functioning as aquaglyceroporin. Here we report the cloning of the mouse AQP10 gene. The gene is composed of six exons and spans 5.2 kb. The arrangement of the exons is well conserved between mouse and human. However, the initiator methionine is lost because of the mutation at the translation-initiation site. An insertion of four thymine residues in exon 2 and a deletion of a cytosine residue in exon 5 shift the reading frame. Moreover, aberrant exon/intron junction sequences of introns 2, 3, and 4 also shift the reading frame between exons. Genomic Southern blot revealed the mouse AQP10 gene as a single copy gene. The results indicate that the mouse AQP10 gene is a pseudogene. Furthermore, the mouse AQP10 transcript was not detected in the jejunum where the human AQP10 is strongly expressed.
PTEN is a lipid phosphatase, and PTEN mutations are associated with gliomas, macrocephaly, and mental deficiencies. We have used PTEN +/- mice to assess PTEN's role in subventricular zone (SVZ) precursor cells. For cultured SVZ neurosphere cells, haploinsufficiency for PTEN increases phosphorylation of Akt and forkhead transcription factor and slightly enhances proliferation. Based on a filter penetration assay, PTEN +/- cells are substantially more migratory and invasive than +/+ cells. The +/- cells also are more resistant to H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. Analysis of PTEN +/- and +/+ mice by BrdU labeling reveals no difference in the rate of cell proliferation in the SVZ. Exit of BrdU-labeled cells from the SVZ and radial migration to the outer layers of the olfactory bulb are more rapid for +/- cells. These observations indicate that PTEN regulates SVZ precursor cell function and is particularly important for migration and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress.
ACE inhibitors have been used extensively in heart failure, where they induce systemic vasodilatation. ACE inhibitors have also been shown to reduce ischemic events after myocardial infarction, although their mechanisms of action on the coronary circulation are less well understood. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects and the mechanism of action of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat and the AT1 antagonist losartan on regional myocardial perfusion and coronary flow and vasodilator reserve in conscious dogs with pacing-induced dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).
NOS3 (endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase) and p22phox (subunit of NAD(P)H oxidase) are two genes whose products are involved in formation and degradation of NO, a ubiquitous signaling molecule largely responsible for the maintenance of normal endothelial function. The G894T polymorphism of NOS3 and the C242T polymorphism of p22phox are reportedly associated with numerous cardiovascular diseases. For each polymorphism we developed a rapid and reliable method with the hybridization probes format on the LightCycler and compared it with conventional PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis with regard to reliability, duration and cost. The new methods are more reliable, faster and less expensive than PCR-RFLP analysis and therefore represent a significant advantage in the detection of two candidate risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.
SLC19A2 is a membrane thiamine transporter expressed in a variety of human tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract. Little is currently known about the structure/function relationship of SLC19A2. We examined the effect of introducing mutations in SLC19A2 identical to those found in thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome (TRMA), on functional activity and membrane expression of the transporter. We also examined the effect of mutating the only conserved anionic residue (E138) in the transmembrane (TM) domains of the SLC19A2 and that of the putative glycosylation sites (N63, N314). Northern blot analysis showed SLC19A2 mRNA was expressed at the same level in HeLa cells transfected with wild-type or mutated SLC19A2. Introducing the clinically relevant mutations (D93H, S143F, G172D) or mutation at the conserved anionic residue (E138A) of SLC19A2 led to a significant (P < 0.01) inhibition of thiamine uptake. Mutations of the two potential N-linked glycosylation sites (N63Q, N314Q) of SLC19A2 did not affect functional activity; they did, however, lead to a noticeable reduction in apparent molecular weight of protein. Western blot analysis showed all proteins (except D93H) were expressed in the membrane (not the cytoplasmic) fraction of HeLa cells. These results provide direct confirmation that clinically relevant mutations in SLC19A2 observed in TRMA cause malfunctioning of the transporter and/or a defect in its translation/stability. Results also show conserved TM anionic residue of the SLC19A2 protein is critical for its function. Furthermore, native SLC19A2 is glycosylated, but this is not important for its function.
G6PD deficiency is a widespread abnormality of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, a red cell enzyme, which gives rise to hemolysis under oxidative stress. In Turkey, G6PD deficiency has a variable frequency in different regions. The prevalence and genotypes of G6PD deficiency are not known in Denizli province of the Aegean region of Turkey. Accordingly, this study was designed to investigate the prevalence of enzyme deficiency and the distribution of the Mediterranean mutation of G6PD in this region.
DGAT1 encodes diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase (EC ), a microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the final step of triglyceride synthesis. It became a functional candidate gene for lactation traits after studies indicated that mice lacking both copies of DGAT1 are completely devoid of milk secretion, most likely because of deficient triglyceride synthesis in the mammary gland. Our mapping studies placed DGAT1 close to the region of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on bovine chromosome 14 for variation in fat content of milk. Sequencing of DGAT1 from pooled DNA revealed significant frequency shifts at several variable positions between groups of animals with high and low breeding values for milk fat content in different breeds (Holstein-Friesian, Fleckvieh, and Braunvieh). Among the variants was a nonconservative substitution of lysine by alanine (K232A), with the lysine-encoding allele being associated with higher milk fat content. Haplotype analysis indicated the lysine variant to be ancestral. Two animals that were typed heterozygous (Qq) at the QTL based on marker-assisted QTL-genotyping were heterozygous for the K232A substitution, whereas 14 animals that are most likely qq at the QTL were homozygous for the alanine-encoding allele. An independent association study in Fleckvieh animals confirmed the positive effect of the lysine variant on milk fat content. We consider the nonconservative K232A substitution to be directly responsible for the QTL variation, although our genetic studies cannot provide formal proof.
ACE inhibitors may have a cardioprotective effect by enhancing bradykinin levels during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). However, ACE inhibition could lead to unwelcome effects on the kallikrein contact phase during CPB (since reduction of kallikrein activity by aprotinin has been shown to be beneficial) and may alter the hemostasis. We examined the effects of ACE inhibitors on intraoperative myocardial damage, kallikrein contact phase and hemostasis in patients undergoing CPB.
PTEN is a tumour suppressor gene involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis and mediation of adhesion and migration signalling. Germline mutations of PTEN in humans are associated with familial tumour syndromes, among them Cowden disease. Glioblastomas, highly malignant glial tumours of the central nervous system frequently show loss of PTEN. Recent reports have outlined some aspects of PTEN function in central nervous system development. Using a conditional gene disruption approach, we inactivated Pten in mice early during embryogenesis locally in a region specific fashion and later during postnatal development in a cell-specific manner, to study the role of PTEN in differentiation, migration and neoplastic transformation. We show that PTEN is required for the realisation of normal cerebellar architecture, for regulation of cell and organ size, and for proper neuronal and glial migration. However, PTEN is not required for cell differentiation and lack of PTEN is not sufficient to induce neoplastic transformation of neuronal or glial cells
CLC channels are a gene family of Cl(-) channels that serve a variety of functions, several of which are involved in genetic diseases. Few specific ligands of CLC channels are known that could be useful as pharmacological tools or potential drugs. We synthesized various derivatives of 2-(p-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid, the S(-)-enantiomer of which is a specific blocker of the muscle channel CLC-1. In particular, compounds with different alkyl or phenoxy-alkyl groups on the chiral center, isosteres of the oxygen in the aryloxy moiety, or bioisosteres of the carboxy function were prepared. We found that compounds containing a phenoxy and a phenoxy-alkyl group on the chiral center (bis-phenoxy derivatives) specifically inhibited renal CLC-K channels from the extracellular side with an affinity in the 150-microM range and with almost no effect on other CLC channels when applied from the outside. Surprisingly, the same substances inhibited CLC-1 from the intracellular side in a voltage-dependent manner with an apparent K(D) of <5 microM at -140 mV, thus being the most potent blockers of a CLC channel known so far. Although the chlorine atom in para- position of the second phenoxy group was essential for inhibition of CLC-K channels from the outside, it could be substituted by a methoxy group without changing the potency of block for CLC-1 from the inside. These newly identified substances provide powerful tools for studying the structure-function relationship and the physiological role of CLC channels and may represent a starting point for the development of useful drugs targeting CLC-K channels.
CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of endogenous steroids, and an allelic variant, CYP3A4*1B, consisting of an A to G polymorphism within the 5'-flanking region termed the nifedipine-specific response element (NFSE) has been associated with high grade and advanced stage of prostate cancers. Because steroid hormone exposure is known to influence breast and ovarian cancer risk, we conducted case-control studies to assess the relationship between CYP3A4*1B and risk of breast or ovarian cancer. CYP3A4 NFSE genotype was determined in 951 breast cancer cases and 500 controls frequency matched for age and 488 ovarian cancer cases and 276 controls of similar age distribution. Case-control analyses and comparisons of genotype distributions were conducted by unconditional logistic regression. In addition, the functional significance of the CYP3A4*1B polymorphism was assessed by analysis of CYP3A4-reporter gene constructs transiently transfected into liver-derived cell lines and primary cultures of well-differentiated rat hepatocytes. The GG genotype was rare in all groups (0-0.4%). There was no risk of cancer associated with the AG/GG genotypes combined, with an OR (95% CI) of 0.86 (0.54-1.33) for breast cancer (P = 0.5), and 1.51 (0.80-2.89) for ovarian cancer (P = 0.2). Analysis of CYP3A4-luciferase constructs showed that CYP3A4*1B did not consistently affect reporter gene activity. Our data suggest that the CYP3A4*1B polymorphism is not associated with risk of breast or ovarian cancer. In support of this negative finding, in-vitro functional studies indicate that NFSE genotype is not a critical factor in the transcriptional activity of the CYP3A4 5'-flanking region, and is thus unlikely to modulate CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of steroids.
ACE inhibitors are standard therapy for treating both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction. However, recent clinical trials have shown that beta blockers further reduce mortality in patients with symptomatic heart failure treated with ACE inhibitors. However, the evidence in support of adding beta blockers to ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction is less certain. The mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors and beta blockers may exert benefit in patients with heart failure are discussed, and studies assessing the association of beta blockade with outcome in patients with mild heart failure receiving ACE inhibitor therapy are reviewed.

CD36 expressed on adipocytes is thought to function as a fatty acid transporter (FAT). Here we report that adipocytes can endocytose and lysosomally degrade OxLDL, mainly mediated by CD36. Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes showed marked increase in uptake and degradation of (125)I-OxLDL during their differentiation to adipocytes. RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis indicated that expression of CD36 but not of scavenger receptor class A or macrosialin is required for the increase in uptake and degradation of (125)I-OxLDL in 3T3-L1 cells. An anti-CD36 antibody inhibited both uptake and degradation activities of (125)I-OxLDL up to 60%. These results strongly suggest that adipocytes may function as phagocytes like macrophages and that CD36 plays a novel role in adipose tissues.
ACE inhibition protects the heart against ischemic injury by reducing angiotensin II and promoting bradykinin (BK) accumulation. Since neutral endopeptidase (NEP) metabolizes BK, we determined its activity after induction of myocardial infarction (MI) and examined whether it is influenced by treatment with an ACE inhibitor or AT1 receptor blocker. Rats were studied 6 days and 3 wk after coronary occlusion. Starting 48 h after MI induction, additional animals were treated with the ACE inhibitor quinapril (2 mg x kg(-1) x day-1) or the AT1 blocker irbesartan (50 mg x kg(-1) x day-1). Animals were hemodynamically characterized. Finally, NEP-specific activity and BK concentrations were detected in homogenates of heart compartments. Quinapril and irbesartan treatment improved left ventricular function 6 days and 3 wk after MI induction, and NEP activity was elevated only in the infarcted area of untreated compared with sham-operated rats. After 6 days, irbesartan reversed this increase by 80% and quinapril by 35%. Quinapril had no effect after 3 wk, whereas irbesartan almost completely blocked the increased NEP activity in the infarcted area and concomitantly induced a further rise in the BK concentrations. These results indicate mechanisms of NEP regulation influenced by the AT1 receptor. Our data suggest that NEP is more decisive than ACE in mediating BK degradation and may indicate BK involvement in the cardioprotective effects of AT1 antagonists.
"PDE3A cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases regulate cAMP- and cGMP-mediated intracellular signaling in cardiac myocytes. We used antibodies to different regions of PDE3A to demonstrate the presence of three PDE3A isoforms in these cells. These isoforms, whose apparent molecular weights are 136,000, 118,000, and 94,000 (""PDE3A-136,"" ""PDE3A-118,"" and ""PDE3A-94""), are identical save for the deletion of different lengths of N-terminal sequence containing two membrane-association domains and sites for phosphorylation/activation by protein kinase B (""PK-B"") and protein kinase A (""PK-A""). PDE3A-136 contains both membrane-association domains and the PK-B and PK-A sites. PDE3A-118 contains only the downstream membrane-association domain and the PK-A sites. PDE3A-94 lacks both membrane localization domains and the PK-B and PK-A sites. The three isoforms are translated from two mRNAs derived from the PDE3A1 gene: PDE3A-136 is translated from PDE3A1 mRNA, whereas PDE3A-118 and PDE3A-94 are translated from PDE3A2 mRNA. Experiments involving in vitro transcription/translation indicate that PDE3A-118 and PDE3A-94 may be translated from different AUGs in PDE3A2 mRNA. These findings suggest that alternative transcriptional and post-transcriptional processing of the PDE3A gene results in the generation of two mRNAs and three protein isoforms in cardiac myocytes that differ with respect to intracellular localization and may be regulated through different signaling pathways."
CLC chloride channels form a large gene family that is found in bacteria, archae and eukaryotes. Previous mutagenesis studies on CLC chloride channels, combined with electrophysiology, strongly supported the theory that these channels form a homodimeric structure with one pore per subunit (a'double-barrelled' channel), and also provided clues about gating and permeation. Recently, the crystal structures of two bacterial CLC proteins have been obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis. They confirm the double-barrelled architecture, and reveal a surprisingly complex and unprecedented channel structure. At its binding site in the pore, chloride interacts with the ends of four helices that come from both sides of the membrane. A glutamate residue that protrudes into the pore is proposed to participate in gating. The structure confirms several previous conclusions from mutagenesis studies and provides an excellent framework for their interpretation.
PTEN on 10q23.3 encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase that negatively regulates the phosphoinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway and mediates cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Germline PTEN mutations cause Cowden syndrome and a range of several different hamartoma-tumor syndromes. Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome is characterized by germline mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes and by microsatellite instability (MSI) in component tumors. Although both colorectal carcinoma and endometrial carcinoma are the most frequent component cancers in HNPCC, only endometrial cancer has been shown to be a minor component of Cowden syndrome. We have demonstrated that somatic inactivation of PTEN is involved in both sporadic endometrial cancers and HNPCC-related endometrial cancers but with different mutational spectra and different relationships to MSI. In the current study, we sought to determine the relationship of PTEN mutation, 10q23 loss of heterozygosity, PTEN expression, and MSI status in colorectal cancers (CRCs). Among 11 HNPCC CRCs, 32 MSI+ sporadic cancers, and 39 MSI- tumors, loss of heterozygosity at 10q23.3 was found in 0%, 8%, and 19%, respectively. Somatic mutations were found in 18% (2 of 11) of the HNPCC CRCs and 13% (4 of 32) of the MSI+ sporadic tumors, but not in MSI- cancers (P = 0.015). All somatic mutations occurred in the two 6(A) coding mononucleotide tracts in PTEN, suggestive of the etiological role of the deficient MMR. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed 31% (14 of 45) of the HNPCC CRCs and 41% (9 of 22) of the MSI+ sporadic tumors with absent or depressed PTEN expression. Approximately 17% (4 of 23) of the MSI- CRCs had decreased PTEN expression, and no MSI- tumor had complete loss of PTEN expression. Among the five HNPCC or MSI+ sporadic CRCs carrying frameshift somatic mutations with immunohistochemistry data, three had lost all PTEN expression, one showed weak PTEN expression levels, and one had mixed tumor cell populations with weak and moderate expression levels. These results suggest that PTEN frameshift mutations in HNPCC and sporadic MSI+ tumors are a consequence of mismatch repair deficiency. Further, hemizygous deletions in MSI- CRCs lead to loss or reduction of PTEN protein levels and contribute to tumor progression. Finally, our data also suggest that epigenetic inactivation of PTEN, including differential subcellular compartmentalization, occurs in CRCs.
PTEN tumor suppressor is frequently mutated in human cancers, including breast cancers. Female patients with inherited PTEN mutations suffer from virginal hypertrophy of the breast with high risk of malignant transformation. However, the exact mechanisms of PTEN in controlling mammary gland development and tumorigenesis are unclear. In this study, we generated mice with a mammary-specific deletion of the Pten gene. Mutant mammary tissue displayed precocious lobulo-alveolar development, excessive ductal branching, delayed involution and severely reduced apoptosis. Pten null mammary epithelial cells were disregulated and hyperproliferative. Mutant females developed mammary tumors early in life. Similar phenotypes were observed in Pten-null mammary epithelia that had been transplanted into wild-type stroma, suggesting that PTEN plays an essential and cell-autonomous role in controlling the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells.
CYP3A4 is the most abundant cytochrome P450 (P450) in human liver, comprising approximately 30% of the total liver P450 content. This enzyme has an important role in steroid catabolism and metabolism of foreign compounds, with the majority of pharmaceutical compounds being substrates for CYP3A4. The molecular mechanisms that underlie transcriptional activation of CYP3A4 are complex with many steroid hormone nuclear receptors, including glucocorticoid receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR), vitamin D receptor, and constitutive androstane receptor, playing roles. Nowhere is this more evident than in the induction of CYP3A4 gene expression by glucocorticoids. CYP3A genes lack a consensus glucocorticoid receptor response element and yet are highly induced by classical glucocorticoids such as hydrocortisone and dexamethasone. Recent evidence has demonstrated that glucocorticoids are ligands for the orphan nuclear receptor PXR, and induction of CYP3A genes by glucocorticoids may occur primarily through PXR interactions. In this paper, we present a mutant that disrupts a hepatocyte-nuclear-factor-3/CCAAT-enhancer binding protein alpha binding site in the CYP3A4 proximal promoter. This mutation disrupts induction of a reporter gene construct by the glucocorticoids dexamethasone and hydrocortisone; yet induction by the potent PXR ligand rifampicin is unaffected. Such data provides strong evidence that glucocorticoids induce CYP3A4 gene expression both through the established PXR-dependent pathway but also through a PXR-independent pathway.
CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus express various types of serotonin (5-HT) receptors, such as 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(4) and 5-HT(7) receptors, which couple to Galpha(i) or Galpha(s) proteins and operate on different intracellular signalling pathways. In the present paper we verify such differential serotonergic modulation for the hyperpolarization-activated current I(h). Activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors induced an augmentation of current-induced hyperpolarization responses, while the responses declined after 5-HT(4) receptors were activated. The resting potential of neurons hyperpolarized (-2.3 +/- 0.7 mV) after 5-HT(1A) receptor activation, activation of 5-HT(4) receptors depolarized neurons (+3.3 +/- 1.4 mV). Direct activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) by forskolin also produced a depolarization. In voltage clamp, the Ih current was identified by its characteristic voltage- and time-dependency and by blockade with CsCl or ZD7288. Activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors reduced I(h) and shifted the activation curve to a more negative voltage by -5 mV at half-maximal activation. Activation of 5-HT(4) and 5-HT(7) receptors increased I(h) and shifted the activation curve to the right by +5 mV. Specific activation of 5-HT(4) receptors by BIMU8 increased membrane conductance and showed an increase in I(h) in a subset of cells, but did not induce a significant alteration in the activation curve. In order to verify spatial differences, we applied BIMU8 selectively to the soma and to the dendrites. Only somatic application induced receptor activation. These data are confirmed by immunofluorescence stainings with an antibody against the 5-HT(4) receptor, revealing receptor expression at the somata of the CA1 region. A similar expression pattern was found with a new antibody against 5-HT(7) receptors which reveals immunofluorescence staining on the cell bodies of pyramidal neurons.
CYP2A6 is known as an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of several clincally used drugs such as tegafur. Previously, we found two novel genotypes of the CYP2A6 gene, D-type and E-type, and the E-type was clarified to be homozygous for the CYP2A6*4A allele. On the other hand, since the D-type was reported to lack regions from at least intron 5 to a part of exon 9 of the CYP2A6 gene, it caused a misunderstanding that the D-type would be a partial CYP2A6 gene-deleted allele. In this paper, we demonstrate that the D-type is a genotype heterozygous for the CYP2A6*4A and another novel entire CYP2A6 gene-deleted allele, CYP2A6*4B, by analyzing a Japanese family including parents genotyped as the CYP2A6*4A/4A and CYP2A6*1A/*4B, respectively.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor that primarily dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate to down-regulate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Although the cellular functions of PTEN as a tumor suppressor have been well characterized, the mechanism by which PTEN activity is modulated by other signal molecules in vivo remains poorly understood. In searching for potential PTEN modulators through protein-protein interaction, we identified the major vault protein (MVP) as a dominant PTEN-binding protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. MVP is the major structural component of vault, the largest intracellular ribonucleoprotein particle. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the interaction between PTEN and MVP in transfected mammalian cells. More importantly, we found that a significant portion of endogenous PTEN associates with vault particles in human HeLa cells. Deletion mutation analysis demonstrated that MVP binds to the C2 domain of PTEN and that PTEN interacts with MVP through its EF hand-like motif. Furthermore, the in vitro binding experiments revealed that the interaction of PTEN with MVP is Ca(2+)-dependent.
SCD5 was identified as a multicopy suppressor of clathrin HC-deficient yeast. SCD5 is essential, but an scd5-Delta338 mutant, expressing Scd5p with a C-terminal truncation of 338 amino acids, is temperature sensitive for growth. Further studies here demonstrate that scd5-Delta338 affects receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis and normal actin organization. The scd5-Delta338 mutant contains larger and depolarized cortical actin patches and a prevalence of G-actin bars. scd5-Delta338 also displays synthetic negative genetic interactions with mutations in several other proteins important for cortical actin organization and endocytosis. Moreover, Scd5p colocalizes with cortical actin. Analysis has revealed that clathrin-deficient yeast also have a major defect in cortical actin organization and accumulate G-actin. Overexpression of SCD5 partially suppresses the actin defect of clathrin mutants, whereas combining scd5-Delta338 with a clathrin mutation exacerbates the actin and endocytic phenotypes. Both Scd5p and yeast clathrin physically associate with Sla2p, a homologue of the mammalian huntingtin interacting protein HIP1 and the related HIP1R. Furthermore, Sla2p localization at the cell cortex is dependent on Scd5p and clathrin function. Therefore, Scd5p and clathrin are important for actin organization and endocytosis, and Sla2p may provide a critical link between clathrin and the actin cytoskeleton in yeast, similar to HIP1(R) in animal cells.
CYP1A2 is a cytochrome P450 gene that is involved in human physiological responses to a variety of drugs and toxins. To investigate the role of population history and natural selection in shaping genetic diversity in CYP1A2, we sequenced a 3.7-kb region 5' from CYP1A2 in a diverse collection of 113 individuals from three major continental regions of the Old World (Africa, Asia, and Europe). We also examined sequences in the 90-member National Institutes of Health DNA Polymorphism Discovery Resource (PDR). Eighteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found. Most of the high-frequency SNPs found in the Old World sample were also found in the PDR sample. However, six SNPs were detected in the Old World sample but not in the PDR sample, and two SNPs found in the PDR sample were not found in the Old World sample. Most pairs of SNPs were in complete linkage disequilibrium with one another, and there was no indication of a decline of disequilibrium with physical distance in this region. The average +/- SD nucleotide diversity in the Old World sample was 0.00043+/-0.00026. The African population had the highest level of nucleotide diversity and the lowest level of linkage disequilibrium. Two distinct haplotype clusters with broadly overlapping geographical distributions were present. Of the 17 haplotypes found in the Old World sample, 12 were found in the African sample, 8 were found in Indians, 5 were found in non-Indian Asians, and 5 were found in Europeans. Haplotypes found outside Africa were mostly a subset of those found within Africa. These patterns are all consistent with an African origin of modern humans. Seven SNPs were singletons, and the site-frequency spectrum showed a significant departure from neutral expectations, suggesting population expansion and/or natural selection. Comparison with outgroup species showed that four derived SNPs have achieved high (>0.90) frequencies in human populations, a trend consistent with the action of positive natural selection. These patterns have a number of implications for disease-association studies in CYP1A2 and other genes.
GAD2 maps to chromosome 10p11.23 and encodes the 65-kDa isoform of GAD65, a major autoantigen in type 1 diabetes. The genetic variation that influences expression of preproinsulin mRNA, encoding another major autoantigen in type 1 diabetes, has already been shown to be genetically associated with disease. Previous reports that have assessed the association of GAD2 with type 1 diabetes have not used a dense map of markers surrounding the gene and have relied on very small clinical sample sizes. Consequently, no definite conclusions can be drawn from their negative results. We have therefore systematically searched all exons, the 3' untranslated region (UTR), the 5' UTR, and the 5' upstream region of GAD2, for polymorphisms in 32 white European individuals. We have genotyped these polymorphisms in a maximum of 472 U.K. type 1 diabetic affected sib pair families exhibiting linkage to type 1 diabetes on chromosome 10p and have tested both single variants and haplotypes in the GAD2 region for association with disease. We subsequently followed up our results by genotyping a subset of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a maximum of 873 Finnish families with at least one affected child. Our results suggest that GAD2 does not play a major role in type 1 diabetes in these two European populations.
ABO blood group matching policy between donor and recipient is a key element of organ allocation. Unequal distribution of the ABO blood groups in the population can lead to inequities in the distribution of organs to potential recipients. Furthermore, High Urgency liver transplant candidates might compromise the chances of transplantation for the elective patients. To compare the influence of the various ABO blood group matching policies on the transplantation rate of HU patients and on the subsequent donor liver availability for elective patients, a simulation study was undertaken. The study shows that in the Eurotransplant liver allocation program, a restricted ABO-compatible matching policy for HU liver patients offers the highest probability of acquiring a liver transplant, for both High Urgency- and elective patients, irrespective of their ABO blood group. A simulation study once again proved to be an elegant tool for objectively analysing various options in a complex organ allocation algorithm.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a dual phosphatase protein capable of modulating membrane receptors and interaction of the cell and extracellular stimuli. PTEN regulates cell physiology such as division, differentiation/apoptosis and also migration and adhesion. The expression of PTEN was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in OSCC and compared to a well-established histological malignancy grading system. The well-differentiated OSCC were 59.1% and poorly differentiated were 40.9%. According to PTEN expression, the cases were 45.5% positive (the entire tumor showed stained), 22.7% mixed (both negative and positive cells were present) and 31.8% negative (no staining was seen in the tumor cells). PTEN expression in OSCC was related to the malignancy grade (P < 0.0005). Aggressive tumors with a high score of malignancy did not express PTEN, and clearly, the PTEN expression was present in the epithelium adjacent to the tumor. Negative cells were in the invasion border of the tumor. This result suggests that PTEN is related to histologic pattern and biological behavior of OSCC and may be a used as a prognostic marker in the future. The role of PTEN during carcinogenesis and as a biomarker should be further investigated.
CYP1A1 is largely involved in carcinogenesis through the bioactivation of numerous procarcinogens. Exposure to environmental pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) leads to induction of CYP1A1 via AhR pathway. We have previously demonstrated that fetal bovine serum (FBS) induces CYP1A1 gene transcription. In this work, we show evidence that the serum does not contain an AhR ligand and we evaluated the effect of a 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) and FBS cotreatment on CYP1A1 expression. CYP1A1 activity was potentiated by this treatment. This potentiation was at least in part associated with an increase of the CYP1A1 mRNA and gene transcription levels. FBS potentiation of CYP1A1 PAH-mediated induction was related to a significant increase of single strand breaks of DNA as compared to a single 3-MC treatment. Moreover, we demonstrated that human serum induces CYP1A1 with a high interindividual variability. The potentiation by serum of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon CYP1A1 induction could be involved in the etiology of some human cancers.
AQP3 is a water and glycerol channel present on human erythrocytes and in various tissues. By protein and molecular biology analysis, two unrelated probands who developed alloantibodies to the high frequency antigen GIL were found to be AQP3-deficient. The defect is caused by homozygous mutation affecting the 5' donor splice site of intron 5 of the AQP3 gene. This mutation causes the skipping of exon 5 and generates a frameshift and premature stop codon. Functional studies by 90 degrees light scattering using a stopped-flow spectrometer revealed the absence of facilitated glycerol transport across red cell membranes from the probands, but the water and urea transports were normal. Expression studies into COS-7 cells followed by flow cytometry analysis showed that only cells transfected with AQP3 cDNA strongly reacted with anti-GIL antibodies. These findings represent the first reported cases of AQP3 deficiency in humans and provide the molecular basis of a new blood group system, GIL, encoded by the AQP3 protein.
EXT1 and EXT2 are genes that have been shown to cause hereditary multiple exostosis (HME), a syndrome marked by the formation of bony growths juxtaposed to the growth plate. These genes are members of a growing family of proteins with glycosyltransferase activity required for the synthesis of heparan sulfate chains. This protein activity is predicted to play a role in the expression of proteoglycans on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. We and others have previously suggested that a two-hit mutational model applies to the development of an exostosis where a germline mutation coupled with a somatic mutation results in the loss of EXT1 or EXT2 function and subsequent tumor formation. We report the direct sequencing and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of 12 exostoses from 10 HME families, 4 solitary exostoses, and their corresponding constitutional DNA. Of the 16 exostoses screened, we find only one solitary case in which two somatic mutations, a deletion and an LOH, are present. This provides limited support for the two-hit hypothesis involving the EXT1 and EXT2 genes for the development of an exostosis. Alternative models are developed based on the functional significance of EXT proteins in heparan sulfate biosynthesis.
ACE inhibitors attenuate the detrimental effects of angiotensin II, and improve survival and reduce morbidity in patients with acute myocardial infarction and evidence of heart failure or left-ventricular dysfunction. Selective antagonism of the angiotensin type 1 receptor represents an alternative approach to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. We did a multicentre, randomised trial to test the hypothesis that the angiotensin II antagonist losartan would be superior or non-inferior to the ACE inhibitor captopril in decreasing all-cause mortality in high-risk patients after acute myocardial infarction.
ABCA1 is an ATP binding cassette transporter that plays an essential role in cholesterol and phospholipid efflux and HDL biogenesis. ABCA1 expression in macrophage cells is subject to regulation by cAMP, cholesterol loading, and ligands of the nuclear receptors liver X receptor (LXR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR). We report here the development of a rapid and high volume branched DNA (bDNA) method to measure ABCA1 mRNA. By using the bDNA method, we show that both LXR and RXR ligands effectively regulate ABCA1 expression in three macrophage cell types: mouse RAW264.7 cell line, mouse peritoneal macrophage cells, and human macrophage THP-1 cells and their regulation is additive. Furthermore, by using a radiolabeled cholesterol efflux assay, we show that both LXR and RXR ligands are sufficient to mediate cholesterol efflux in macrophage cells and their efficacy correlates with ABCA1 regulation. These studies strengthen further the notion that LXR and RXR mediate ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux in macrophage cells as a permissive heterodimer and development of small molecule ligands of these nuclear receptors may represent a promising approach to modulating cholesterol efflux and plasma HDL cholesterol level in humans.
ABCA1 on the cell surface and in endosomes plays an essential role in the cell-mediated lipidation of apoA-I to form nascent HDL. Our previous studies of transgenic mice overexpressing ABCA1 suggested that ABCA1 in the liver plays a major role in regulating plasma HDL levels. The site of function of ABCA1 in the polarized hepatocyte was currently assessed by expression of an adenoviral construct encoding a human ABCA1-GFP fusion protein in the polarized hepatocyte-like WIF-B cell line. Consistent with localization of ABCA1 at the basolateral (vascular) cell surface, expression of ABCA1-GFP stimulated apoA-I mediated efflux of WIF-B cell cholesterol into the culture medium. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that ABCA1-GFP was expressed solely on the basolateral surface and associated endocytic vesicles. These findings suggest an important role for hepatocyte basolateral membrane ABCA1 in the regulation of the levels of intracellular hepatic cholesterol, as well as plasma HDL.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in embryonic development, intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation, and tumor suppression. The transcription factor Cdx-2 is critical in intestinal development and homeostasis, and its expression is altered in colorectal cancers. However, the regulation of the Cdx-2 gene has not been entirely elucidated. Here, we hypothesize that Cdx-2 may be a target of PTEN signaling in the intestine.
ACE inhibitors and beta blockers have reduced morbidity and mortality from chronic heart failure significantly during the last years. Apart from medical therapy several surgical strategies for the treatment of heart failure are available.
NQO1 (DT-diaphorase) and its truncated isoenzyme, the metalloenzyme NQO2, can reduce quinone substrates by two-electron transfer. While NQO1 is a known detoxification enzyme, the function of NQO2 is less well understood. Both rat NQO1 and human NQO2 reductively bioactivate the dinitroarene CB 1954 to a cytotoxic product that behaves as a difunctional DNA-crosslinking species with potent anti-tumour activity, although human NQO1 is much less effective. A FMN-dependent nitroreductase from E. coli B also reduces quinones and reductively bioactivates CB 1954. However, this enzyme reduces CB 1954 to the 2- and 4-hydroxylamines in equivalent yield, whereas NQO1 and NQO2 generate only the 4-isomer. The reduction profile is a key factor in the development of anti-tumour prodrugs, where distinct delivery strategies are being evaluated: prodrug therapy, antibody-, macromolecule and gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT, MDEPT or GDEPT). The flavoprotein enzymes are explored in terms of structure and bioreduction mechanism, particularly for use in the design of novel prodrugs with potential application as chemotherapeutic agents.
NQO1 gene expression was evaluated by RT-PCR and SNP status by RFLP in matched samples of lung tumors and adjacent normal tissue. NQO1 was found to be overexpressed in lung tumors when compared to matched normal lung tissue. The mean expression in normal lung tissue was 28.26 x 10(-14) ng/microl +/- 44.9 SD and 61.46 x 10(-14) ng/microl +/- 103.2 SD in lung tumors. NQO1 gene expression was higher in the tumor than in the matched normal lung tissue in 27/50 (59%) patients (p=0.014). In the normal samples, 25 (50%) were wild-type, 16 were heterozygotes (32%) and 8 had the SNP (16%). In the matched tumor samples 14 were wild-type (28%), 16 were heterozygous (32%) and 19 (38%) had the SNP (p=0.0043). The genomic NQO1 mutation was associated with survival in a pilot study of stage II/III NSCLC patients. Patients with a homozygous SNP genotype had a significantly shorter survival (median 12 months), than heterozygous or homozygous wild-type patients (median 41 months) (p=0.007), suggesting NQO1 may be important in chemosensitivity as well as the pathogenesis of lung cancer and NQO1 genotyping may be a useful component of pharmacogenetic strategies for the treatment of NSCLC.
CYP1A2 is one of the major hepatic cytochrome P450s that is involved in the metabolism of many drugs, as well as in the activation of chemical carcinogens. To elucidate the transcriptional regulation of the constitutive expression of the mouse Cypla2 gene, the 4.8-kbp 5(')-flanking region of the gene was analyzed for transcriptional activity using a primary cultured mouse hepatocyte system. With 5(')- and 3(')-deletion analysis, two enhancer elements, i.e., a 20-bp DNA fragment (E1) from -4401 to -4382 and a 9-bp (E2) from -4300 to -4292, were identified. E1 and E2 contain a phorbol 12-O-tetradecanoate-13-acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE) and TRE-like element, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed specific binding between these two enhancer elements and nuclear proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis assay suggested that the TRE element in E1 is essential for constitutive expression of the mouse Cypla2 gene.
ACE inhibition reduces morbidity and mortality among a variety of patients. Among mechanisms explaining these beneficial effects are the effects on the sympathetic system and on local vasodilating substances such as nitric oxide and bradykinins at the level of the endothelium. The PERFECT study was designed to verify the above mentioned pathophysiological concepts.
CYP2D6 is a polymorphic enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of various drugs. At least 40-mutant alleles of CYP2D6 have been reported. CYP2D6*14, which is one of them found in Asian populations, causes deficient activity of CYP2D6. Four amino acid substitutions, P34S, G169R, R296C, and S486T, are present in the protein encoded by CYP2D6*14 (CYP2D6 14). Among them, G169R is thought to be a definitive substitution because it is unique to CYP2D6 14. However, a previous study showed that the activity of G169R-substituted CYP2D6 was about 40% of wild-type CYP2D6, suggesting that a combination of G169R and other substitutions may be required to abolish the activity of CYP2D6. In the present study, we examined the effects of combined substitutions of G169R and P34S on the functional properties of CYP2D6 and compared them with those of a single substitution of G169R or P34S using a cDNA expression system of V79 cells. The results showed that a combined substitution of G169R and P34S reduced the activities of CYP2D6 to less than the detection limit of our analytical method for bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation. However, these activities were not completely abolished by a single substitution of P34S or G169R. The findings suggest that simultaneous substitution of G169R and P34S is crucial for almost completely abolishing the activity of CYP2D6 at least in V79 cells, although whether the absence of metabolism is due to the absence of functional protein or catalytic incompetency remains unclear because the levels of CYP2D6 protein expressed in V79 cells were too low to be determined by difference CO-reduced spectra.
ACE inhibitors delay the progression from incipient to overt diabetic nephropathy and reduce albumin excretion rate (AER), independently of blood pressure. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists produce similar effects on microalbuminuria and mean arterial pressure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of irbesartan on microalbuminuria and blood pressure in hypertensive and normotensive type 2 diabetic patients.
CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed in many tissues throughout the body. In addition to its major NAD+-glycohydrolase activity, CD38 is also able to synthesize cyclic ADP-ribose, an endogenous calcium-regulating molecule, from NAD+. In the present study, we have compared ADP-ribosyl cyclase and NAD+-glycohydrolase activities in protein extracts of brains from developing and adult wild-type and Cd38 -/- mice. In extracts from wild-type brain, cyclase activity was detected spectrofluorimetrically, using nicotinamide-guanine dinucleotide as a substrate (GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity), as early as embryonic day 15. The level of cyclase activity was similar in the neonate brain (postnatal day 1) and then increased greatly in the adult brain. Using [14C]NAD+ as a substrate and HPLC analysis, we found that ADP-ribose is the major product formed in the brain at all developmental stages. Under the same experimental conditions, neither NAD+-glycohydrolase nor GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity could be detected in extracts of brains from developing or adult Cd38 -/- mice, demonstrating that CD38 is the predominant constitutive enzyme endowed with these activities in brain at all developmental stages. The activity measurements correlated with the level of CD38 transcripts present in the brains of developing and adult wild-type mice. Using confocal microscopy we showed, in primary cultures of hippocampal cells, that CD38 is expressed by both neurons and glial cells, and is enriched in neuronal perikarya. Intracellular NAD+-glycohydrolase activity was measured in hippocampal cell cultures, and CD38-dependent cyclase activity was higher in brain fractions enriched in intracellular membranes. Taken together, these results lead us to speculate that CD38 might have an intracellular location in neural cells in addition to its plasma membrane location, and may play an important role in intracellular cyclic ADP-ribose-mediated calcium signalling in brain tissue.
PTEN is a recently identified tumour suppressor inactivated in a wide variety of human cancers, including endometrial cancers. Mutation of the PTEN tumour suppressor gene has been reported in approximately 50-83% of endometrial adenocarcinoma. Despite this fact, study of the expression of PTEN protein in human tumours is limited. PTEN protein functions as a tumour suppressor by regulating the cell cycle and survival through signal transduction pathway. PTEN protein was considered to have a dual-specificity phosphatase activity, but it is now known that its principal physiological activity is mainly derived from its lipid phosphatase activity. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27, has been suggested as a downstream target of cell cycle arrest of PTEN in various in vitro studies. In this study, we evaluated the alteration of PTEN protein expression in endometrial carcinoma and assessed its relationship to the expression of p27, the presumed downstream target of PTEN.
MPO participates in the metabolic activation of tobacco carcinogens such as PAHs. A frequent MPO -463 G-->A polymorphism in the promoter region reduces MPO transcription and has been correlated with >4-fold lower benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adduct levels in the skin of coal tar-treated patients. Four of 7 case-control studies found significantly reduced lung cancer risk associated with the A allele. Due to their different etiologies, we examined whether the MPO genotype affects histologic lung cancer types differentially. A case-control study was conducted in 625 ever-smoking lung cancer patients, including 228 adenocarcinomas, 224 SCCs, 135 SCLCs and 340 ever-smoking hospital controls. MPO genotyping was performed by capillary PCR followed by fluorescence-based melting curve analysis. Combining the MPO -463 (G/A+A/A) genotypes, a protective effect approaching significance (OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.55-1.01) was observed when comparing all lung cancer cases to controls. Among histologic types of lung cancer, a weak protective effect was found for both adenocarcinoma (OR = 0.81, CI 0.55-1.19) and SCC (OR = 0.82, CI 0.56-1.21); a stronger and significant effect was found for SCLC (OR = 0.58, CI 0.36-0.95; p = 0.029). Our results also suggest that the MPO genotype varies among inflammatory nonmalignant lung diseases. In conclusion, our results emphasize the need for a separate analysis of lung cancer histologic types and an adjustment for inflammatory nonmalignant lung diseases in future MPO-related studies. We confirm that the MPO -463 A variant affords a protective effect against lung cancer risk in smokers, which was strongest for SCLC patients.
CYP2C9 is a polymorphic gene with at least six known allelic variants (CYP2C9*1 to *6). CYP2C9*5 has been recently described in African-Americans. The lower activity of CYP2C9*5 encoded enzyme than *1 has been reported for the S-warfarin 7-hydroxylation in vitro. The aim of the present study was to develop an assay for the analysis of this variant and to determine the frequency of this polymorphism in different ethnic populations.
PTEN gene is a newly discovered tumor suppressor gene, that maps to chromosome 10q23, and of longstanding interest to those studying somatic mutations in human tumors. Mutation and deletion of PTEN gene probably resulted in a new signal transduction pathway related to human malignant tumors. It was reported that PTEN gene mutated and deleted in renal cell carcinoma, however, there was no report concerning its expression in renal cell carcinoma. This study was designed to investigate expression and significance of PTEN gene in primary renal cell carcinoma.
ACE 2, a novel homologue of angiotensin converting enzyme, has recently been identified. This study used QRT-PCR to quantitatively map the transcriptional expression profile of ACE 2 (and the two isoforms of ACE) in 72 human tissues. While confirming that ACE 2 expression is high in renal and cardiovascular tissues, the novel observation has been made that ACE 2 shows comparably high levels of expression in the gastrointestinal system, in particular in ileum, duodenum, jejunum, caecum and colon. Therefore, in probing the functional significance of this novel peptidase, some consideration should be given to a role in gastrointestinal physiology and pathophysiology.
PTEN (also known as MMAC-1 or TEP-1) is a frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene in human cancer. PTEN functions have been identified in the regulation of cell survival, growth, adhesion, migration, and invasiveness. Here, we characterize the diverse signaling networks modulated by PTEN in osteoclast precursors stimulated by RANKL and osteopontin (OPN). RANKL dose-dependently stimulated transient activation of Akt before activation of PTEN, consistent with a role for PTEN in decreasing Akt activity. PTEN overexpression blocked RANKL-activated Akt stimulated survival and osteopontin-stimulated cell migration while a dominant-negative PTEN increased the actions of RANKL and OPN. PTEN overexpression suppressed RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation and OPN-stimulated cell migration. The PTEN dominant-negative constitutively induced osteoclast differentiation and cell migration. Our data demonstrate multiple roles for PTEN in RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and OPN-stimulated cell migration in RAW 264.7 osteoclast precursors.
CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein involved in signaling and adhesion which is expressed mainly by immature hematopoietic cells and activated lymphoid cells. Central lymphatic channels of human small intestinal villi, the so-called lacteals, were coincidentally found to express CD38. Gastric and large intestinal mucosae, pancreas, liver, lung, nasal mucosa, kidney, thymus, palatine tonsil, Peyer's patches, appendix, and mesenteric lymph nodes, and rodent intestinal mucosa were subsequently examined for lymphatic expression of CD38. Cryosections prepared from biopsy or surgical resection specimens were immunostained with four different antibodies to CD38 combined with antibodies to von Willebrand factor and CD31 to differentiate lymphatics from blood vessels, or with antibody to lysosomal protein. Sections were evaluated by ordinary and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Jejunal cryosections were subjected to in situ hybridization for CD38. All CD38 antibodies decorated human lacteals, and some of these were positive for CD38 mRNA. Lymphatics draining Peyer's patches and appendix as well as afferent lymphatics of mesenteric lymph nodes expressed CD38 weakly. CD38 was not detected on lymphatics in other organs or in rodent lacteals. We propose that CD38 is a novel marker of human small intestinal lymphatic vessels.
PHOSPHO1 is a recently identified phosphatase expressed at high levels in the chicken growth plate and which may be involved in generating inorganic phosphate for skeletal matrix mineralization. Using a degenerate RT-PCR approach a fragment of human PHOSPHO1 was cloned. This enabled the identification of the human orthologue on HSA17q21, and the mouse orthologue on a region of MMU11 that exhibits conservation of synteny with HSA17q21. Chicken PHOSPHO1 was mapped by SSCP analysis to position 44 cM on GGA27, adjacent to the HOXB@ (44 cM) and COL1A1 (36 cM) loci. Comparison of genes on GGA27 with their orthologues on the preliminary draft of the human genome identifies regions of conserved synteny equivalent to 25 Mb on HSA17q21.2-23.3 and approximately 20 Mb on GGA27 in which the gene order appears to be conserved. Mapping of the PHOSPHO1 genes to regions of HSA17q21.3, MMU11 and GGA27 that exhibit conservation of synteny provides strong evidence that they are orthologous.
CYP2C19 is a clinically important enzyme responsible for the metabolism of a number of therapeutic drugs, such as mephenytoin, omeprazole, diazepam, proguanil, propranolol and certain antidepressants. Genetic polymorphisms in this enzyme result in poor metabolizers of these drugs. There are racial differences in the incidence of the poor metabolizer trait, which represents 13-23% of Asians but only 3-5% of Caucasians. In this study, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP2C19 were identified by direct sequencing of genomic DNA from 92 individuals from three different racial groups of varied ethnic background, including Caucasians, Asians and blacks. Several new alleles were identified containing the coding changes Arg114 His (CYP2C19*9), Pro227 Leu (CYP2C19*10), Arg150 His (CYP2C19*11), stop491 Cys (CYP2C19*12), Arg410 Cys (CYP2C19*13), Leu17 Pro (CYP2C19*14) and Ile19 Leu (CYP2C19*15). When expressed in a bacterial cDNA expression system, CYP2C19*9 exhibited a modest decrease in the V(max) for 4'-hydroxylation of -mephenytoin, and no alteration in its affinity for reductase. CYP2C19*10 exhibited a dramatically higher K(m) and lower V(max) for mephenytoin. CYP2C19*12was unstable and expressed poorly in a bacterial cDNA expression system. Clinical studies will be required to confirm whether this allele is defective in vivo. CYP2C19*9, CYP2C19*10 and CYP2C19*12 all occurred in African-Americans, or individuals of African descent, and represent new potentially defective alleles of CYP2C19 which are predicted to alter risk of these populations to clinically important drugs.
ACE inhibition reduces plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a risk factor for myocardial infarction, whereas the effect of angiotensin receptor antagonism on PAI-1 is uncertain. The present study compares the time course of effects of ACE inhibition and angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonism on morning plasma PAI-1 antigen. Blood pressure and endocrine, metabolic, and fibrinolytic variables were measured in 20 insulin-resistant (defined by fasting glucose >8.3 mmol/L, body mass index >28 kg/m2, or fasting serum triglyceride > or =2.8 mmol/L) hypertensive subjects (mean age, 47.9+/-2.1 years) (1) before and after 1 week of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/d, and (2) before and 1, 3, 4, and 6 weeks after addition of ramipril (escalated to 10 mg/d) or losartan (escalated to 100 mg/d). Hydrochlorothiazide decreased systolic (P=0.011) and diastolic (P=0.019) pressure. Ramipril (from 133.6+/-5.1/94.5+/-2.4 to 127.0+/-3.1/91.4+/-3.3 mm Hg) or losartan (from 137.0+/-3.9/93.1+/-2.9 to 123.7+/-2.6/86.4+/-2.1 mm Hg) further reduced systolic (P=0.009) and diastolic (P=0.037) pressure. The pressure effects of the 2 drugs were similar. Hydrochlorothiazide increased plasma PAI-1 (P=0.013) but not tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) (P=0.431) antigen. Addition of either ramipril or losartan significantly decreased plasma PAI-1 antigen (P=0.046). However, the effect of losartan on PAI-1 antigen was not sustained throughout the 6-week treatment period, such that there was a significant drugxtime interaction (P=0.043). tPA antigen decreased during either ramipril or losartan (P=0.032), but tPA activity decreased only during losartan (P=0.018). Short-term interruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by either ACE inhibition or AT1 receptor antagonism decreases PAI-1 antigen, but the duration of this effect is greater for ACE inhibition than for AT1 receptor antagonism.
MTHFR is a critical enzyme that regulates the metabolism of folate and methionine, both of which are important factors in DNA methylation and synthesis. Subjects with the 677C-->T variant have impaired remethylation of Hcy to methionine that could determine hyperhomocysteinemia. Remethylation of Hcy into methionine and DNA methylation are also affected by MTX treatment. Thus, a combined effect between MTX and reduced activity of the MTHFR 677C-->T polymorphism could occur, leading to toxicity. In a clinical trial, 43 ovarian cancer patients were treated with low doses of MTX. During MTX therapy, 12 patients (27.9%) developed G3/4 WHO toxicity. In these 12 patients, we observed 6 G3/4 thrombocytopenias, 1 G3 neutropenia, 1 G3 anemia, 9 G3 mucositis cases and 1 G4 mucositis case. A significant association was observed between toxicity and TT MTHFR 677 genotype (p < 0.0001). G3/4 toxicity occurred in 10 of 13 (77%), 1 of 17 (6%) and 1 of 13 (8%) patients with the TT, CT and CC MTHFR genotypes, respectively. According to the logistic regression model, patients with the TT genotype had a relative risk of 42.0 (95% CI 4.2-418.6) of developing G3/4 toxicity compared to patients with the CC and CT genotypes. Patients with the TT genotype had Hcy plasma levels after MTX therapy significantly (p = 0.0001) higher than basal levels (mean +/- SD = 16.71 +/- 4.72 vs. 12.48 +/- 3.57 micromol/l); moreover, they also had higher Hcy plasma levels after MTX than patients with other MTHFR 677 genotypes (CC mean +/- SD = 9.87 +/- 3.61 micromol/l and CT mean +/- SD = 11.48 +/- 3.13 micromol/l). Finally, significant associations were observed between G3/4 WHO toxicity and higher Hcy plasma levels after MTX treatment (p = 0.0004). In conclusion, our data suggest that the TT MTHFR 677 genotype is associated with marked MTX-induced hyperhomocysteinemia and could represent a pharmacogenetic marker for toxicity after chronic treatment with low doses of MTX.
NSF and p97 are ATPases required for the heterotypic fusion of transport vesicles with their target membranes and the homotypic fusion of organelles. NSF uses ATP hydrolysis to dissociate NSF/SNAPs/SNAREs complexes, separating the v- and t-SNAREs, which are then primed for subsequent rounds of fusion. In contrast, p97 does not dissociate the p97/p47/SNARE complex even in the presence of ATP. Now we have identified a novel essential factor for p97/p47-mediated membrane fusion, named VCIP135 (valosin-containing protein [VCP][p97]/p47 complex-interacting protein, p135), and show that it binds to the p97/p47/syntaxin5 complex and dissociates it via p97 catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. In living cells, VCIP135 and p47 are shown to function in Golgi and ER assembly.
EBP is not a new concept. To practice using the newest and best research evidence, clinicians must have the knowledge and skills to find and appraise the quality of the evidence. This process starts with the formulation of a focused question, followed by an effective search for the best evidence, critical appraisal of the evidence retrieved, and integration of that best evidence into practice. There are an increasing number of resources that can provide clinicians with the best evidence and that can assist clinicians with enhancement of their EBP skills. Unique challenges exist in practicing in an evidence-based manner in the field of pediatric rehabilitation, but through the collaboration of clinicians and researchers, these challenges can be overcome.
CYP3A4 constitutes the major liver cytochrome P450 isoenzyme and is responsible for the oxidation of more than 50% of all known drugs. Human variability in kinetics for this pathway has been quantified using a database of 15 compounds metabolised extensively (>60%) by this CYP isoform in order to develop CYP3A4-related uncertainty factors for the risk assessment of environmental contaminants handled via this route. Data were analysed from published pharmacokinetic studies (after oral and intravenous dosing) in healthy adults and other subgroups using parameters relating primarily to chronic exposure [metabolic and total clearances, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)] and acute exposure (Cmax). Interindividual variability in kinetics was greater for the oral route (46%, 12 compounds) than for the intravenous route (32%, 14 compounds). The physiological and molecular basis for the difference between these two routes of exposure is discussed. In relation to the uncertainty factors used for risk assessment, the default kinetic factor of 3.16 would be adequate for adults, whereas a CYP3A4-related factor of 12 would be required to cover up to 99% of neonates, which have lower CYP3A4 activity.
ACE or kininase II inhibitors are very important, widely used therapeutic agents for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Although they inhibit ACE, thus, angiotensin II release and bradykinin (BK) inactivation, this inhibition alone does not suffice to explain their successful application in medical practice. Enalaprilat and other ACE inhibitors at nanomolar concentrations activate the BK B1 receptor directly in the absence of ACE and the peptide ligands, des-Arg-kinins. The inhibitors activate at the Zn-binding pentameric consensus sequence HEXXH (195 -199) of B1, a motif also present in the active centers of ACE but absent from the BK B2 receptor. ACE inhibitors, when activating the B1 receptor, elevate intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i and release NO from cultured cells. Activation by ACE inhibitor was abolished by Ca-EDTA, a B1 receptor antagonist, by a synthetic undecapeptide representing the 192-202 sequence in the B1 receptor, and by site-directed mutagenesis of H195 to A. With the exception of the B1 receptor blocker, these agents and the mutation did not affect the actions of the peptide ligand des-Arg10-Lys1-BK. Ischemia and inflammatory cytokines induce B1 receptors and elevate its expression. Direct activation of the B1 receptor by ACE inhibitors can contribute to their therapeutic efficacy, for example, by releasing NO in vascular beds, or to some of their side effects.
ATIC encompasses both AICAR transformylase and IMP cyclohydrolase activities that are responsible for the catalysis of the penultimate and final steps of the purine de novo synthesis pathway. The formyl transfer reaction catalyzed by the AICAR Tfase domain is substantially more demanding than that catalyzed by the other folate-dependent enzyme of the purine biosynthesis pathway, GAR transformylase. Identification of the AICAR Tfase active site and key catalytic residues is essential to elucidate how the non-nucleophilic AICAR amino group is activated for formyl transfer. Hence, the crystal structure of dimeric avian ATIC was determined as a complex with the AICAR Tfase substrate AICAR, as well as with an IMP cyclohydrolase inhibitor, XMP, to 1.93 A resolution. AICAR is bound at the dimer interface of the transformylase domains and forms an extensive hydrogen bonding network with a multitude of active site residues. The crystal structure suggests that the conformation of the 4-carboxamide of AICAR is poised to increase the nucleophilicity of the C5 amine, while proton abstraction occurs via His(268) concomitant with formyl transfer. Lys(267) is likely to be involved in the stabilization of the anionic formyl transfer transition state and in subsequent protonation of the THF leaving group.
ACE inhibitors are known to be effective in preventing the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is reported to contribute to intrarenal hemodynamic abnormality in diabetic patients. We examined whether RAS blockade by captopril induces intrarenal hemodynamic changes in normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes.
ABCA1 mediates release of cellular cholesterol and phospholipid to form high density lipoprotein (HDL). The three different mutants in the first extracellular domain of human ABCA1 associated with Tangier disease, R587W, W590S, and Q597R, were examined for their subcellular localization and function by using ABCA1-GFP fusion protein stably expressed in HEK293 cells. ABCA1-GFP expressed in HEK293 was fully functional for apoA-I-mediated HDL assembly. Immunostaining and confocal microscopic analyses demonstrated that ABCA1-GFP was mainly localized to the plasma membrane (PM) but also substantially in intracellular compartments. All three mutant ABCA1-GFPs showed no or little apoA-I-mediated HDL assembly. R587W and Q597R were associated with impaired processing of oligosaccharide from high mannose type to complex type and failed to be localized to the PM, whereas W590S did not show such dysfunctions. Vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping was examined to elucidate the mechanism for the dysfunction in the W590S mutant. Photoaffinity labeling of W590S with 8-azido-[alpha-(32)P]ATP was stimulated by adding ortho-vanadate in the presence of Mn(2+) as much as in the presence of wild-type ABCA1. These results suggest that the defect of HDL assembly in R587W and Q597R is due to the impaired localization to the PM, whereas W590S has a functional defect other than the initial ATP binding and hydrolysis.
CLC proteins are a nine-member gene family of Cl- channels that have diverse roles in the plasma membrane and in intracellular organelles. The recent structure determination of bacterial CLC homologues by Dutzler et al. was a breakthrough for the structure-function analysis of CLC channels. This review describes the mechanisms of inhibition of muscle type CLC channels by two classes of small organic substances: 9-anthracene carboxylic acid (9AC) and p-chlorophenoxy propionic acid (CPP). Both substances block muscle type CLC channels (CLC-0 and CLC-1) from the intracellular side. For CPP, one could show that it inhibits the individual protopores of the double-barrelled channel. A major difference between the two types of blockers is the extremely slow binding- and unbinding-kinetics of 9AC (time scale of min), compared to that of CPP block (time scale of s), while the general mechanism of block seems to be quite similar. In the case of the chiral CPP only the S(-) enantiomer is effective. Both substances exhibit a strongly voltage-dependent block with strong inhibition at negative voltages and relief of block at depolarizing potentials at which the channels tend to open maximally. A quantitative kinetic model was developed for the CPP block of CLC-0 in which the closed state has a much larger affinity for CPP than the open state and opening of drug-bound channels is greatly slowed compared to drug-free channels. First experiments with mutated CLC-0 channels and with derivatives of CPP strongly support the pore localization of the CPP binding site. This work provides the basis for the use of these small organic substances as tools to investigate the pharmacological properties of mammalian CLC channels guided by the crystallographic structure of bacterial CLC homologues. They might also turn out to be useful to obtain information about the intricate coupling of gating and permeation that characterizes CLC channels.
ABO incompatibility in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may be associated with incomplete or delayed erythroid engraftment, being pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) the most severe complication in this setting. Attempts for the treatment of PRCA have been made with erythropoietin or with plasmapheresis with relative success, and some authors have reported the reversibility of PRCA with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG or ATG), based on the assumption that PRCA might be immunologically mediated. We report herewith a patient with acute leukemia who developed post--BMT pure red cell aplasia. His sibling donor (sister) was HLA identical and ABO incompatible, having low agglutinin titers against donor's blood group. PRCA did not improve after treatment with erythropoietin or a boost of hematopoietic progenitor cells obtained from donor's peripheral blood but the problem was resolved completely after treatment with ALG.
CYP3A5 is the major CYP3A form in the human lung, and it is inducible by dexamethasone in the human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line. In the present study, we characterized the nature and mechanism of this induction process. The induction of CYP3A5 mRNA was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in A549 cells. About 4-fold induction was detected by nanomolar concentrations of dexamethasone and also by budenoside and beclomethasone dipropionate, glucocorticoids used for the inhalation treatment of bronchial asthma, whereas the CYP3A4 inducers mifepristone (RU486), rifampicin, clotrimazole, and nifedipine were without effect. The glucocorticoid induction was blocked by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU486. In transient transfection assays to A549 cells, CYP3A5 5' regulatory region was activated by the dexamethasone treatment. In contrast, dexamethasone was unable to induce CYP3A5 transcription in GR-deficient COS-1 cells, but the induction could be achieved after GR cotransfection. The CYP3A5 expression was measured in alveolar macrophages from patients with respiratory diseases. The CYP3A5 expression level was decreased by smoking, but glucocorticoid therapy had no statistically significant effect. In conclusion, CYP3A5 is induced in the A549 cells by glucocorticoids through a GR-mediated pathway, whereas smoking may be able to depress CYP3A5 expression.
CYP2D6 is involved in the O-demethylation metabolic pathway of venlafaxine in humans. In this study, we investigated whether this isozyme is stereoselective. Plasma samples from seven CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and five CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs), collected during a period without and with coadministration of quinidine, were analysed. Subjects were administered venlafaxine hydrochloride 18.75 mg orally every 12 h for 48 h on two occasions (1 week apart); once alone and once during the concomitant administration of quinidine sulphate every 12 h. Blood and urine samples were collected under steady-state conditions over one dosing interval (12 h). The present results show that, although CYP2D6 catalyses the O-demethylation of both enantiomers of venlafaxine, it displays a marked stereoselectivity towards the (R)-enantiomer. The oral clearance of (R)-venlafaxine was found to be nine-fold higher in EMs compared to PMs [median (range) 173 (29-611) l/h versus 20 (16-24) l/h, P < 0.005], while it was two-fold higher for (S)-venlafaxine [73 (32-130) l/h versus 37 (21-44) l/h, P < 0.05]. In EMs, quinidine decreased (R)- and (S)-venlafaxine oral clearance by 12-fold ( 0.05) and four-fold ( 0.05), respectively. In contrast, quinidine did not have any effects on renal clearance of (R)-venlafaxine [4 (2-10) l/h for venlafaxine alone versus 5 (0.6-7) l/h for venlafaxine + quinidine] and of (S)-venlafaxine [4 (1-7) l/h for venlafaxine alone versus 3 (0.4-6) l/h for venlafaxine + quinidine]. The coadministration of quinidine to EMs resulted in an almost complete inhibition of the partial metabolic clearance of (R)-venlafaxine to O-demethylated metabolites [127 (10-493) l/h down to 1 (0.1-3) l/h, 0.05], while a seven-fold reduction was measured for (S)-venlafaxine [47 (14-94) l/h versus 7 (1-19) l/h, 0.05]. In PMs, coadministration of quinidine did not significantly change oral clearance and partial metabolic clearance of (R)- and (S)-venlafaxine to its various metabolites. In contrast, data obtained on the partial metabolic clearance of (R)- and (S)-venlafaxine to N-demethylated metabolites, a reaction which is mediated by CYP3A4, suggest a lack of stereoselectivity of this enzyme.
PTEN is a major tumor suppressor gene that encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase with high sequence similarity to the cytoskeletal protein tensin. PTEN may be involved in the formation and disassembly of focal adhesion and affect cell migration. In the present study, PTEN expression plasmid was constructed and transfected into the hepatoma cell line SMMC-7721 to analyze the alterations of cell motility and FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. It was observed that the overexpression of PTEN gene significantly inhibited cell motility on extracellular matrix (Fn), and the cell migration on fibronectin was reduced by 35%. Similarly, at 30-min and 60-min, the cell spreading on Fn but not on polylysine was inhibited by 29% and 26% respectively. The data obtained from immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyses showed that the overexpression of PTEN did not affect FAK expression but resulted in a decrease in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. The level of FAK phosphorylation was inversely correlated with the level of PTEN protein in three cell lines. It was also found that the overexpression of PTEN led to growth inhibition, with the number of cells in S phase reduced by 16%. These results indicate that PTEN exerts its tumor-suppressive effects on hepatocellular carcinoma cells through the inhibition of cell motility and cell cycle progression.
CD36 has been proposed as a fatty acid translocase and a receptor for HDL and oxidized LDL. The association between CD36 deficiency and insulin resistance remains controversial. We investigated glucose and lipid metabolism in human CD36 deficiency.
"CFTR and the epithelial Na channel (ENaC) are two membrane proteins expressed in the apical membrane of several epithelia. They have been shown to influence each other's function but the mechanisms of this interaction are not fully understood. We have explored the role of electrical coupling between the ion fluxes carried by these two electrogenic transporters as one among other possible mechanisms through which these two proteins could interact. For this purpose, we have built a mathematical model of an epithelial cell monolayer comprising variable apical Cl(-) and Na(+) conductances, a basolateral Na,K-pump, basolateral Cl(-) and K(+) conductances and a paracellular ""shunt"" conductance. The model allows us to simulate ion transport under current- or voltage-clamp conditions and to monitor individual ionic membrane currents, membrane potentials and intracellular ion concentrations. Using a set of transport parameters extrapolated from published work, we can show, first, that the model reproduces the expected effects of conductance inhibition on transepithelial transport, and transepithelial and single membrane potentials or conductances. Second, concerning the influence of CFTR on ENaC, the simulations show that: (1) under current-clamp conditions, the amplitude of the apical membrane Cl(-) conductance has a strong influence on the transepithelial depolarization induced by inhibition of the apical Na(+) conductance, (2) under voltage-clamp conditions, the decrease of short-circuit current induced by inhibition of the apical Na(+) conductance is also significantly decreased by the presence of a large apical membrane Cl(-) conductance. Our results show that when ENaC and CFTR are expressed in the same apical membrane, the electrical coupling of these two ion channels can explain at least part of the effect of CFTR activation on the Na(+) current flowing through ENaC."
CD38 is a progression marker in HIV-1 infection, it displays lateral association with CD4, and down-modulates gp120/CD4 binding. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism behind the interplay between CD4, CD38, and HIV-1. We used mouse cell transfectants expressing human CD4 and either CD38 or other CD4-associated molecules to show that CD38 specifically inhibits gp120/CD4 binding. Human cell transfectants expressing truncated forms of CD38 and bioinformatic analysis were used to map the anti-HIV activity and show that it is concentrated in the membrane-proximal region. This region displayed significant sequence-similarity with the V3 loop of the HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein. In line with this similarity, synthetic soluble peptides derived from this region reproduced the anti-HIV effects of full-length CD38 and inhibited HIV-1 and HIV-2 primary isolates from different subtypes and with different coreceptor use. A multiple-branched peptide construct presenting part of the sequence of the V3-like region potently and selectively inhibited HIV-1 replication in the nanomolar range. Conversely, a deletion in the V3-like region abrogated the anti-HIV-1 activity of CD38 and its lateral association with CD4. These findings may provide new insights into the early events of HIV-1 fusion and strategies to intervene.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in many human cancers. We used the Cre-loxP system to generate a keratinocyte-specific null mutation of Pten in mice (k5Pten(flox/flox) mice). k5Pten(flox/flox) mice exhibit wrinkled skin because of epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis and ruffled, shaggy, and curly hair. Histological examination revealed that skin morphogenesis is accelerated in k5Pten(flox/flox) mice. Within 3 weeks of birth, 90% of k5Pten(flox/flox) mice die of malnutrition possibly caused by hyperkeratosis of the esophagus. All k5Pten(flox/flox) mice develop spontaneous tumors within 8.5 months of birth, and chemical treatment accelerates the onset of tumors. k5Pten(flox/flox) keratinocytes are hyperproliferative and resistant to apoptosis and show increased activation of the Pten downstream signaling mediators Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Pten is thus an important regulator of normal development and oncogenesis in the skin.
CYP2B6 plays an important role in the metabolism of a variety of structurally unrelated xenobiotics, including the anticancer drugs cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. Previous studies have shown that the nuclear receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) are involved in the transcriptional regulation of CYP2B genes through the phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module (PBREM). However, for human CYP2B6 the relatively weak response of the PBREM to PXR and CAR activation in transfection assays fails to describe the potent induction observed in primary human hepatocyte cultures. In this report, a novel nuclear receptor response module located -8.5 kilobases upstream from the CYP2B6 encoding region is described. Several potential PXR/CAR binding motifs were identified within the distal regulatory cluster. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, one DR4 motif showed the strongest binding to both PXR and CAR. Transient transfection assays in HepG2 cells demonstrated that the novel distal response cluster could be activated by PXR and CAR. In primary human hepatocytes, both PBREM and the distal responsive element were activated individually by endogenous nuclear receptors upon exposure to prototypical inducers. However, in both HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes maximal reporter activation was observed in a construct containing both PBREM and the distal responsive element. In mouse tail-vein injection experiments, a construct containing both the distal responsive element and the proximal PBREM exhibited a strong synergistic expression in phenobarbital-treated mice. These results show that a novel xenobiotic-responsive enhancer module in the distal region of the CYP2B6 promoter (CYP2B6-XREM) together with the PBREM mediates optimal drug-induced expression of CYP2B6.
PTEN (also designated MMAC1) gene is a new tumor suppressor gene proved to be a lipid phosphatase. The target lipid, called phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, PIP3, and it is a key component of the major cell growth control pathways, acting both to stimulate cell growth and to inhibit tumor cell proliferation blocking apoptosis. PTEN mutations have been linked to a variety of human cancers. Mutations of PTEN during tumorigenesis allow the mutated cells to grow unchecked when they should die.
WWOX (WW domain containing oxidoreductase), a putative tumor suppressor gene that maps to the common fragile site FRA16D on chromosome 16q23.3-24.1, is altered in breast, esophageal, and ovarian cancer. Because the FRA3B/FHIT locus at 3p14.2 is a preferential target for genetic changes caused by tobacco smoke, we intended to evaluate the status of the FRA16D/WWOX gene in non-small cell lung cancer; we have analyzed 27 paired normal and tumor lung tissues and 8 lung cancer cell lines for WWOX alterations by reverse transcriptase-PCR, loss of heterozygosity, and mutation analysis. Transcripts missing WWOX exons were detected in 7 primary tumors (7 of 27; 25.9%) and 5 of 8 cell lines. In addition, loss of heterozygosity at the WWOX locus was observed in 10 primary tumors (10 of 27; 37.0%). We conclude that WWOX alterations occur in a significant fraction of lung cancers and may contribute to the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer.
ABCA4 gene sequence alterations cause Stargardt's disease (STGD) and may cause some age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We sought to shed light on these associations among Hong Kong Chinese by genotyping 140 AMD, 18 STGD and 95 normal control subjects for 15 ABCA4 exons which were reported to often contain AMD- or STGD-associated mutations. Sequence alterations R212H, T1428M, V1433I, T1572M, I2166M, IVS6-5T>G and IVS33+1G>T were found in AMD patients. T1428M and R2040X occurred in STGD patients. Control subjects displayed all the above missense alterations but no splicing or nonsense changes. Therefore, ABCA4 splicing mutations may be associated with a small proportion of AMD cases.
CYP1A1 is involved in the metabolism of benzopyrene, a suspected lung carcinogen; it is therefore conceivable that genetically determined variations in its activity modify individual susceptibility to lung cancer. The role of the CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism in lung cancer has been widely studied but has not been fully clarified. We have included 2,451 cases and 3,358 controls in a pooled analysis of 22 case-control studies on CYP1A1 and lung cancer risk. We found a clear association between the CYP1A1 homozygous MspI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and lung cancer risk in Caucasians (age- and gender-adjusted odds ratio = 2.36; 95% confidence interval 1.16-4.81); other associations were weaker or not statistically significant. The association with the homozygous variant was equally strong for squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas among Caucasians. We analyzed the risk by duration of smoking: for Caucasian subjects with the MspI RFLP combined variants (homozygotes plus heterozygotes), the increase in the risk of lung cancer was steeper than among the individuals with the homozygous reference allele. Our analysis suggests that Caucasians with homozygous variant CYP1A1 polymorphism have a higher risk of lung cancer. The data were more consistent among Caucasians, with a strong association between the homozygous variant in both squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas, and a stronger association in men than in women. The analyses were more inconsistent and failed to reach statistical significance in Asians. This observation might be due to design specificities or unknown effect modifiers in the Asian studies.
CYP2E1 is one of the major cytochrome P450 forms whose expression is strongly inhibited by inflammatory cytokines in humans and rodents. In the present study, we have used the Fao rat hepatoma cell line that constitutively expresses CYP2E1 enzyme to investigate mechanisms of cytokine action. The cells were treated with interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), or IL-6 for 24 or 72 h, and the expression of CYP2E1 was monitored at the transcriptional, mRNA, and protein levels. All three cytokines decreased the CYP2E1 mRNA levels after 24 h, and the effect was even stronger after 72 h. In contrast, significant inhibition of CYP2E1 protein was seen only after 72 h. In transfection assays using a CYP2E1 5' -3685 to +29-luciferase construct, it was found that IL-6 inhibited gene transcription after 24 h, but a similar effect by IL-1beta and TNFalpha was registered only after 72 h. Using 5' deletions of the CYP2E1 5'-reporter construct a responsive region for the IL-6 effect was located to -669 to -507 base pairs in the CYP2E1 5'-flanking region. Interestingly, IL-1beta, but not TNFalpha, was found to reduce hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha binding to the CYP2E1 promotor. However, the transactivation function of HNF-1alpha was found to be impaired in Fao cells. In mouse primary hepatocytes, IL-1beta decreased HNF-1alpha-mediated transactivation. In conclusion, our data indicate that inflammatory cytokines inhibit CYP2E1 expression by multiple mechanisms, including control of HNF-1alpha function and regulation of other transcriptional factors acting on the CYP2E1 5'-upstream regulatory region. In addition, regulation of factors of importance for the CYP2E1 mRNA stability may be involved.
PGM1 genotyping by PCR-SSCP analysis.
CYP3A4 is the most abundant cytochrome P450 in human liver, comprising approximately 30% of the total liver P450 content. This enzyme has an important role in endogenous processes, most notably steroid catabolism, and also plays a fundamental role in the metabolism of more than half of the clinically used drugs currently prescribed. The majority of CYP3A substrates are also capable of upregulating CYP3A activity, mainly through transcriptional activation. The molecular mechanisms that underlie the transcriptional activation of CYP3A4 are complex, with many steroid hormone nuclear receptors, including GR, PXR, VDR and CAR, playing a role in these mechanisms. However, the net result of transcriptional activation is an increase in the metabolism of the inducing compounds and, therefore, increased clearance. An important side effect of this transcriptional activation is that co-administered chemicals metabolized by CYP3A may also have their pharmacokinetics altered. Such changes can result in reduced clinical efficacy of drugs, resulting in poor patient response, or the development of an adverse drug response. This review will examine examples of established interactions caused through transcriptional activation of CYP3A4, and speculate on whether such effects are clinically important and should be considered during the design of treatment regimes or, alternatively, are relatively minor and cause little physiological effects.
CYP4B1 isoforms from rodents and other common laboratory animals are involved in the bioactivation of a range of protoxins, including 2-aminofluorene, 4-ipomeanol, and valproic acid. However, an earlier study provided evidence for a human allele encoding a nonfunctional CYP4B1 enzyme due to a Pro427Ser transversion in the meander region of the protein. In the present study, the CYP4B1 gene from several racial groups, Caucasians, African-Americans, and Hispanics, and from six nonhuman primate species was genotyped using a PCR-Hinf1 restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism assay or by direct sequencing. All human populations examined were found to possess only the Ser allele at codon 427 ((1279)TCT) and all of the nonhuman primate species possessed only the Pro (CCT) allele. Therefore, an inactivating (1279)C-->T mutation in the human CYP4B1 gene likely arose following divergence of the Homo and Pan clades. Amino acid sequence alignments revealed further that this key Pro residue is located two amino acid residues N-terminal to the distal Arg of a Glu-Arg-Arg triad thought to participate in heme binding and/or redox partner interactions. Mutation of the corresponding Arg424 residue in rabbit CYP4B1 to Leu, but not His, resulted in a loss of lauric acid hydroxylase activity and ability to generate a reduced-CO binding spectrum. These data provide additional evidence for the importance of this meander region Pro-X-Arg motif in CYP4B1 heme binding and catalytic function.
CD38 expression on chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells is a poor prognostic factor, however, methods for measuring this vary. The QuantiBRITETM flow cytometry (FC) system yields an absolute antigen expression value (antibodies bound/cell, ABC) and may be useful in standardizing CD38 expression analysis. We evaluated cryopreserved pretreatment CLL cells for CD20 ABC, CD38 ABC, and percentage of CD38+ B cells from 131 patients requiring therapy. The 92 patients (70%) with >/= 100 CD38 ABC had worse overall survival (OS; 34% at 5 years) compared with those with < 100 CD38 ABC (70% at 5 years, mortality hazard ratio 2.30, 95% confidence interval 1.28-4.12; two-tailed P = 0.003). Among the 64 patients with < 30% CD38+ cells, OS of the 25 with >/= 100 ABC was worse than that of the 39 with < 100 ABC (P = 0.018). OS of patients with < 30% CD38+ cells and >/= 100 ABC was actually similar to that of patients with >/= 30% CD38+ cells. BrightCD20 expression (>/= 20 000 ABC) was not associated with a worse OS (P = 0.10). The presence of >/= 100 CD38 ABC in CLL patients requiring therapy is an unfavourable prognostic factor for OS and quantitative FC may be superior to percentage CD38+ cell assessment. Prospective trials are required to determine more precisely the prognostic significance of absolute expression levels in fresh CLL cells.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in many human sporadic cancers and in hereditary cancer syndromes such as Cowden disease, Bannayan-Zonana syndrome and Lhermitte-Duclos disease. The major substrate of PTEN is PIP3, a second messenger molecule produced following PI3K activation induced by variety of stimuli. PIP3 activates the serine-threonine kinase PKB/Akt which is involved in anti-apoptosis, proliferation and oncogenesis. In mice, heterozygosity for a null mutation of Pten (Pten(+/-) mice) frequently leads to the development of a variety of cancers and autoimmune disease. Homozygosity for the null mutation (Pten (-/-) mice) results in early embryonic lethality, precluding the functional analysis of Pten in various organs. To investigate the physiological functions of Pten in viable mice, various tissue-specific Pten mutations have been generated using the Cre-loxP system. This review will summarize the phenotypes of conditional mutant mice lacking Pten function in specific tissues, and discuss how these phenotypes relate to the physiological roles of Pten in various organ systems.
GPI lipid anchoring is an important post-translational modification of eukaryote proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. In total, 19 genes have been directly implicated in the anchor synthesis and the substrate protein modification pathway. Here, the molecular functions of the respective proteins and their evolution are analyzed in the context of reported literature data and sequence analysis studies for the complete pathway (http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/SEQUENCES/gpi-biosynthesis/) and questions for future experimental investigation are discussed. Studies of two of these proteins have provided new mechanistic insights. The cytosolic part of PIG-A/GPI3 has a two-domain alpha/beta/alpha-layered structure; it is suggested that its C-terminal subsegment binds UDP-GlcNAc whereas the N-terminal domain interacts with the phosphatidylinositol moiety. The lumenal part of PIG-T/GPI16 apparently consists of a beta-propeller with a central hole that regulates the access of substrate protein C termini to the active site of the cysteine protease PIG-K/GPI8 (gating mechanism) as well as of a polypeptide hook that embraces PIG-K/GPI8. This structural proposal would explain the paradoxical properties of the GPI lipid anchor signal motif and of PIG-K/GPI8 orthologs without membrane insertion regions in some species.
CD36 is a platelet surface receptor protein that plays a major role in platelet aggregation and accumulation that is mediated by parasitic attachment. The CD36 receptor is constitutively phosphorylated by E-kinase/PKA, resulting in increased affinity for collagen, but preventing spontaneous platelet aggregation. Dephosphorylation of CD36 by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) leads to increased affinity for thrombospondin at a different rate than that of collagen-mediated platelet aggregation. Depletion of the E-kinase/PKA substrate [ATP](0)by E-NTPase-mediated hydrolysis, in conjunction with inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid, could prove to be a valuable tool in inhibiting CD36 activation, thus preventing platelet aggregation and thrombus formation.
CD36 is a suspected facilitator of long chain fatty acid transport and as a thrombospondin (TSP) receptor, thereby being implicated in cell proliferation, angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. The human amelanotic melanoma cell line, C32, is known to express CD36 and has been as a model for studying TSP binding.
ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) improve insulin resistance and prevent type 2 diabetes, possibly mediated by inhibition of bradykinin (BK) degradation. The vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat (OMA) raises BK to a greater extent than ACEIs by dual enzyme inhibition, whereas its insulin-sensitizing effects and mechanisms have not been investigated.
CS gas (2-chlorobenzylidene malonitrile) is widely used in an incapacitant spray that causes intense lacrimation, blepharospasm and burning sensations in the throat and nose. Questions have been raised about its safety. We obtained information on short-term and long-term symptoms, and performed ear, nose and throat examinations and respirometry at 8-10 months, in 34 young adults who had been exposed to CS spray in a confined space during a confrontation with police. The group was subdivided into those who had been sprayed directly on the face (n=10) and those exposed indirectly. At one hour, all but 2 individuals still had symptoms; respiratory and oral symptoms were significantly more prevalent in the directly exposed group. At one month, only oral symptoms were significantly more prevalent. At 8-10 months, symptoms were still reported but there were no differences between the groups and clinical examinations revealed no specific abnormalities. There was no convincing evidence of long-term physical sequelae from exposure to CS spray.
UCP2 (the lowest Km values: 20 and 29 microm, respectively) for omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), all-cis-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic and all-cis-6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acids, which are also the most potent agonists of the nuclear PPARbeta receptor in the activation of UCP2 transcription. omega-3 PUFA, cis-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid had lower affinity (Km, 50 microm), although as an omega-6 PUFA, arachidonic acid exhibited the same low affinity as lauric acid (Km, approximately 200 microm). These findings suggest a possible dual role of some PUFAs in activating both UCPn expression and uncoupling activity. UCP2 (UCP3)-dependent H+ translocation activated by all tested FAs was inhibited by purine nucleotides with apparent affinity to UCP2 (reciprocal Ki) decreasing in order: ADP > ATP approximately GTP > GDP >> AMP. Also [3H]GTP ([3H]ATP) binding to isolated Escherichia coli (Kd, approximately 5 microm) or yeast-expressed UCP2 (Kd, approximately 1.5 microm) or UCP3 exhibited high affinity, similar to UCP1. The estimated number of [3H]GTP high affinity (Kd, <0.4 microm) binding sites was (in pmol/mg of protein) 182 in lung mitochondria, 74 in kidney, 28 in skeletal muscle, and approximately 20 in liver mitochondria. We conclude that purine nucleotides must be the physiological inhibitors of UCPn-mediated uncoupling in vivo.
TAT peptide was attached to the surface of plain and PEGylated liposomes. These TAT peptide-modified liposomes have been shown to translocate into a variety of normal and cancer cells if a non-hindered interaction between the cell surface and liposome-attached TAT peptide was made possible. TAT peptide-liposomes translocated into cells remain intact within first few hours as proved by a co-localization of fluorescent markers entrapped inside liposomes and incorporated into the liposomal membrane. After 2 hours liposomes had slowly migrating towards cell nuclei. Liposomes had completely disintegrated with their inner marker released by approximately 9 hours. TAT peptide-liposomes were made slightly cationic by adding up to 10 mol %. of a cationic lipid (DOTAP). These slightly cationic liposomes were non-toxic towards cells, formed firm complexes with DNA (plasmid encoding for the formation of the Green Fluorescent Protein), and efficiently transfected a variety of cells. TAT peptide-liposomes can be considered as promising carriers for the non-endocytotic intracellular delivery of drugs and DNA.
ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce mortality, reduce hospitalization, reduce symptoms, and increase exercise capacity in patients with heart failure and a large heart (low ejection fraction). The evidence is overwhelming. There are some subgroups of patients, such as the very elderly and those with a normal ejection fraction, where uncertainty still exists. The combination of a diuretic and an ACE inhibitor is currently the proper treatment of congestive heart failure; a beta-blocker should be added in selected patients. The evidence for the efficacy of ARB is less persuasive and, for the present, this class of drug should be prescribed only when an ACE inhibitor cannot be tolerated. The results of the trials emphasize an emerging problem in medicine, namely how to evaluate a new treatment that may be as efficacious as current therapy but with fewer side-effects. Proving equivalence in efficacy will be difficult, requiring large studies comparing new drugs with the best current treatment. The most common etiology of heart failure is coronary heart disease. If further studies provide more support for the idea that ACE inhibitors prevent ischemic episodes and delay the onset of heart failure, then a new indication for ACE inhibitors will be the prevention of heart failure.
PAH concentration and distribution has been examined in surface sediments samples from the Kara Sea, Russia. The study includes 13 samples from the South-eastern Kara Sea shelf, one sample from the south-western part of the sea, 4 samples from the Baydaratskaya Bay, 5 samples from the Gulf of Ob and 4 samples from the Yenisei Bay, collected in August-September 1993-1994. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to identify common patterns and possible sources of PAHs. The total PAH concentration (sum of two- to six-ring aromatic hydrocarbons) in the Kara Sea sediments was generally lower than in the Barents Sea sediments and comparable to the levels in the Pechora and White seas. Two- and three-ring aromatic hydrocarbons predominated in Kara Sea sediments, which indicate a relatively stronger petrogenic origin than that in the adjacent seas. The highest total PAH concentrations within the Kara Sea were found in sediments from the Yenisei Bay and in the South-western part of the Kara Sea in the Eastern Novaya Zemlya Trough. The PAHs of the Yenisei Bay sediments were dominated by perylene and PAHs of petrogenic origin, but had also a strong indication of PAHs of pyrogenic origin. The dominating PAH group in the South-western part of the Kara Sea were four- to six-ring aromatic hydrocarbons, indicating pyrogenic origin. Perylene levels were high in all the Kara Sea samples, and highest levels were found in areas of strong terrigenous influence. The most probable source is decaying peat products being transported to the Kara Sea by both large and small rivers.
COMT is a ubiquitous enzyme crucial to catechol metabolism. The molecular basis of COMT thermolability, that leads to three to fourfold differences in enzyme activity, is due to a substitution of valine with methionine in the Val158/108Met polymorphism. Of special interest is the role of this gene in major psychoses especially since a microdeletion (22q11) containing the COMT gene (velo-cardio-facial syndrome) also carries with it several types of behavioral disorders, including an increased prevalence of schizophrenia. Almost 20 genetic studies have examined the role of COMT in schizophrenia with ambiguous results. Towards clarifying the role of this polymorphism in conferring risk for psychosis, we examined a large group of culturally and ethnically akin Palestinian Arab schizophrenic triads (N = 276) using both a case-control and family-based study. In 194 informative triads with at least one heterozygote parent, no preferential transmission of either COMT allele was observed in this sample (TDT statistic chi-square = 0.14 NS; 131 COMT valine alleles were transmitted and 125 alleles not transmitted). However, using a case-control design a significant increase (Likelihood ratio = 3.935, P = 0.047) in the valine allele was observed in the group of schizophrenic patients (N = 276) compared to an ethnically matched control group (N = 77). The association was stronger in female patients (P = 0.012) similar to other studies showing that some COMT behavioral effects are gender sensitive. In summary, by case-control design but not by a family-based study, there is a weak effect in female patients of the high activity COMT allele in conferring risk for schizophrenia.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome-10), a dual specificity phosphatase, is a tumor suppressor gene whose inactivation has been associated with many different types of cancer including prostate cancer. Prostate adenocarcinoma is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies afflicting the male population in both the United States and Europe. The frequency of PTEN inactivation appears to increase during the progression of prostatic cancer. The physical loss of the PTEN genetic locus in prostate cancer progression has been well characterized, however the molecular implication of this loss of PTEN remains enigmatic. The purpose of this review is to describe the functional role of PTEN in the molecular pathogenesis of prostatic disease. We review the function of PTEN discussing its association with the phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways. Additionally, we discuss the role of PTEN in the regulation of apoptotic pathways involving the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 and the pro-apoptotic ligand TRAIL. We also review the mechanisms that can lead to the loss of PTEN function. We describe genetic inactivation including loss of heterozygosity, haploinsufficiency and mutation. We conclude by outlining epigenetic loss including methylation, post-translational modifications and oxidative stress.
CD38 signaling, either induced by ligation with specific agonistic monoclonal antibody (mAb) or after interaction with CD31, its cognate counter-receptor, is involved in release of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10 cytokines in resting human monocytes. CD38 ligation by the F(ab')(2) IB4 mAb did not induce signals relevant for cytokine secretion and the block of the Fcgamma receptor I (FcgammaRI) by anti-CD64 or FcgammaRII by anti-CD32 mAb did not inhibit CD38-mediated IL-1beta release. Dimerization or multimerization of the CD38 molecule by: (i) cross-linking of the receptor ligated by F(ab')(2) or by (ii) increasing CD38 expression by treating monocytes with IFNgamma were able to restore the truncated CD38-mediated signals involved in cytokine secretion. These data indicate that CD38 receptor-mediated signals operate directly suggesting a Fcgamma receptorial surface molecule independent activation pathway. The key element for the receptor mediated signaling is represented by surface density of CD38 on resting monocytes.
ACE displays potent vasoconstrictive effects, attenuation of fibrinolysis, and platelet activation and aggregation, thus possibly promoting venous thromboembolism (VTE). The ACE gene contains an insertion (I) or deletion (D) polymorphism accounting for 50% of the variation in serum ACE concentration. To evaluate the role of the I/D polymorphism in VTE, its prevalence was determined in 931 patients with VTE and 432 blood donors. The prevalence of the DD genotype was 27.6% in patients and 21.3% in controls (OR 1.4; p < 0.02). In multivariate analysis there was a trend of the DD genotype to be an independent risk factor (OR 1.4; p = 0.08). No differences in DD genotype prevalence according to exogenous risk factors were found. Coinheritance of FV G1691A, PT G20210A mutation, and PS deficiency with the DD genotype increased the relative risk of VTE. Thus, the ACE DD genotype is a moderate risk factor of hereditary thrombophilia. Exogenous risk factors did not alter the manifestation of VTE among carriers of the DD genotype, whereas coinheritance of the DD genotype with the aforementioned defects increased the risk for VTE considerably.
PGD represents an alternative within prenatal diagnosis services, which avoids terminating affected on-going pregnancies. In Greece, prevention programmes for haemoglobinopathies, including the option of prenatal diagnosis, are well established. Following optimization of a single-cell genotyping strategy (designed to be applicable for the majority of beta-thalassaemia major or sickle thalassaemia genotype interactions) along with close collaboration with an IVF unit, we integrated the option of PGD for at-risk couples with a problematic reproductive history. A total of 59 couples requesting PGD were counselled, of whom 41 initiated 63 PGD cycles. Following standard assisted reproduction treatment for oocyte retrieval, 20 cycles were cancelled (too few oocytes and/or poor quality embryos), but in 43 cycles single blastomeres were biopsied from 3 day embryos and genotyped (total 302). Diagnosis was achieved for 236 embryos, and 100 of 125 unaffected embryos were transferred. Sixteen pregnancies were established, although six were lost within the first trimester. Ten pregnancies underwent second trimester prenatal diagnosis, with nine pregnancies (13 babies: six singletons, two twins and one triplet) confirmed unaffected, although one singleton was a PGD misdiagnosis and terminated. The triplet pregnancy was selectively reduced to twins, and nine pregnancies went to term, with 12 healthy babies born. This report highlights advantages, limitations and approaches towards improvement when incorporating PGD within genetic services for a common recessive disease.
SLC26A6 (or putative anion transporter 1, PAT1) is located on the apical membrane of mouse kidney proximal tubule and mediates Cl-/HCO3- exchange in in vitro expression systems. We hypothesized that PAT1 along with a Cl-/HCO3- exchange is present in apical membranes of rat kidney proximal tubules. Northern hybridizations indicated the exclusive expression of SLC26A6 (PAT1 or CFEX) in rat kidney cortex, and immunocytochemical staining localized SLC26A6 on the apical membrane of proximal tubules, with complete prevention of the labeling with the preadsorbed serum. To examine the functional presence of apical Cl-/HCO3- exchanger, proximal tubules were isolated, microperfused, loaded with the pH-sensitive dye BCPCF-AM, and examined by digital ratiometric imaging. The pH of the perfusate and bath was kept at 7.4. Buffering capacity was measured, and transport rates were calculated as equivalent base flux. The results showed that in the presence of basolateral DIDS (to inhibit Na+-HCO3- cotransporter 1) and apical EIPA (to inhibit Na+/H+ exchanger 3), the magnitude of cell acidification in response to addition of luminal Cl- was approximately 5.0-fold higher in the presence than in the absence of CO2/HCO3-. The Cl--dependent base transport was inhibited by approximately 61% in the presence of 0.5 mM luminal DIDS. The presence of physiological concentrations of oxalate in the lumen (200 microM) did not affect the Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity. These results are consistent with the presence of SLC26A6 (PAT1) and Cl-/HCO3- exchanger activity in the apical membrane of rat kidney proximal tubule. We propose that SLC26A6 is likely responsible for the apical Cl-/HCO3- (and Cl-/OH-) exchanger activities in kidney proximal tubule.
CYP2E1 is an ethanol- and drug-metabolizing enzyme that can also activate procarcinogens and hepatotoxicants and generate reactive oxygen species; it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of liver diseases and cancer. Cigarette smoke increases CYP2E1 activity in rodents and in humans and we have shown that nicotine (0.1-1.0 mg/kg s.c. x 7 days) increases CYP2E1 protein and activity in the rat liver. In the current study, we have shown that the induction peaks at 4 h postnicotine (1 mg/kg s.c. x 7 days) treatment and recovers within 24 h. No induction was observed after a single injection, and 18 days of treatment did not increase the levels beyond that found at 7 days. We found that CYP2E1 is induced by very low doses of chronic (x 7 days) nicotine with an ED50 value of 0.01 mg/kg s.c.; 0.01 mg/kg in a rat model results in peak cotinine levels (nicotine metabolite) similar to those found in people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (passive smokers; 2-7 ng/ml). Previously, we have shown no change in CYP2E1 mRNA, and our current mechanistic study indicates that nicotine does not regulate CYP2E1 expression by protein stabilization. We postulated that a nicotine metabolite could be causing the induction but found that cotinine (1 mg/kg x 7 days) did not increase CYP2E1. Our findings indicate that nicotine increases CYP2E1 at very low doses and may enhance CYP2E1-related toxicity in smokers, passive smokers, and people treated with nicotine (e.g., smokers, patients with Alzheimer's disease, ulcerative colitis or Parkinson's disease).
CYP2C8 plays important roles in metabolizing therapeutic drugs and endogenous compounds. Although genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C8 were reported, there is little information on CYP2C8 polymorphisms in the Japanese population. In the present study, we screened for previously described polymorphisms in the coding region of this gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism or allele specific-PCR analyses. Eleven polymorphisms of CYP2C8*2 (I269F), CYP2C8*3 (R139K, K399R), CYP2C8*4 (I264M), CYP2C8*5 (frameshift), T130N, E154D, N193K, K249R, L390S, P404A, and H411L have been comprehensively investigated in at least 200 Japanese individuals. A single subject was heterozygous for CYP2C8*5, and the allele frequency was calculated as 0.0025. The other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were not found in the Japanese subjects in the present study. Thus, it appears that the frequencies of these alleles in Japanese are extremely low. In addition, concerning the SNPs of T130N, E154D, N193K, K249R, and H411L, it remains clear that these alleles exist as polymorphisms or represent sequence errors or cloning artifacts. Although several SNPs such as CYP2C8*2, CYP2C8*3, CYP2C8*4, and P404A have been reported to reduce the enzymatic activity, pharmacokinetic abnormalities of drugs metabolized by polymorphic CYP2C8 might be rare in Japanese.
CYP2C9 is a polymorphic enzyme, and CYP2C9*3 is associated with decreased metabolic activity. In addition to the impaired metabolism, we investigated whether the CYP2C9*3 exhibited altered inhibitory susceptibility compared with CYP2C9*1.
EBP (emopamil-binding protein) is a high-affinity binding protein for [3H]emopamil and belongs to the family of so-called sigma receptors. Mutations that disrupt EBP's 3beta-hydroxysteroid sterol delta8-delta7 isomerase activity (EC 5.3.3.5) impair cholesterol biosynthesis and cause X-chromosomal dominant chondrodysplasia punctata. We identified a human cDNA for a novel EBPL (EBP-like protein) with a calculated mass of 23.2 kDa. Amino acid sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis revealed that EBPL is distantly related to EBP (31% identity and 52% similarity) and found in animals but not in plants. EBPL is encoded by four exons on human chromosome 13q14.2 covering 30.7 kb, and a partially processed EBPL pseudogene was found on 16q21. The EBPL mRNA was expressed ubiquitously and most abundant in liver, lung and kidney. Upon heterologous expression in yeast EBPL had no detectable 3beta-hydroxysteroid sterol delta8-delta7 isomerase and sigma-ligand-binding activity. Nine out of ten amino acid residues essential for catalytic activity of EBP were conserved in EBPL. Replacement of the only differing residue (EBP-Y111W) reduced catalytic activity of EBP. Transfer of the divergent residue from EBP to EBPL (EBPL-W91Y) and chimaerization of EBP and EBPL at various positions failed to restore catalytic activity of EBPL. Chemical cross-linking induced homodimerization of EBPL and EBP. Whereas mevinolin increased the mRNA for EBP and DHCR7 (delta7-sterol reductase) in HepG2 cells, it had no effect on mRNAs for EBPL and sigma1 receptor, indicating that EBP and EBPL expression are not co-ordinated. We propose that EBPL has a yet-to-be-discovered function other than cholesterol biosynthesis.
DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) catalyses the metabolically important reduction of 7,8-dihydrofolate by NADPH. DHFR from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (TmDHFR), which shares similarity with DHFR from Escherichia coli, has previously been characterized structurally. Its tertiary structure is similar to that of DHFR from E. coli but it is the only DHFR characterized so far that relies on dimerization for stability. The midpoint of the thermal unfolding of TmDHFR was at approx. 83 degrees C, which was 30 degrees C higher than the melting temperature of DHFR from E. coli. The turnover and the hydride-transfer rates in the kinetic scheme of TmDHFR were derived from measurements of the steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics using absorbance and stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. The rate constant for hydride transfer was found to depend strongly on the temperature and the pH of the solution. Hydride transfer was slow (0.14 s(-1) at 25 degrees C) and at least partially rate limiting at low temperatures but increased dramatically with temperature. At 80 degrees C the hydride-transfer rate of TmDHFR was 20 times lower than that observed for the E. coli enzyme at its physiological temperature. Hydride transfer depended on ionization of a single group in the active site with a p K(a) of 6.0. While at 30 degrees C, turnover of substrate by TmDHFR was almost two orders of magnitude slower than by DHFR from E. coli; the steady-state rates of the two enzymes differed only 8-fold at their respective working temperatures.
CYP2E1 bioactivates environmental protoxins and metabolizes alcohol. CYP2E1 is induced by alcohol and cigarette smoking and may contribute to metabolic tolerance in alcoholics. The CYP2E1*1D polymorphism has been associated with greater CYP2E1 inducibility. One objective was to determine the frequency of the variant allele in eight ethnic groups. Further, the Canadian Native Indian, South-east Asian Canadian and Caucasian Canadian groups were stratified by alcohol and nicotine dependence (as measured by DSM-IV criteria) to examine the potential association of CYP2E1*1D with drug dependence.
ABO blood group determines plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels and ABH antigens are present on VWF. To investigate whether ABO influences the rate of VWF synthesis, we performed stable transfection of A transferase in a phenotypically group-O endothelial cell line (EAhy926). A transferase expression did not affect the rate of VWF synthesis. Although high levels of A antigen were expressed on the cell surface, no A determinants were added to VWF synthesized within these cells. Further studies demonstrated H structures were not present on EAhy926-derived VWF, despite the fact that H antigen is constitutively expressed by these cells.
PTEN phosphatase is one of the most commonly targeted tumor suppressors in human cancers and a key regulator of cell growth and apoptosis. We have found that PTEN is cleaved by caspase-3 at several target sites, located in unstructured regions within the C terminus of the molecule. Cleavage of PTEN was increased upon TNFalpha-cell treatment and was negatively regulated by phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of PTEN by the protein kinase CK2. The proteolytic PTEN fragments displayed reduced protein stability, and their capability to interact with the PTEN interacting scaffolding protein S-SCAM/MAGI-2 was lost. Interestingly, S-SCAM/MAGI-2 was also cleaved by caspase-3. Our findings suggest the existence of a regulatory mechanism of protein stability and PTEN-protein interactions during apoptosis, executed by caspase-3 in a PTEN phosphorylation-regulated manner.
SOD1 transgenic mice are the most widely used animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In addition to providing valuable insights into the pathogenesis of ALS, these animals are used intensively in many laboratories as an in vivo model for investigating novel therapeutic interventions towards this devastating motorneuron disease. Such pre-clinical studies require objective and reliable quantification of the clinical phenotype of individual mice, most importantly of the neuromuscular abnormalities. Here we compare four parameters of the clinical phenotype: motor signs, body weight, rotarod performance and paw grip endurance for their usefulness in monitoring the SOD1 mouse model. We found that paw grip endurance is a sensitive and inexpensive alternative to the widely used rotarod test.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor that reverses the action of phosphoinositide 3-kinase by catalyzing the removal of the 3' phosphate of phosphoinositides. Despite the critical role of PTEN in cell signaling and regulation, the mechanisms of its membrane recruitment and activation is still poorly understood. PTEN is composed of an N-terminal phosphatase domain, a C2 domain, and a C-terminal tail region that contains the PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 homology (PDZ) domain-binding sequence and multiple phosphorylation sites. Our in vitro surface plasmon resonance measurements using immobilized vesicles showed that both the phosphatase domain and the C2 domain, but not the C-terminal tail, are involved in electrostatic membrane binding of PTEN. Furthermore, the phosphorylation-mimicking mutation on the C-terminal tail of PTEN caused an approximately 80-fold reduction in its membrane affinity, mainly by slowing the membrane-association step. Subcellular localization studies of PTEN transfected into HEK293T and HeLa cells indicated that targeting of PTEN to the plasma membrane is coupled with rapid degradation and that the phosphatase domain and the C2 domain are both necessary and sufficient for its membrane recruitment. Results also indicated that the phosphorylation regulates the targeting of PTEN to the plasma membrane not by blocking the PDZ domain-binding site but by interfering with electrostatic membrane binding of PTEN. On the basis of these results, we propose a membrane-binding and activation mechanism for PTEN, in which the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the C-terminal region serves as an electrostatic switch that controls the membrane translocation of the protein.
CS mice exhibit rhythm splitting in constant darkness (DD). To examine the anatomical and physiological bases of this phenomenon, mouse Period1 (mPer1)-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) mice with rhythm splitting were produced by crossing CS and mPer1::GFP mice. GFP expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) slices showed a clear unimodal rhythm with the highest level at circadian time (CT) 8 or CT12 in splitting and non-splitting GFP mice under DD and no essential differences in the pattern of GFP expression were found between these mice. Moreover, there were no significant differences in the degree of symmetry in the paired rostral, central and caudal SCN between splitting and non-splitting mice. These results indicate that behavioral rhythm splitting in CS mice does not reflect the pattern of clock gene expression in the SCN.
CYP2B6 metabolizes drugs such as nicotine and bupropion, and many toxins and carcinogens. Nicotine induces CYP2B1 in rat brain and in humans polymorphic variation in CYP2B6 affects smoking cessation rates. The aim of this study was to compare CYP2B6 expression in brains of human smokers and non-smokers and alcoholics and non-alcoholics (n=26). CYP2B6 expression was brain region-specific, and was observed in both neurons and astrocytes. CYP2B6 levels were higher in brains of smokers and alcoholics, particularly in cerebellar Purkinje cells and hippocampal pyramidal neurons, cells known to be damaged in alcoholics. Significantly more (p<0.05) CYP2B6 protein was seen in four brain regions of smoking alcoholics compared to non-smoking non-alcoholics: hippocampus (5.8-fold), caudate nucleus (3.3-fold), putamen (3.0-fold) and cerebellar hemisphere (1.6-fold). The genetic variant C1459T (R487C) has been associated with reduced hepatic enzyme levels, stability and activity. Preliminary genotyping of this small sample (n=24) suggested that individuals with the CC genotype had higher brain CYP2B6 than those with the CT or TT genotype. Higher brain CYP2B6 activity in smokers and alcoholics may cause altered sensitivity to centrally acting drugs, increased susceptibility to neurotoxins and carcinogenic xenobiotics and contribute to central tolerance to nicotine.
NQO1 [NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1] has an integral role in cellular responses to oxidative stress. The expression of NQO1 is up-regulated in the mouse following challenge with electrophilic chemicals, in an Nrf2 (NF-E2 p45-related factor 2)-dependent fashion, but the molecular basis for this observation remains unexplained. Through characterization of the murine nqo1 5'-upstream region, we now show that Nrf2 regulates this gene directly via an ARE (antioxidant response element) that lies within a 24 bp region spanning nt -444 to -421. A comprehensive mutation study of this ARE revealed that it does not conform to the currently accepted ARE consensus sequence [(5'-TMAnnRTGAYnnnGCRwwww-3', with essential nucleotides shown in capitals); two cytosine residues (shown in bold in the following sequence) that have been designated 'n' previously because they were thought to be redundant (5'-gagTcA C aGTgAGt C ggCAaaatt-3') have now been found to be essential for enhancer activity; two guanines (also shown in bold) previously regarded as essential for ARE function (5'-gagTcACaGT g AGtCg g CAaaatt-3') have proven to be dispensable]. Examination of wild-type and nrf2 (-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that Nrf2 is essential for both constitutive expression of NQO1 and its induction by sulphoraphane. Electrophoretic mobility-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Nrf2 associates, in low amounts, with the nqo1 ARE under constitutive conditions, and following sulphoraphane challenge of cells, Nrf2 is recruited to the ARE in substantially greater quantities, as a heterodimer with the small Maf (musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma virus) protein, MafK. Also, MafK was found to bind the nqo1 ARE in an Nrf2-independent fashion, and may contribute to transcriptional repression of the oxidoreductase gene. These findings allow a model for transcriptional control of nqo1 through the ARE to be proposed. Furthermore, our results indicate that distinct AREs have differential sequence requirements, and a universally applicable consensus sequence cannot be derived.
CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) mediates chloride conduction across the apical membrane of epithelia, and mutations in CFTR lead to defective epithelial fluid transport. Recently, there has been considerable interest in determining the quaternary structure of CFTR at the cell surface, as such information is a key to understand the molecular basis for pathogenesis in patients harbouring disease-causing mutations. In our previous work [Ramjeesingh, Li, Kogan, Wang, Huan and Bear (2001) Biochemistry 40, 10700-10706], we showed that monomeric CFTR is the minimal functional form of the protein, yet when expressed in Sf 9 cells using the baculovirus system, it also exists as dimers. The purpose of the present study was to determine if dimeric CFTR exists at the surface of mammalian cells, and particularly in epithelial cells. CFTR solubilized from membranes prepared from Chinese-hamster ovary cells stably expressing CFTR and from T84 epithelial cells migrates as predicted for monomeric, dimeric and larger complexes when subjected to sizing by gel filtration and analysis by non-dissociative electrophoresis. Purification of plasma membranes led to the enrichment of CFTR dimers and this structure exists as the complex glycosylated form of the protein, supporting the concept that dimeric CFTR is physiologically relevant. Consistent with its localization in plasma membranes, dimeric CFTR was labelled by surface biotinylation. Furthermore, dimeric CFTR was captured at the apical surface of intact epithelial cells by application of a membrane-impermeable chemical cross-linker. Therefore it follows from the present study that CFTR dimers exist at the surface of epithelial cells. Further studies are necessary to understand the impact of dimerization on the cell biology of wild-type and mutant CFTR proteins.
NPR1 is a key regulator of the salicylic acid (SA) dependent pathogen resistance pathway in plants. In this issue of Cell, Mou and Dong demonstrate that Arabidopsis NPR1 undergoes activation from an inactive oligomer to the active monomer as a result of cellular redox changes induced by SA during systemic acquired resistance.
NPR1 is an essential regulator of plant systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which confers immunity to a broad-spectrum of pathogens. SAR induction results in accumulation of the signal molecule salicylic acid (SA), which induces defense gene expression via activation of NPR1. We found that in an uninduced state, NPR1 is present as an oligomer formed through intermolecular disulfide bonds. Upon SAR induction, a biphasic change in cellular reduction potential occurs, resulting in reduction of NPR1 to a monomeric form. Monomeric NPR1 accumulates in the nucleus and activates gene expression. Inhibition of NPR1 reduction prevents defense gene expression, whereas mutation of Cys82 or Cys216 in NPR1 leads to constitutive monomerization, nuclear localization of the mutant proteins, and defense gene expression. These data provide a missing link between accumulation of SA and activation of NPR1 in the SAR signaling pathway.
PTPRQ (rPTP-GMC1) is a member of the type III receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase family. PTPRQ has very low activity against phosphotyrosine but is active against phosphatidylinositol phosphates that are involved in regulation of survival, proliferation, and subcellular architecture. Here, we report that PTPRQ can be expressed as a cytosolic or a receptor-like protein and that the form, subcellular localization, and cell types in which it is expressed are regulated by alternative promoter use and by alternative splicing. The first promoter drives expression of transcripts encoding a transmembrane protein in human podocytes and lung. PTPRQ protein is localized to the basal membrane of human podocytes, beginning when podocyte progenitors can first be identified in the embryonic kidney. A second promoter drives expression of a transcript that can encode a cytoplasmic protein containing the catalytic site. This is the major PTPRQ transcript in rat mesangial cells and human testis and is upregulated in mesangial cells in a rat model of mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. Differential regulation of expression of the transmembrane vs cytosolic forms, in different cell types during development or response to injury, may be a mechanism through which PTPRQ, with its activities against membrane phospholipids and against phosphotyrosine, can target specific substrates under different conditions.
CYP1A1 is likely to play an important role in the etiology of CaP through its function in activating environmental procarcinogens and catalyzing the oxidative metabolites of estrogens. To test the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms in the CYP1A1 gene may be associated with the risk for CaP, we compared the allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies of 3 SNPs (3801T>C, 2455A>G and 2453C>A) of CYP1A1 among 159 HPC probands, 245 sporadic CaP cases and 222 unaffected men. Two SNPs (3801T>C and 2455A>G) were each individually associated with CaP risk when the allele and genotype frequencies were compared between CaP patients and unaffected controls. Furthermore, a combined SNP analysis using a haplotype approach revealed an even stronger association in Caucasians. Specifically, 4 major haplotypes (T-A-C, C-A-C, C-G-C and T-A-A) accounted for 99.8% of all observed haplotypes. These 4 haplotypes correspond to the previously described nomenclature (CYP1A1*1A, CYP1A1*2A, CYP1A1*2B and CYP1A1*4). The frequencies of these 4 haplotypes were significantly different among CaP patients and controls. The haplotype T-A-C (CYP1A1*1A) was significantly associated with increased risk for CaP, and the haplotype C-A-C (CYP1A1*2A) was significantly associated with decreased risk for CaP. These findings suggest that genetic polymorphisms in CYP1A1 may modify the risk for CaP.
CYP1B1 is unique among P450 cytochromes in exhibiting inductive responses mediated by both the Ah receptor (AhR) and cAMP. cAMP induction was mediated either by a 189bp far upstream enhancer region (FUER, -5110 to -5298) or by a 230bp AhR-responsive enhancer region (AhER) (-797 to -1026). CYP1B1 luciferase reporters respond selectively to cAMP and TCDD in adrenal Y-1 cells (only cAMP), testis MA10 cells (cAMP>TCDD), and C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts (only TCDD). In Y-1 cells, which lack AhR, cAMP induction is totally dependent on the FUER, including absolute requirements for upstream and downstream halves of this region, and for CREB activity at a CRE sequence located at the 3(')-end. cAMP stimulation of the FUER was remarkably high (27-fold) and equally effective when linked to an HSV-TK promoter, indicating direct cAMP activation of the FUER. Binding of CREB to the essential CRE was demonstrated along with dominant negative effects of functionally impaired mutants. cAMP induction in MA10 cells was partially mediated by the FUER mechanism but was regulated additionally by AhER through AhR activity. MA10 cells also exhibit cAMP-dependent AhR down-regulation and AhR/Arnt complex formation. Mutations in AhER including XRE5 were similarly inhibitory to cAMP stimulation in MA10 cells and to TCDD stimulation in C3H10T1/2 cells. Transfection of AhR into the AhR-deficient Y-1 cells did not introduce this second mechanism, which indicated a need for additional components that are present in MA10 cells.
CYP2B6 is a highly polymorphic P450 isozyme involved in the metabolism of endo- and xenobiotics with known implications for the activation of many procarcinogens resulting in carcinogenesis. However, lack of validated high-throughput screening (HTS) CYP2B6 assays has limited the current understanding and full characterization of this isozyme's involvement in human drug metabolism. Here, we have developed and characterized a fluorescence-based HTS assay employing recombinant human CYP2B6 and 2 novel fluorogenic substrates (the Vivid CYP2B6 Blue and Cyan Substrates). Assay validation included testing the inhibitory potency of a panel of drugs and compounds known to be metabolized by this isozyme, including CYP2B6 substrates, inhibitors, and known inducers. Compound rankings based on inhibitory potency in the Vivid CYP2B6 Blue and Cyan Assays matched compound rankings based on relative affinity measurements from previously published data (K(i), K(d), or K(m) values) for the CYP2B6 isozyme. In conclusion, these assays are proven to be robust and sensitive, with broad dynamic ranges and kinetic parameters allowing screening in HTS mode of a large panel of compounds for CYP2B6 metabolism and inhibition, and are a valuable new tool for CYP2B6 studies.
ABO autoantibodies are rare. Most reported examples have been antibodies with 4 degrees C titers not greater than 256 in patients without apparent hemolytic anemia. Most high-titer, high-thermal-amplitude, complement-activating cold agglutinins are associated with hemolytic anemia.
ABO mismatch has not been thought to affect the outcome of patients undergoing myeloablative conditioning and allogeneic HPC transplantation. Data on transplant-related complications after ABO-mismatched transplantation after nonmyeloablative conditioning are limited.
CYP2C19 is an important human drug-metabolizing enzyme that metabolizes a number of clinically used drugs including the antiulcer drug omeprazole, the anxiolytic drug diazepam, the beta-blocker propranolol, the antimalarial drug proguanil, certain antidepressants and barbiturates, and the prototype substrate S-mephenytoin. Previous studies show that compounds such as rifampicin and dexamethasone induce CYP2C19 both in vivo in humans and in vitro in human hepatocytes. This study examines the transcriptional regulation of CYP2C19. Analysis of the CYP2C19 promoter revealed a single constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) binding site (CAR-RE; -1891/-1876 bp) and a glucocorticoid-responsive element (GRE; -1750/-1736 bp). Gel-shift assays showed that CAR-RE binds CAR and pregnane X receptor (PXR). Cotransfection with hCAR, mCAR, or hPXR in HepG2 cells up-regulated transcription of CYP2C19 promoter constructs, whereas mutation of the -1891-bp CAR-RE abolished up-regulation. Expression with hCAR also up-regulated endogenous CYP2C19 mRNA content in HepG2 cells. Androstenol repressed the mCAR-mediated constitutive activation of the CYP2C19 promoter in HepG2 cells, whereas the potent mCAR ligand 1,4-bis[2-3,5-dichloropyridyloxyl)] benzene derepressed this response. Rifampicin produced a modest increase in promoter activity in cells cotransfected with hPXR. Dexamethasone activated the -2.7-kb CYP2C19 promoter constructs in HepG2 cells only in the presence of cotransfected glucocorticoid receptor (GR), whereas the GR antagonist mifepristone inhibits this response. Mutation of the GRE abolishes dexamethasone activation. This is the first study to identify nuclear receptor binding sites (CAR/PXR and GR) in the CYP2C19 promoter and to suggest that these receptors may up-regulate CYP2C19 constitutively and possibly its response to drugs.
ABCG2 is a plasma membrane efflux pump that is able to confer resistance to several anticancer agents, including mitoxantrone, camptothecins, anthracyclines, and flavopiridol. The antimetabolite methotrexate (MTX) was inferred recently to be an additional substrate of the pump based on the analysis of ABCG2-overexpressing cell lines. However, the transport characteristics of the pump with regard to this agent have not been determined. In addition, physiological substrates of ABCG2 have not been identified. Here we examine the in vitro transport properties of the pump using membrane vesicles prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with ABCG2 expression vector. In so doing it is shown that MTX is a high capacity low affinity substrate of the pump, with K(m) and V(max) values of 1.34 +/- 0.18 mM and 687 +/- 87 pmol/mg/min, respectively. Unlike previously characterized multidrug resistance protein family members, ABCG2 is also able to transport MTX diglutamate and MTX triglutamate. However, addition of even one more glutamyl residue is sufficient to completely abrogate ABCG2-mediated transport. By contrast with the wild-type protein (ABCG2-R482), two ABCG2 variants that have been identified in drug selected cell lines, R482T and R482G, were unable to transport MTX to any extent. Similarly, folic acid was subject to efflux by the wild-type protein but not by the two mutants. However, transport of the reduced folate leucovorin was not detected for either the wild-type or the mutant proteins. Finally, it is shown that ABCG2 is capable of transporting E(2)17betaG with K(m) and V(max) values of 44.2 +/- 4.3 micro M and 103 +/- 17 pmol/mg/min, respectively. These results indicate that ABCG2 is a component of the energy-dependent efflux system for certain folates and antifolates, but that its transport characteristics with respect to polyglutamates and reduced folates are not identical to those of multidrug resistance protein family members. In addition, it is demonstrated that R482 mutations observed in drug-resistant cell lines have profound effects on the in vitro transport properties of the pump.
GPI 15715 (AQUAVAN injection) is a new water-soluble prodrug which is hydrolyzed to release propofol. The objectives of this first study in humans were to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical pharmacodynamics of GPI 15715.
UGT1A10 exhibits glucuronidating activity against metabolites of the tobacco smoke carcinogen, benzo(a)pyrene, and is expressed highly in numerous target tissues for tobacco-related cancers including the upper aerodigestive tract. The current study was conducted to determine the prevalence of genetic polymorphisms in the UGT1A10-specific region of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family 1A locus and their relationship with risk for orolaryngeal carcinoma.
LSS and DRS are techniques that provide diagnostically useful information based on changes in the intensity of backscattered light that has experienced either a single or multiple scattering events. These changes can be detected effectively using statistical and model-based algorithms. In addition to providing a means to detect the presence of dysplasia noninvasively, the latter approach yields potentially significant insights into the processes that are involved in the development of dysplasia in BE. Because DRS and LSS provide complementary information to each other and to other spectroscopic modalities, such as fluorescence, it is possible that a combination of all these techniques will ultimately provide a highly accurate real-time method for detecting BE dysplasia. Extending point spectroscopic measurements to imaging of the esophagus will be challenging, but continuous progess in the development of powerful light sources, sensitive detectors, and micro-optical elements should allow this method to become a reality in the near future.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in brain, prostate, and uterine cancers that acts as a phosphatase on phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, antagonizing the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-OH kinase. PTEN manifests its tumor suppressor function in most tumor cells by inducing G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest. To study the mechanism of cell cycle arrest, we established a tetracycline-inducible expression system for PTEN in cell lines lacking this gene. Expression of wild-type PTEN but not of mutant forms unable to dephosphorylate phosphoinositides reduced the expression of cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 reduction was accompanied by a marked decrease in endogenous retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation on cyclin D/CDK4-specific sites, showing an early negative effect of PTEN on Rb inactivation. PTEN expression also prevented cyclin D1 from localizing to the nucleus during the G(1)- to S-phase cell cycle transition. The PTEN-induced localization defect and the cell growth arrest could be rescued by the expression of a nucleus-persistent mutant form of cyclin D1, indicating that an important effect of PTEN is at the level of nuclear availability of cyclin D1. Constitutively active Akt/PKB kinase counteracted the effect of PTEN on cyclin D1 translocation. The data are consistent with an oncogenesis model in which a lack of PTEN fuels the cell cycle by increasing the nuclear availability of cyclin D1 through the Akt/PKB pathway.
PTEN tumor suppressor serves as a major negative regulator of survival signaling mediated by PI3 kinase/AKT/protein kinase B pathway, and is inactivated in various human tumors. Elucidation of mechanisms responsible for PTEN expression is important for providing insight into strategies to control the loss of PTEN expression in human cancers. Although recent studies suggested that p53 and Egr-1 can modulate induced PTEN expression, the mechanism responsible for ubiquitous constitutive expression of PTEN remains elusive. PTEN mRNA contains a highly conserved and GC-rich 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR). Recently, it has been shown that the long 5'-UTR sequences of several growth-regulated mRNAs contain promoters that can generate mRNAs with shorter 5'-UTRs. In this paper, we tested whether the 5'-UTR sequence of mouse PTEN contains a promoter that is responsible for constitutive expression of PTEN. We found that the long 5'-UTR sequence of mouse PTEN severely inhibits translation of PTEN and a heterologous gene firefly luciferase. Deletion of the most 5'-UTR sequence would enhance translation efficiency 100-fold. We also showed that the 5'-UTR sequence of mouse PTEN does not have an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that can mediate cap-independent initiation of translation. Instead, we found that the 5'-UTR sequence of mouse PTEN contains a strong promoter that drives the production of a transcript with shorter 5'-UTRs, which can be translated with higher efficiency. This promoter was mapped to the region between -551 and -220 bases upstream of the translation start codon. Cotransfection analysis using Drosophila SL2 cells showed that Sp1 is one of the major transcription factors that can constitutively activate this promoter. Two endogenous PTEN transcripts with 5'-UTRs of 193 and 109 bases were found in DU145 and H226 cell lines. Based on these observations, we conclude that the PTEN expression may be regulated at both transcriptional and translational levels, and that the 5'-UTR sequence of PTEN contains a promoter that is responsible for constitutive PTEN expression.
CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 represent two particularly important members of the cytochrome p450 enzyme family due to their involvement in the metabolism of many commercially available drugs. Avoiding potent inhibitory interactions with both of these enzymes is highly desirable in early drug discovery, long before entering clinical trials. Computational prediction of this liability as early as possible is desired. Using a commercially available data set of over 1750 molecules to train computer models that were generated with commercially available software enabled predictions of inhibition for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which were compared with empirical data. The results suggest that using a recursive partitioning (tree) technique with augmented atom descriptors enables a statistically significant rank ordering of test-set molecules (Spearman's rho of 0.61 and 0.48 for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, respectively), which represents an increased rate of identifying the best compounds when compared with the random rate. This approach represents a valuable computational filter in early drug discovery to identify compounds that may have p450 inhibition liabilities prior to molecule synthesis. Such computational filters offer a new approach in which lead optimization in silico can occur with virtual molecules simultaneously tested against multiple enzymes implicated in drug-drug interactions, with a resultant cost savings from a decreased level of molecule synthesis and in vitro screening.
CYP1A2 polymorphism has been well studied in white persons and Asians but not in Africans. We performed CYP1A2 genotype and phenotype analysis using caffeine in Ethiopians living in Ethiopia (n = 100) or in Sweden (n = 73). We sequenced the CYP1A2 gene using genomic DNA from 12 subjects, which revealed a novel intron 1 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), -730C>T. We developed SNP-specific polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism genotyping and molecular haplotyping methods for the intron 1 SNPs, and four different haplotypes were identified: CYP1A2*1A (wild-type for all SNPs), CYP1A2*1F (-164A), CYP1A2*1J (-740G and -164A), and CYP1A2*1K (-730T, -740G, and -164A), having frequencies of 39.9, 49.6, 7.5, and 3.0%, respectively. The frequency of CYP1A2*1J and CYP1A2*1K among Saudi Arabians (n = 136) was 5.9% and 3.6%, and among Spaniards (n = 117) 1.3% and 0.5%, respectively. Functional significance of the different intron 1 haplotypes was analyzed. Subjects with CYP1A2*1K had significantly decreased CYP1A2 activity in vivo, and reporter constructs with this haplotype had significantly less inducibility with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in human B16A2 hepatoma cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using nuclear extracts from B16A2 cells revealed a specific DNA binding protein complex to an Ets element. Efficient competition was obtained using oligonucleotide probes carrying the wt sequence and Ets consensus probe, whereas competition was abolished using probes with the -730C>T SNP alone or in combination with -740T>G (CYP1A2*1K). The results indicate a novel polymorphism in intron 1 of importance for Ets-dependent CYP1A2 expression in vivo and inducibility of the enzyme, which might be of critical importance for determination of interindividual differences in drug metabolism and sensitivity to carcinogens activated by CYP1A2.
CD36 (fatty acid translocase) is involved in high-affinity peripheral fatty acid uptake. Mice lacking CD36 exhibit increased plasma free fatty acid and triglyceride (TG) levels and decreased glucose levels. Studies in spontaneous hypertensive rats lacking functional CD36 link CD36 to the insulin-resistance syndrome. To clarify the relationship between CD36 and insulin sensitivity in more detail, we determined insulin-mediated whole-body and tissue-specific glucose uptake in CD36-deficient (CD36-/-) mice. Insulin-mediated whole-body and tissue-specific glucose uptake was measured by d-[3H]glucose and 2-deoxy-d-[1-3H]glucose during hyperinsulinemic clamp in CD36-/- and wild-type control littermates (CD36+/+) mice. Whole-body and muscle-specific insulin-mediated glucose uptake was significantly higher in CD36-/- compared with CD36+/+ mice. In contrast, insulin completely failed to suppress endogenous glucose production in CD36-/- mice compared with a 40% reduction in CD36+/+ mice. This insulin-resistant state of the liver was associated with increased hepatic TG content in CD36-/- mice compared with CD36+/+ mice (110.9 +/- 12.0 and 68.9 +/- 13.6 microg TG/mg protein, respectively). Moreover, hepatic activation of protein kinase B by insulin, measured by Western blot, was reduced by 54%. Our results show a dissociation between increased muscle and decreased liver insulin sensitivity in CD36-/- mice.
ACE inhibitors, when used as monotherapy, are frequently unable to adequately control blood pressure in diabetic patients. A diuretic may be added; however, thiazide diuretics, but not indapamide, have been associated with adverse metabolic effects. Whether these effects also apply to thiazides when administered in the currently used lower doses, and whether they differ from indapamide in their metabolic effects, particularly when used in combination with an ACE inhibitor in diabetic patients, has not been previously studied.
ALDH3A1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1) is expressed at high concentrations in the mammalian cornea and it is believed that it protects this vital tissue and the rest of the eye against UV-light-induced damage. The precise biological function(s) and cellular distribution of ALDH3A1 in the corneal tissue remain to be elucidated. Among the hypotheses proposed for ALDH3A1 function in cornea is detoxification of aldehydes formed during UV-induced lipid peroxidation. To investigate in detail the biochemical properties and distribution of this protein in the human cornea, we expressed human ALDH3A1 in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus vector and raised monoclonal antibodies against ALDH3A1. Recombinant ALDH3A1 protein was purified to homogeneity with a single-step affinity chromatography method using 5'-AMP-Sepharose 4B. Human ALDH3A1 demonstrated high substrate specificity for medium-chain (6 carbons and more) saturated and unsaturated aldehydes, including 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, which are generated by the peroxidation of cellular lipids. Short-chain aliphatic aldehydes, such as acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and malondialdehyde, were found to be very poor substrates for human ALDH3A1. In addition, ALDH3A1 metabolized glyceraldehyde poorly and did not metabolize glucose 6-phosphate, 6-phosphoglucono-delta-lactone and 6-phosphogluconate at all, suggesting that this enzyme is not involved in either glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway. Immunohistochemistry in human corneas, using the monoclonal antibodies described herein, revealed ALDH3A1 expression in epithelial cells and stromal keratocytes, but not in endothelial cells. Overall, these cumulative findings support the metabolic function of ALDH3A1 as a part of a corneal cellular defence mechanism against oxidative damage caused by aldehydic products of lipid peroxidation. Both recombinant human ALDH3A1 and the highly specific monoclonal antibodies described in the present paper may prove to be useful in probing biological functions of this protein in ocular tissue.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene with phosphatase activity. It had been proved the aberrant expression and mutation of PTEN in diverse types of human cancer; PTEN is closely associated with occurrence and development of malignant tumor. This study was conducted to investigate the expression of PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 gene product in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the correlation between the expression of PTEN and the biological behaviors of RCC.
ACE inhibition (ACEi) reduces proteinuria and provides reno-protection, but not all subjects benefit from ACEi. Individual differences in the reduction in proteinuria at the onset of treatment and in residual proteinuria during therapy predict differences in renal outcome. The present study investigated whether individual differences in the anti-proteinuric efficacy of ACEi are explained by differences in the severity of pretreatment renal structural damage and whether differences in the level of residual proteinuria during therapy are explained by the severity of renal structural damage at that time, in adriamycin nephrosis in the rat. Pretreatment renal structural damage was assessed in biopsies 6 weeks after exposure to adriamycin (2 mg/kg iv). Then ACEi (75 mg/l lisinopril, n = 23) or vehicle (n = 10) was administered; renal biopsies were repeated after stabilization of the anti-proteinuric response (week 8). Early renal damage (interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin expression and macrophage accumulation) and established lesions [focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) and interstitial fibrosis] were scored. During ACEi, proteinuria fell from 834 (487-851) mg/24 h pretreatment to 153 (66-265) mg/24 h at week 8 (p < 0.05); FGS stabilized from 27 (4-70) arbitrar units (AU) pretreatment to 26 (4-84) at week 12, whereas the vehicle did not affect proteinuria, resulting in progressive FGS: 18 (10-26) AU pretreatment versus 88 (46-130) at week 12 (p < 0.05). All parameters of pretreatment damage significantly predicted the anti-proteinuric response. Residual proteinuria during ACEi correlated significantly with renal structural damage parameters at that time. Pretreatment renal damage also predicted renal outcome during extended treatment. Thus, in this experimental setting, in rats with the same renal disorder and the same duration of disease, individual differences in pretreatment renal damage, albeit relatively modest, explain individual differences in renal responsiveness to ACEi. This implies that the limits of the efficacy of ACEi are set by prevalent renal damage. Further studies into the mechanisms of individual resistance to the anti-proteinuric action of ACEi are needed to develop additive intervention strategies.
PTEN gene (10q23) is a relevant tumor suppressor gene whose protein is a phosphatase involved in the control of angiogenesis of some tumors including astrocytomas. There are no studies correlating molecular changes of PTEN and the immunohistochemical expression of its protein (pPTEN) with the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in astrocytomas. Fifty-six surgically resected brain gliomas, 10 grade 2, 16 grade 3, and 30 grade 4, were studied by a combined approach, consisting of (1) PCR analysis using four microsatellite markers against the PTEN gene region (10q23), (2) the FISH technique to test chromosome 10 using a pericentromeric probe, and (3) immunohistochemical evaluation of pPTEN and VEGF. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of PTEN was observed in 10% of fibrillary grade 2 astrocytomas and all gemistocytic ones. In high-grade tumors, LOH was more frequent in grade 4 than in grade 3 (> or =2 loci deleted, 83% and 56%, respectively). Monosomy for chromosome 10 was observed especially in high-grade tumors (6% of grade 3 and 50% of grade 4) and in 20% of grade 2 tumors, corresponding to gemistocytic astrocytomas. Results with both antibodies against PTEN were concordant: loss of cytoplasmic immunoreactivity was frequently observed according to homogeneous or heterogeneous patterns in 70% and 50% of grades 4 and 3, respectively, but not in grade 2. Immunonegativity of pPTEN was associated with PTEN gene deletion (> or =2 loci deleted) (P = 0.04) but not with monosomy. Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity against VEGF was observed in high-grade and in gemistocytic astrocytomas, but not in conventional grade 2 tumors. Tumor expression of pPTEN was not associated with immunoreactivity against VEGF when the same areas were considered. In conclusion, loss of PTEN expression is frequent in high-grade astrocytomas, but not in grade 2 tumors, and correlates with PTEN deletion and loss of chromosome 10. PTEN immunoreactivity does not correlate with VEGF expression in astrocytomas when similar areas are considered.
PDE10A is a newly identified cAMP/cGMP phosphodiesterase for which mRNA is highly expressed in the mammalian striatum. In the present study, PDE10A protein and mRNA expression throughout the rat brain were determined, using a monoclonal antibody (24F3.F11) for Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses and an antisense riboprobe for in situ hybridization. High levels of mRNA are observed in most of the neuronal cell bodies of striatal complex (caudate n, n. accumbens and olfactory tubercle), indicating that PDE10A is expressed by the striatal medium spiny neurons. PDE10A-like immunoreactivity is dense throughout the striatal neuropil, as well as in the internal capsule, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra. These latter regions lack significant expression of PDE10A mRNA. Thus, PDE10A is transported throughout the dendritic tree and down the axons to the terminals of the medium spiny neurons. These data suggest a role for PDE10A in regulating activity within both the striatonigral and striatopallidal pathways. In addition, PDE10A immunoreactivity and mRNA are found at lower levels in the hippocampal pyramidal cell layer, dentate granule cell layer and throughout the cortex and cerebellar granule cell layer. Immunoreactivity is detected only in cell bodies in these latter regions. This more restricted subcellular localization of PDE10A outside the striatum suggests a second, distinct function for the enzyme in these regions.
ABO blood groups were determined in 404 patients who had cardiac surgery for heart disease; 136 of these patients had rheumatic valvular heart disease and 268 had congenital heart disease. The incidence of each ABO blood group was compared to a control series of 2171 patients by means of the varkappa(2) test. There was no statistical difference in the incidence of ABO blood group when patients with congenital and rheumatic valvular heart disease were compared with the control group.
CA1 pyramidal neurons degenerate after transient forebrain ischemia, whereas neurons in other regions of the hippocampus remain intact. Here we show that in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons, forebrain ischemia induces the phosphorylation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 2A subunit at Ser1232 (phospho-Ser1232). Ser1232 phosphorylation is catalyzed by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Inhibiting endogenous Cdk5, or perturbing interactions between Cdk5 and NR2A subunits, abolished NR2A phosphorylation at Ser1232 and protected CA1 pyramidal neurons from ischemic insult. Thus, we conclude that modulation of NMDA receptors by Cdk5 is the primary intracellular event underlying the ischemic injury of CA1 pyramidal neurons.
CD38 is expressed on the surface of leukemic cells in a significant percentage of patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). From the literature it is known that CD38 expression has prognostic value in CLL, suggesting an association between CD38 expression and the mutational status of IgV genes. Peripheral blood samples from 82 patients with CLL were analyzed by flow cytometry for CD38 expression on CD19+ leukemic cells. CD38 was expressed in 30% or more of leukemic cells in 26 patients (patients with 30% or more B cells coexpressing CD19/CD38 were considered positive). Seven of the 26 patients with high CD38 expression and eight of the 56 patients with low CD38 expression had advanced-stage disease (RAI III-IV). Higher than 4 mg/l levels of beta 2-microglobulin was measured in the serum of nine of 26 CD38+ and seven of 56 CD38- patients. Our analyses showed that the high CD38 expression is associated with other risk factors, identifying an aggressive disease, which require treatment. It will be important to conduct further studies to establish the prognostic value of the high CD38 expression in early-stage disease.
ABCG5 (G5) and ABCG8 (G8) are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that limit intestinal absorption and promote biliary excretion of neutral sterols. Mutations in either ABCG5 or ABCG8 result in an identical clinical phenotype, suggesting that these two half-transporters function as heterodimers. Expression of both G5 and G8 is required for either protein to be transported to the plasma membrane of cultured cells. In this paper we used immunofluorescence microscopy to confirm, in vivo, that G5 is localized to the apical membranes of mouse enterocytes and hepatocytes. Other ABC half-transporters function as homodimers or as heterodimers with other subfamily members. To determine whether G5 or G8 complex with other ABCG half-transporters, we co-expressed G1, G2, and G4 with either G5 or G8 in cultured cells. G1, G2, and G4 co-immunoprecipitated with G5, and G4 co-immunoprecipitated with G8, but the putative dimers were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Adenovirus-mediated expression of either G5 or G8 in the liver of G5G8 null mice resulted in ER retention of the expressed proteins and no increase in biliary cholesterol. In contrast, co-expression of G5 and G8 resulted in transit of the proteins out of the ER and a 10-fold increase in biliary cholesterol concentration. Finally, adenoviral expression of G2 in the presence or absence of G5 or G8 failed to promote sterol excretion into bile. These experiments indicate that G5 and G8 function as obligate heterodimers to promote sterol excretion into bile.
NQO1 is an antioxidant enzyme, important in the detoxification of environmental carcinogens. A single nucleotide polymorphism (C-->T) at position 609 of the NQO1 cDNA has been associated with susceptibility to tumours induced by chemical carcinogens. In our case-control study, we determined the prevalence of the C609T NQO1 polymorphism by PCR-RFLP analysis in Caucasian patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC; n=61), cardiac adenocarcinoma (CAC; n=120) or gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC; n=203) vs. a control group that consisted of 252 healthy blood donors. Additionally, NQO1 mRNA expression and NQO1 protein expression were determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in a subset of cases. The NQO1 C609T genotype distribution was significantly different among controls (C/C, 73.4%; C/T, 25.0%; T/T, 1.6%) as compared to OAC patients (C/C, 49.2%; C/T, 47.5%; T/T, 3.3%; p=0.0004), CAC patients (C/C, 55.8%; C/T, 40.0%; T/T, 4.2%; p=0.0005) and with GAC patients (C/C, 65.5%; C/T; 30.6%, T/T; 3.9%; p=0.0377). The 609T allele overall frequency was 0.141 in controls, 0.270 in OAC patients, 0.241 in CAC patients and 0.192 in GAC patients. Individuals carrying 1 or 2 609T alleles had a 2.85-fold higher risk (95% CI: 1.61-5.07; p=0.0003) for the development of OAC and a 2.18-fold higher risk (95% CI: 1.38-3.44; p=0.0007) for the development of CAC than wild-type gene homozygotes. Immunohistochemical analysis showed NQO1 protein expression in 133 carcinomas, whereas 17 carcinomas were negative. Negativity for NQO1 protein expression correlated strongly with the NQO1 genotype being present in 3.9% of cases with C/C, 13.9% of cases with C/T and 62.5% of cases with T/T genotype (p<0.001). In contrast, NQO1 mRNA expression was detectable irrespective of underlying genotype. In conclusion, determination of the NQO1 genotype may gain importance as a stratification marker in future prevention trials for adenocarcinoma of upper gastrointestinal tract.
ARG1 (ALTERED RESPONSE TO GRAVITY) is required for normal root and hypocotyl gravitropism. Here, we show that targeting ARG1 to the gravity-perceiving cells of roots or hypocotyls is sufficient to rescue the gravitropic defects in the corresponding organs of arg1-2 null mutants. The cytosolic alkalinization of root cap columella cells that normally occurs very rapidly upon gravistimulation is lacking in arg1-2 mutants. Additionally, vertically grown arg1-2 roots appear to accumulate a greater amount of auxin in an expanded domain of the root cap compared with the wild type, and no detectable lateral auxin gradient develops across mutant root caps in response to gravistimulation. We also demonstrate that ARG1 is a peripheral membrane protein that may share some subcellular compartments in the vesicular trafficking pathway with PIN auxin efflux carriers. These data support our hypothesis that ARG1 is involved early in gravitropic signal transduction within the gravity-perceiving cells, where it influences pH changes and auxin distribution. We propose that ARG1 affects the localization and/or activity of PIN or other proteins involved in lateral auxin transport.
CYP2B6 metabolizes many drugs, and its expression varies greatly. CYP2B6 genotype-phenotype associations were determined using human livers that were biochemically phenotyped for CYP2B6 (mRNA, protein, and CYP2B6 activity), and genotyped for CYP2B6 coding and 5'-flanking regions. CYP2B6 expression differed significantly between sexes. Females had higher amounts of CYP2B6 mRNA (3.9-fold, P < 0.001), protein (1.7-fold, P < 0.009), and activity (1.6-fold, P < 0.05) than did male subjects. Furthermore, 7.1% of females and 20% of males were poor CYP2B6 metabolizers. Striking differences among different ethnic groups were observed: CYP2B6 activity was 3.6- and 5.0-fold higher in Hispanic females than in Caucasian (P < 0.022) or African-American females (P < 0.038). Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP2B6 promoter and seven in the coding region were found, including a newly identified 13072A>G substitution that resulted in an Lys139Glu change. Many CYP2B6 splice variants (SV) were observed, and the most common variant lacked exons 4 to 6. A nonsynonymous SNP in exon 4 (15631G>T), which disrupted an exonic splicing enhancer, and a SNP 15582C>T in an intron-3 branch site were correlated with this SV. The extent to which CYP2B6 variation was a predictor of CYP2B6 activity varied according to sex and ethnicity. The 1459C>T SNP, which resulted in the Arg487Cys substitution, was associated with the lowest level of CYP2B6 activity in livers of females. The intron-3 15582C>T SNP (in significant linkage disequilibrium with a SNP in a putative hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) binding site) was correlated with lower CYP2B6 expression in females. In conclusion, we found several common SNPs that are associated with polymorphic CYP2B6 expression.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is a tumor suppressor gene, mutated frequently in a variety of human tumors. PTEN regulates cell growth, apoptosis, and proliferation. Phosphorylation in PTEN tail causes its inactivation and decreases its degradation. There is little known about the regulation of PTEN by ovarian steroids. We hypothesized that PTEN expression in human endometrium is variable throughout the menstrual cycle and early pregnancy, and that ovarian steroids regulate PTEN expression because PTEN is critical in many steroid-sensitive tissues such as endometrium, prostate, and breast. In the present study, we have observed a direct regulation of PTEN by ovarian steroids. Estradiol increased PTEN phosphorylation at 5-15 min. After 24-h treatment, progesterone induced a significant increase in PTEN protein levels, assessed by Western blot. Furthermore, we evaluated for the first time a comparison between menstrual cycle and early pregnancy, immunohistochemically. Endometrial PTEN expression revealed temporal and spatial changes throughout the menstrual cycle and during early pregnancy. We conclude that estradiol may down-regulate PTEN activity by increasing its phosphorylation, but progesterone is likely to regulate the PTEN pool by decreasing its phosphorylation and increasing its protein level. Presented data, therefore, suggest that ovarian steroids regulate the endometrial PTEN pool. We propose that PTEN might be one of the signaling proteins that estrogen and progesterone are acting to affect endometrial cell proliferation and/or apoptosis.
CYP1B1 has been evaluated as a candidate gene for various cancers because of its function in activating environmental procarcinogens and catalysing the conversion of oestrogens to genotoxic catechol oestrogens. To test the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms in the CYP1B1 gene may associate with the risk for prostate cancer (CaP), we compared the allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies of 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP1B1 among 159 hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) probands, 245 sporadic CaP cases, and 222 unaffected men. When each of the SNPs was analysed separately, marginally significant differences were observed for allele frequencies between sporadic cases and controls for three consecutive SNPs (-1001C/T, -263G/A, and -13C/T, P=0.04-0.07). Similarly, marginally significant differences between sporadic cases and controls in the frequency of variant allele carriers were observed for five consecutive SNPs (-1001C/T, -263G/A, -13C/T, +142C/G, and +355G/T, P=0.02-0.08). Interestingly, when the combination of these five SNPs was analysed using a haplotype approach, a larger difference was found (P=0.009). One frequent haplotype (C-G-C-C-G of -1001C/T, -263G/A, -13C/T, +142C/G, and +355G/T) was associated with an increased risk for CaP, while the other frequent haplotype (T-A-T-G-T) was associated with a decreased risk for CaP. These findings suggest that genetic polymorphisms in CYP1B1 may modify the risk for CaP.
PC from colorectal cancer is a terminal illness for which intravenous chemotherapy is the current standard treatment. However, a recent Dutch randomized study established the efficacy of maximal cytoreductive surgery plus IPCH to achieve statistically significant prolonged survival of these patients. In the near future, improvements of IPCH techniques and progress in selecting patients by radiologic imaging, by molecular biologic studies or further refinement of quantitative prognostic indicators will permit better results. Prospective studies must be conducted in the prevention of carcinomatosis in well-defined high-risk patients.
CYP2E1 induction by ethanol is one mechanism by which ethanol creates oxidative stress in the liver. The superoxide dismutases (SODs) are an important antioxidant enzyme defense system against reactive oxygen species (ROS). To investigate the protective role of SOD against CYP2E1-dependent toxicity, a transfected HepG2 cell line overexpressing CYP2E1 (E47 cells) was infected with adenoviral vectors containing Cu/Zn-SOD complementary DNA (cDNA) (Ad.SOD1) and Mn-SOD cDNA (Ad.SOD2). Forty-eight hours after infection, intracellular levels and activity of Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD were increased about 2- and 3-fold, respectively. Localization of the overexpressed Cu/Zn-SOD in the cytosol and Mn-SOD in the mitochondria was confirmed by assaying the levels and activity of SOD in the corresponding isolated fractions. Arachidonic acid (AA) plus iron-induced cell death was partially prevented in both Ad.SOD1- and Ad.SOD2-infected E47 cells. Overexpression of Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD also partially protected E47 cells from the increase in reactive oxygen production and lipid peroxidation and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential induced by AA and iron. Infection with Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD also protected the E47 cells against AA toxicity or buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)-dependent toxicity. CYP2E1 levels and catalytic activity were not altered by overexpression of Cu/Zn-SOD or Mn-SOD. Cu/Zn-SOD in the cytosol and Mn-SOD in mitochondria each are capable of protecting HepG2 cells expressing CYP2E1 against cytotoxicity induced by pro-oxidants. In conclusion, these enzymes may be useful in the prevention or improvement of liver injury produced by agents known to be metabolized by CYP2E1 to reactive intermediates and to cause oxidative stress.
ABCG2 (BCRP) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of cell surface transport proteins. ABCG2 expression occurs in a variety of normal tissues, and is relatively limited to primitive stem cells. ABCG2 expression is associated with the side population (SP) phenotype of Hoechst 33342 efflux. The substrate profile of ABCG2 includes the antineoplastic drugs primarily targeting topoisomerases, including anthracyclines and camptothecins. More recently, pheophorbide, a chlorophyll-breakdown product, and protoporhyrin IX have been described as ABCG2 substrates, perhaps indicating a physiologic role of cytoprotection of primitive cells. Also, mice lacking ABCG2 expression have no intrinsic stem cell defects, although there is a remarkable increase in toxicity with antineoplastic drugs that are ABCG2 substrates, and also a photosensitivity resembling protoporphyria. Like other members of the ABC family, such as MDR1 and MRP1, ABCG2 is expressed in a variety of malignancies. Despite numerous reports of ABCG2 expression in AML, there is little evidence that ABCG2 expression is correlated with an adverse clinical outcome. This review will focus on the potential usefulness of ABCG2 as a marker primitive stem cells and possible physiologic roles of ABCG2 in protection of primitive stem cell populations, and potential methods of overcoming ABCG2-associated drug resistance in anticancer therapy.
SPR techniques can provide a wealth of insight into the nature of protein-carbohydrate interactions. Information not obtained readily by other methodologies can be gathered relatively quickly in a label-free manner with low sample consumption. This chapter focused on two applications in which SPR has been used to map conformational epitopes on bacterial polysaccharides recognized by protective antibodies. In one example, methods for demonstrating the conformational nature of the epitope recognized by an anti-GBS antibody were described. Dramatic epitopic stabilization at 2 repeating units with further significant stabilization between 7 and 20 repeating units was demonstrated. In a second example, SPR methods were employed in characterization of the epitope recognized by a protective antibody against the group B meningococcus. It was shown that the antibody bound a long epitope, in excess of eight monosaccharides and probably helical, on NPr-GBMP but did not bind to GBMP. The binding of the protective antibody to GBMP only when GBMP is cell associated, or with an attached lipid, indicated that the protective GBM epitope consists of more than GBMP. NPr-GBMP mimics a cell surface complex consisting of extended helical portions of the GBMP in association with a second molecule, possibly a phosphoglycerolipid. SPR experiments indicated that the protective nature of certain antibodies induced by the NPr-GBMP vaccine is attributable to their recognition of an abundant internal epitope on NPr-GBMP and cell-associated GBMP. A nonprotective antibody, specific for NPr-GBMP, recognized a terminal and consequently minor epitope on the polysaccharide. Low levels of this nonprotective antibody binding to cells and unpurified polysaccharide confirmed recognition of a minor epitope on the natural antigen as well. In contrast, a protective antibody exhibited a high level of binding to the cell-associated antigen.
CD38 is a multifunctional ectoenzyme that catalyses formation of cyclic ADP ribose (cADPr), a second messenger that opens ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca2+ channels. Despite its importance in signal transduction processes, little is known about the mechanisms regulating CD38 expression levels. In the current study, ryanodine stimulation of Ca2+ release in Namalwa cells decreased both CD38 protein abundance and cyclase activity. Reductions in cyclase activity were prevented by RyR antagonists, by lysosomal blockers, though not by calpain or proteasomal inhibitors. These findings indicate a novel negative feedback mechanism between RyR channel activity and CD38 abundance acts in cADPr signal transduction.
PTEN is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in a variety of malignant tumors, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). PTEN regulates cell cycle progression and cell survival in vivo. However, the role of PTEN alterations and their association with tumor growth and behavior in patients with RCC has not been well established. The aim of our study was to evaluate PTEN expression in RCC and its correlation with clinicopathologic features, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.
ACE inhibitors and ARA are for the nephrologist two completely unique classes of antihypertensive agents as they offer the opportunity to control microalbuminuria, proteinuria and slow the progression of renal diseases. These properties have mainly been studied in type 1 and type 2 diabetics but can be extended to a wide range of renal diseases. The renal effects of the two classes of compounds differ but the clinical significance of these differences remains to be ascertained.
NSF and p97 are related AAA proteins implicated in membrane trafficking and organelle biogenesis. p97 is also involved in pathways that lead to ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, including ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In this study, we have used dominant interfering ATP-hydrolysis deficient mutants (NSF(E329Q) and p97(E578Q)) to compare the function of these AAA proteins in the secretory pathway of mammalian cells. Expressing NSF(E329Q) promotes disassembly of Golgi stacks into dispersed vesicular structures. It also rapidly inhibits glycosaminoglycan sulfation, reflecting disruption of intra-Golgi transport. In contrast, expressing p97(E578Q) does not affect Golgi structure or function; glycosaminoglycans are normally sulfated and secreted, as is the VSV-G ts045 protein. Instead, expression of p97(E578Q) causes ubiquitinated proteins to accumulate on ER membranes and slows degradation of the ERAD substrate cystic-fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator. In addition, expression of p97(E578Q) eventually causes the ER to swell. More specific assessment of effects of p97(E578Q) on organelle assembly shows that the Golgi apparatus disperses and reassembles normally after treatment with brefeldin A and during mitosis. These findings demonstrate that ATP-hydrolysis-dependent activities of NSF and p97 in the cell are not equivalent and suggest that only NSF is directly involved in regulating membrane fusion.
EXTL3 encodes alpha1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases I and II enzymes, which are involved in chain initiation and elongation of heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesis. HS proteoglycans are critically involved in a variety of biological phenomena at various levels of complexity in adult and embryonic lives. Dedicated functions of HS proteoglycans are due to variable HS chains that interact with different cellular proteins, and can be regulated by their synthesizing enzymes. EXTL3 protein is also a putative receptor for Reg protein, a growth signal mediator for the beta-cells of the pancreas. The present Northern blot analysis revealed two EXTL3 transcripts (6.2 and 3.4 kb), which were differentially expressed in different mouse adult tissues. The strongest expression was in the adult brain and pancreas. In the adult pancreas, a comparable intensity of both signals was detected. In the embryonic pancreas, the longer transcript was predominant, and showed a biphasic expression pattern with a peak at E11.5, whereas the shorter one showed a steady level of expression throughout the whole period of pancreatic development. By in situ hybridization, the acini of adults and embryos were strong positive for EXTL3 mRNA. Mature islets of Langerhans gave a weak signal, whereas the developing islets showed moderately positive reaction albeit less intense than the acini. In situ hybridization revealed a wide and differential expression pattern of EXTL3 mRNA in embryonic tissues. At the early stages, intense reaction was found in the developing neurons of the brain and spinal cord and in the epithelia of the developing GIT, pancreas, liver and kidney of embryos. Our data suggested that EXTL3 expression is developmentally regulated, and may contribute to the regulated production of HS in different adult and embryonic tissues.
CYP3A5 expression is regulated by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The CYP3A5 genotype might contribute to a marked interindividual variation in CYP3A-mediated metabolism of drugs. Nifedipine is a typical substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 in vitro. The aim of this study was to elucidate the influence of the CYP3A5 genotype on nifedipine disposition in healthy subjects. A single capsule containing 10 mg of nifedipine was administered to 16 healthy male Japanese subjects (eight subjects: CYP3A5(*)1/(*)3; eight subjects: CYP3A5(*)3/(*)3). Blood samples were collected to analyze the pharmacokinetics of serum nifedipine and nitropyridine metabolite (M-I). The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), the peak plasma concentration (C(max)) and the terminal half-life (t(1/2)) of nifedipine, and the ratio of the nifedipine AUC to M-I AUC showed large intragroup variations, but no significant differences between the two genotypes. Based on the present findings, the functional relevance of CYP3A5 polymorphism should be re-evaluated in clinical trials.
PTEN is a novel tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosomal band 10q23. Loss of PTEN function has been implicated in the progression of several types of cancer, but the correlation between loss of PTEN expression and advanced carcinomas is not well established. The capacity for angiogenesis of a tumor is known to play a very important role in growth and metastasis, and there have been reports that PTEN relates to angiogenesis. In the present study, formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tissues from 101 patients with breast carcinomas, including 88 cases of invasive ductal carcinomas and 13 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), were evaluated by immunohistochemical methods for the expression of PTEN and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as well as microvessel density (MVD). The results were compared with the clinicopathologic parameters. There was no loss of PTEN expression in any of the cases of DCIS, but 28 (32%) of the 88 invasive cases did not express PTEN. Loss of PTEN expression was associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.03), but did not correlate with tumor size, tumor grade, MVD or recurrence. VEGF expression significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis in invasive ductal carcinoma (P = 0.01). There was no correlation between the expression of PTEN and that of VEGF (P = 0.63). The present study suggests that loss of PTEN expression is common and correlates with tumor progression and lymph node metastasis in breast carcinoma. The relationship between loss of PTEN and progression of breast cancer may not be explained by modulation of angiogenesis.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that inhibits cell proliferation by regulating intracellular signaling pathways, and this activity can be abolished by mutations of the PTEN gene. This study was designed to examine the correlation of PTEN expression with the expression of cell cycle regulators and with clinicopathological parameters in endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus.
CYP3A4 exhibits unusual kinetic characteristics that result from the metabolism of multiple substrate including endogenous steroids and some drugs that coexist at the active site. To clarify the mechanism of the effect of endogenous steroids on the drug metabolism, the interaction between substrates, nevirapine (NVP) and carbamazepine (CBZ), and endogenous steroids was investigated by theoretical calculations. When the activities of NVP 2-hydroxylation and CBZ 10,11-epoxidation by expressed CYP3A4 were measured in the presence of steroids, NVP 2-hydroxylation was found to be remarkably increased by aldosterone and inhibited by estradiol. CBZ 10,11-epoxidation was increased by androstenedione. Three-dimensional computer modeling has shown that the active site of CYP3A4 is especially large, permitting access of two substrate molecules. The interactions between NVP and aldosterone and between CBZ and androstenedione were estimated by theoretical calculations assuming the substrate and steroids to be present in the active site at the same time. It was shown that NVP or CBZ would be stably fixed close to the oxygen atom at the sixth ligand of heme by interaction with steroids, suggesting that NVP and CBZ may be hydroxylated more easily due to the interaction with steroids. Estradiol was also expected to interact with NVP via a pi/pi interaction between a benzene ring, in which the NVP hydroxylation site is located, and a benzene ring of estradiol, suggested to inhibit the reaction. From these results, interactions between the substrate and endogenous steroids in the active site may change the activity of CYP3A4.
CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 are two of the main cytochrome P450 isoforms involved in the metabolism of commonly used drugs and xenobiotic compounds considered to be responsible for or possible participants in the development of several human diseases. Individual susceptibility to developing these pathologies relies, among other factors, on genetic polymorphism which depends on ethnic differences, as the frequency of mutant genotypes varies in different human populations. Thus the aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of CYP1A2 5'-flanking region and CYP2E1 Rsa I/Pst I polymorphisms in Mexicans by PCR-RFLP methods. The DNA of 159 subjects was analysed and mutant allele frequencies of 30% for CYP2E1 Rsa I/Pst I sites and 43% for CYP1A2 5'-flanking region were found. These frequencies are higher than those previously reported for other human populations.
PTEN is a lipid phosphatase, and PTEN mutations are associated with gliomas, macrocephaly, and mental deficiencies. We have used PTEN +/- and PTEN +/+ mice to prepare subventricular zone (SVZ) precursor cells. Using DNA microarrays, we compared the expression profiles of PTEN +/+ and PTEN +/- cells and identified 91 differentially expressed genes in PTEN +/- precursor cells. Many of the PTEN-regulated genes are involved with signaling, cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, metabolism, and transcription factors. Some of these changes are likely mediated by the transcription factor, HIF-1. We confirmed a subset of these changes by real-time PCR. In addition, we examined protein levels for two of the PTEN-up-regulated genes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and doublecortin (DCX). PTEN haploinsufficiency increases immunostaining for VEGF for both cultured precursor cells and sections of the SVZ. PTEN haploinsufficiency shifted most of the DCX-positive cells from the SVZ to the olfactory bulb. These observations indicate that even a small decrease in PTEN levels results in substantial changes in gene expression and precursor cell function.
PTEN is a dual protein and lipid phosphatase that dephosphorylates PIP3 at the 3' position, thereby antagonizing PI3-kinase activity. A reduction in PI3' kinase activity enhances the susceptibility of cells to apoptosis. By stably transfecting PC12 cells with an antisense PTEN construct, endogenous PTEN protein levels were reduced by approximately 50% and etoposide-induced apoptosis was markedly decreased. Furthermore, IGF-I receptor abrogation of this apoptotic effect was inhibited by both PI3' kinase and by specific inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase. Thus, we show for the first time that p38 MAP kinase is involved in this process.
CD38 is an ectoenzyme with ADP-ribosyl cyclase and hydrolase activities, which synthesizes cyclic ADP-ribose from NAD and hydrolyzes cyclic ADP-ribose to ADP-ribose. It has been shown that cyclic ADP-ribose is a potent Ca(2+) mobilizing messenger in many cells. To know the physiological role of cyclic ADP-ribose in vascular smooth muscle, we examined the effects of various agonists in the aorta isolated from CD38 knockout (CD38(-/-)) mouse. Western blot analysis showed that CD38 protein was detected in the aorta isolated from wild-type (CD38(+/+)) mouse, but not from CD38(-/-) mouse. In the aortae isolated from both CD38(+/+) and CD38(-/-) mice, KCl, phenylephrine and norepinephrine induced concentration-dependent contraction. KCl produced similar concentration-dependent responses in the aortae from both CD38(+/+) and CD38(-/-) mice. Maximum force of contraction induced by KCl (65 mM) was same in the size. Phenylephrine- and norepinephrine-induced contractions were, however, significantly smaller in the aortae from CD38(-/-) mice than in those from CD38(+/+) mice. 5-Hydroxytryptamine, endothelin-1, caffeine and thapsigargin-induced contractions were not significantly different in these two aortae. These results suggest that CD38 gene disruption inhibits alpha-adrenoceptor-induced vascular contractions and cyclic ADP-ribose-mediated signal transduction system is committed in these responses.
"COMT inhibitors have historically been used as adjuncts to levodopa in fluctuating PD patients to increase ""on"" time and reduce ""off"" time. Evidence that motor complications are related to intermittent or pulsatile stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors has led to the use of long-acting dopaminergic therapies that provide more continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS). CDS-based therapies are associated with the prevention and reversal of levodopa-related motor complications in MPTP-lesioned primates and PD patients. However, levodopa remains the most effective and widely used anti-parkinsonian agent and is eventually required in all PD patients. The standard oral formulation of levodopa has a relatively short half-life and is associated with the development of motor complications when used as either initial or supplemental therapy. The CDS concept raises the possibility that administration of levodopa in combination with a COMT inhibitor to extend its half-life might reduce the risk of inducing motor complications. This article considers the possibility that combining levodopa with entacapone may prevent or reverse motor complications."
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten), a novel tumor suppressor gene identified recently, is called the house-keeping gene of endometrium. However, little is known about its precise role in genesis and development of endometrial carcinoma. In the present study, the mutation and protein expression of PTEN gene were investigated to seek the clinical significance.
ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) mediates the release of cellular cholesterol and phospholipid to form high density lipoprotein. Functions of ABCA1 are highly regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and the synthesized ABCA1 protein turns over rapidly with a half-life of 1-2 h. To examine whether the functions of ABCA1 are modulated by associated proteins, a yeast two-hybrid library was screened with the C-terminal 120 amino acids of ABCA1. Two PDZ (PSD95-Discs large-ZO1) proteins, alpha1-syntrophin and Lin7, were found to interact with ABCA1. Immunoprecipitation revealed that alpha1-syntrophin interacted with ABCA1 strongly and that the interaction was via the C-terminal three amino acids SYV of ABCA1. Co-expression of alpha1-syntrophin in human embryonic kidney 293 cells retarded degradation of ABCA1 and made the half-life of ABCA1 five times longer than in the cells not expressing alpha1-syntrophin. This effect is not common among PDZ-containing proteins interacting with ABCA1, because Lin7, which was also found to interact with the C terminus region of ABCA1, did not have a significant effect on the half-life of ABCA1. Co-expression of alpha1-syntrophin significantly increased the apoA-I-mediated release of cholesterol. ABCA1 was co-immunoprecipitated with alpha1-syntrophin from mouse brain. These results suggest that alpha1-syntrophin is involved in intracellular signaling, which determines the stability of ABCA1 and modulates cellular cholesterol release.
CBS domains are defined as sequence motifs that occur in several different proteins in all kingdoms of life. Although thought to be regulatory, their exact functions have been unknown. However, their importance was underlined by findings that mutations in conserved residues within them cause a variety of human hereditary diseases, including (with the gene mutated in parentheses): Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase); retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1); congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members); and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase). AMP-activated protein kinase is a sensor of cellular energy status that is activated by AMP and inhibited by ATP, but the location of the regulatory nucleotide-binding sites (which are prime targets for drugs to treat obesity and diabetes) was not characterized. We now show that tandem pairs of CBS domains from AMP-activated protein kinase, IMP dehydrogenase-2, the chloride channel CLC2, and cystathionine beta-synthase bind AMP, ATP, or S-adenosyl methionine,while mutations that cause hereditary diseases impair this binding. This shows that tandem pairs of CBS domains act, in most cases, as sensors of cellular energy status and, as such, represent a newly identified class of binding domain for adenosine derivatives.
CYP2D6 drug-metabolising enzyme has been shown to be involved in fluoxetine metabolism in vitro and in vivo. CYP2C9 has also been shown to influence the metabolism of fluoxetine in vitro; however, this relationship has not been studied in humans. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 genotypes on the plasma concentration of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine in psychiatric patients during steady-state conditions.
ACE inhibitors have been used extensively in the management of patients with hypertension and heart failure. Over the past decade, a large body of evidence has emerged indicating that ACE inhibition also favorably affects the vasculature, and that these effects are associated with improved patient outcomes. Such evidence is provided by several sources: (i) experimental studies, which demonstrate that in addition to blood pressure lowering, ACE inhibitors improve endothelial function and have a host of other beneficial effects on the arterial wall; (ii) epidemiologic studies, which link the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to increased risk for myocardial infarction, and (iii) clinical trials, which demonstrate that treatment with these agents reduces the risk for acute ischemic events, improves the function of the arterial endothelium and can retard the progression of the anatomic extent of atherosclerosis.
ACE inhibitors induce metabolic changes and exert cardioprotective and vasoprotective properties, some of which cannot be attributed to their antihypertensive effect per se. Moexipril is an ACE inhibitor with a lipophilicity in the same range as quinapril, benazepril or ramipril, and so can readily penetrate lipid membranes and thus target tissue ACE in addition to plasma ACE. Evidence from animal studies shows similar and significant (p < 0.05) reductions in tissue ACE activity for moexipril and quinapril. Moexipril may improve endothelial dysfunction; moexiprilat and ramiprilat have demonstrated greater activity than captopril, enalaprilat and quinaprilat in isolated endothelium-denuded segments of the rabbit jugular vein where bradykinin elicits a constrictor response, mediated by activation of the bradykinin B(2) receptor. ACE inhibitors, including moexipril, may exert neuroprotective effects. Moexipril promoted neuronal survival in vitro and it is thought that this neuroprotective effect is due to free radical scavenging properties of the drug. ACE inhibitors can also decrease progression of renal insufficiency in patients with various underlying renal diseases. Moexipril may also have a renoprotective effect as it increased the ultrafiltration coefficient and normalized urinary protein excretion in rat models. Preclinical studies indicate that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may play a role in the regulation of bone resorption and moexipril had no adverse effects on bone metabolism in animal models and the drug did not hamper the osteoprotective effects of estrogen. Reduction in left ventricular mass with moexipril in patients with hypertension was similar in magnitude to the effect of other ACE inhibitors. When investigated in hypertensive patients with an elevated cardiovascular risk, moexipril increased arterial distensibility and demonstrated antioxidative properties in addition to efficiently controlling blood pressure. Moexipril does not adversely affect serum levels of uric acid, lipids, blood glucose levels and plasma insulin levels and can be co-administered with hormone replacement therapy. Moreover, quality-of-life data suggest favorable effects of moexipril treatment in a patient population at high cardiovascular risk.
CS (calsequestrin) is an acidic glycoprotein of the SR (sarcoplasmic reticulum) lumen and plays a crucial role in the storage of Ca2+ and in excitation-contraction coupling of skeletal muscles. CS is synthesized in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) and is targeted to the TC (terminal cisternae) of SR via mechanisms still largely unknown, but probably involving vesicle transport through the Golgi complex. In the present study, two mutant forms of Sar1 and ARF1 (ADP-ribosylation factor 1) were used to disrupt cargo exit from ER-exit sites and intra-Golgi trafficking in skeletal-muscle fibres respectively. Co-expression of Sar1-H79G (His79-->Gly) and recombinant, epitope-tagged CS, CSHA1 (where HA1 stands for nine-amino-acid epitope of the viral haemagglutinin 1), barred segregation of CSHA1 to TC. On the other hand, expression of ARF1-N126I altered the subcellular localization of GM130, a cis -medial Golgi protein in skeletal-muscle fibres and myotubes, without interfering with CSHA1 targeting to either TC or developing SR. Thus active budding from ER-exit sites appears to be involved in CS targeting and routing, but these processes are insensitive to modification of intracellular vesicle trafficking and Golgi complex disruption caused by the mutant ARF1-N126I. It also appears that CS routing from ER to SR does not involve classical secretory pathways through ER-Golgi intermediate compartments, cis -medial Golgi and trans -Golgi network.
GPI anchorage in the CEA family results in the acquisition of radically different functions relative to TM anchorage, including inhibition of differentiation and anoikis, disruption of tissue architecture and promotion of tumorigenicity. CEA GPI anchors, as determined by the carboxy-terminal exon of CEA, demonstrate biological specificity in their ability to confer these functional changes. CEA family GPI anchorage appears to have evolved twice independently during the primate radiation, in a manner suggestive of evolution from more primitive TM-anchored CEACAM1. We show here that very few mutations in the TM exon of present-day human CEACAM1 are required to give efficient GPI anchorage and the biological specificity of CEA GPI anchors, i.e., to give the differentiation-blocking function of GPI-anchored CEA. Such a change in anchorage could therefore represent a relatively facile means for producing radical change in molecular function of Ig superfamily members during evolution.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently mutated in human tumors. It functions primarily as a lipid phosphatase and plays a key role in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase. PTEN appears to play a crucial role in modulating apoptosis by reducing the levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, a phospholipid that activates AKT, a central regulator of apoptosis. To understand the role of PTEN in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, we stably overexpressed PTEN in PC3 cells, which are prostate cancer cells that lack PTEN. Overexpression of PTEN in two different clones inhibited cell proliferation and increased serum starvation-induced apoptosis, as compared to control cells. Interestingly, PTEN overexpression resulted in a 44-60% reduction in total insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) protein levels and a 49-64% reduction in cell surface IGF-IR expression. [35S]methionine pulse experiments in PC3 cells overexpressing PTEN demonstrated that these cells synthesize significantly lower levels of the IGF-IR precursor, whereas PTEN overexpression had no effect on IGF-IR degradation. Taken together, our results show that PTEN can regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis through inhibition of IGF-IR synthesis. These results have important implications for understanding the roles of PTEN and the IGF-IR in prostate cancer cell tumorigenesis.
CYP2A6 metabolizes coumarin to 7-hydroxycoumarin showing fluorescence, as measured by fluorometry. Firstly, we measured the inhibition of coumarin 7-hydroxylase of cDNA-expressed human CYP2A6 and in bovine liver microsomes, by quinoline and fluoroquinolines (FQ). Quinoline, 5-FQ, 6-FQ and 8-FQ inhibited activity but 3-FQ showed little inhibition. This suggests that the position 3 of quinoline is a recognition site for CYP2A6. We found similar patterns of coumarin 7-hydroxylase activity with human pooled liver microsomes. The level of CYP2A6 in human and bovine microsomes is the same as that detected by immunological titration with monoclonal antibody against CYP2A6. Secondly, we studied the inhibition of CYP2A6 with clinically used drugs of quinoline compounds, such as norfloxacin as an antibacterial agent, quinidine as an antiarrhythmic agent, quinine and chloroquine as antimalaria agents and rebamipide as an anti-ulcer agent. IC50 values (concentration producing 50% inhibition in activity) of norfloxacin, rebamipide and chloroquine at mM concentrations showed them to possess almost no inhibitory activity or influence on drug interaction. Meanwhile, the IC50 value of quinidine was 1.12 mM. The IC50 value of quinine was 160 microM with weak inhibition, suggesting that quinine, at a high dose, influences the metabolism of substrates for CYP2A6 by drug-drug interaction. These results also show that CYP2A6 discriminates the structure difference between the diastereoisomers quinidine and quinine.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in various advanced human neoplasias, including glioblastomas and prostate, breast, endometrial, and kidney cancers. This tumor suppressor is a lipid phosphatase that negatively regulates cell survival and proliferation mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling. Using the Cre-loxP system, we selectively inactivated Pten in murine tissues in which the MMTV-LTR promoter is active, resulting in hyperproliferation and neoplastic changes in Pten-null skin and prostate. These phenotypes had early onset and were completely penetrant. Abnormalities in Pten mutant skin consisted of mild epidermal hyperplasia, whereas prostates from these mice exhibited high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) that frequently progressed to focally invasive cancer. These data demonstrate that Pten is an important physiological regulator of growth in the skin and prostate. Further, the early onset of HGPIN in Pten mutant males is unique to this animal model and implicates PTEN mutations in the initiation of prostate cancer. Consistent with high PTEN mutation rates in human prostate tumors, these data indicate that PTEN is a critical tumor suppressor in this organ.
CD36 is an important scavenger receptor mediating uptake of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDLs) and plays a key role in foam cell formation and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We report the first evidence that the transcription factor Nrf2 is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, and demonstrate that oxLDLs cause nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 in murine macrophages, resulting in the activation of genes encoding CD36 and the stress proteins A170, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and peroxiredoxin I (Prx I). 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), derived from lipid peroxidation, was one of the most effective activators of Nrf2. Using Nrf2-deficient macrophages, we established that Nrf2 partially regulates CD36 expression in response to oxLDLs, HNE, or the electrophilic agent diethylmaleate. In murine aortic smooth muscle cells, expressing negligible levels of CD36, both moderately and highly oxidized LDL caused only limited Nrf2 translocation and negligible increases in A170, HO-1, and Prx I expression. However, treatment of smooth muscle cells with HNE significantly enhanced nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and increased A170, HO-1, and Prx I protein levels. Because PPAR-gamma can be activated by oxLDLs and controls expression of CD36 in macrophages, our results implicate Nrf2 as a second important transcription factor involved in the induction of the scavenger receptor CD36 and antioxidant stress genes in atherosclerosis.
CLC Cl(-) channels fulfill numerous physiological functions as demonstrated by their involvement in several human genetic diseases. They have an unusual homodimeric architecture in which each subunit forms an individual pore whose open probability is regulated by various physicochemical factors, including voltage, Cl(-) concentration, and pH. The voltage dependence of Torpedo channel CLC-0 is derived probably indirectly from the translocation of a Cl(-) ion through the pore during the opening step. Recent structure determinations of bacterial CLC homologues marked a breakthrough for the structure-function analysis of CLC channels. The structures revealed a complex fold with 18 alpha-helices and two Cl(-) ions per subunit bound in the center of the protein. The side chain of a highly conserved glutamate residue that resides in the putative permeation pathway appears to be a major component of the channel gate. First studies have begun to exploit the bacterial structures as guides for a rational structure-function analysis. These studies confirm that the overall structure seems to be conserved from bacteria to humans. A full understanding of the mechanisms of gating of eukaryotic CLC channels is, however, still lacking.
CYP1B1 metabolites receive particular attention because of their causative role in malignant transformation of various steroid-related organs. Rare variants at residues c.701, c.1294 and c.1358 of CYP1B1 gene result in hyper-activity of protein and can lead to a higher susceptibility to estrogen-related cancers. However, in Japan, the incidences of estrogen-related cancers are remarkably lower than in Western countries. We hypothesize that polymorphisms of CYP1B1 gene can relate to lower incidence of estrogen-related diseases in the Japanese population. To test this hypothesis, the genetic distributions of six different CYP1B1 gene polymorphisms were evaluated among 200 Japanese, 200 Americans and 112 Germans by an allele-specific PCR (ASP) technique. The frequencies of rare variants at residues c.701 and c.1294 were significantly lower in the Japanese population compared to that of other populations. 5.5% of Japanese showed the genotype 701T/T (versus 9.0% in Americans and 10.7% in Germans). 6.5% of Japanese showed the genotype 1294G/G (versus 14.5% in Americans and 12.5% in Germans). The polymorphism at residue c.1358 was not detected in the Japanese population although other populations showed the variant genotypes. This report clearly demonstrates rare variants that correspond to hyper-activity of CYP1B1 protein are significantly 1ess frequent in the Japanese population.
HDC (L-histidine decarboxylase), the enzyme responsible for the catalytic production of histamine from L-histidine, belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of vitamin B6-dependent enzymes known as the group II decarboxylases. Yet despite the obvious importance of histamine, mammalian HDC enzymes remain poorly characterized at both the biochemical and structural levels. By comparison with the recently described crystal structure of the homologous enzyme L-DOPA decarboxylase, we have been able to identify a number of conserved domains and motifs that are important also for HDC catalysis. This includes residues that were proposed to mediate events within the active site, and HDC proteins carrying mutations in these residues were inactive when expressed in reticulocyte cell lysates reactions. Our studies also suggest that a significant change in quartenary structure occurs during catalysis. This involves a protease sensitive loop, and incubating recombinant HDC with an L-histidine substrate analogue altered enzyme structure so that the loop was no longer exposed for tryptic proteolysis. In total, 27 mutant proteins were used to test the proposed importance of 34 different amino acid residues. This is the most extensive mutagenesis study yet to identify catalytically important residues in a mammalian HDC protein sequence and it provides a number of novel insights into the mechanism of histamine biosynthesis.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor protein that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate and antagonizes the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase signaling pathway. We show here that PTEN can also inhibit cell migration through its C2 domain, independent of its lipid phosphatase activity. This activity depends on the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN and on dephosphorylation at a single residue, threonine(383). The ability of PTEN to control cell migration through its C2 domain is likely to be an important feature of its tumor suppressor activity.
ABO types obtained from evidentiary samples have been used effectively to obtain the initial information leading to the apprehension of culprits in Japanese criminal investigations. A simple ABO genotyping method using multiplex sequence-specific PCR and capillary electrophoresis was developed as a supplement to serological ABO typing. Limitations in predicting a phenotype based on genotype were evaluated using 1134 randomly selected Japanese peripheral blood samples. A concordance rate of 99.82% (1132/1134 samples) was found between genotypes and phenotypes defined as Groups A, B, AB, and O. Sequencing analysis revealed that one discrepant sample contained an O allele having a previously unreported point mutation at the primer binding site in exon 6, and another discrepant sample contained an O allele lacking the guanine deletion at nt 261 (the O301 allele). Therefore, the existence of such alleles must be given some consideration when predicting phenotype based on genotype.
PHOSPHO1 is a recently identified phosphatase whose expression is upregulated in mineralizing cells and is implicated in the generation of inorganic phosphate for matrix mineralization, a process central to skeletal development. The enzyme is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of magnesium-dependent hydrolases. However, the natural substrate(s) is as yet unidentified and to date no structural information is known. We have identified homologous proteins in a number of species and have modelled human PHOSPHO1 based upon the crystal structure of phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP) from Methanococcus jannaschii. The model includes the catalytic Mg(2+) atom bound via three conserved Asp residues (Asp32, Asp34 and Asp203); O-ligands are also provided by a phosphate anion and two water molecules. Additional residues involved in PSP-catalysed hydrolysis are conserved and are located nearby, suggesting both enzymes share a similar reaction mechanism. In PHOSPHO1, none of the PSP residues that confer the enzyme's substrate specificity (Arg56, Glu20, Met43 and Phe49) are conserved. Instead, we propose that two fully conserved Asp residues (Asp43 and Asp123), not present in PSPs contribute to substrate specificity in PHOSPHO1. Our findings show that PHOSPHO1 is not a member of the subfamily of PSPs but belongs to a novel, closely related enzyme group within the HAD superfamily.
PC cell-derived growth factor, also known as progranulin, is an M(r) 88,000 growth factor (referred as PCDGF/GP88) overexpressed in human breast cancer. Antisense inhibition of PCDGF/GP88 expression in MDA-MB-468 cells inhibited tumor formation in nude mice. In estrogen receptor-positive cells, PCDGF/GP88 was expressed in response to estradiol and shown to mediate its mitogenic effect. Pathologic studies indicated that PCDGF/GP88 was expressed in 80% of invasive ductal carcinomas in correlation with parameters of poor prognosis. In the present article, the relationship between PCDGF/GP88 expression and tamoxifen resistance was examined in MCF-7 cells. PCDGF/GP88 overexpression rendered MCF-7 cells able to proliferate in the absence of estrogen and in the presence of tamoxifen. The PCDGF/GP88-overexpressing cells formed tumors in ovariectomized nude mice in the absence of estradiol and in its presence, in contrast to MCF-7 cells. Tumor growth of the overexpressing cells was increased significantly when the mice were treated with tamoxifen. PCDGF/GP88 blocked tamoxifen-induced apoptosis by preventing down-regulation of bcl-2 expression and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. In addition, PCDGF/GP88-overexpressing cells presented higher level of the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1 than MCF-7 control cells. Tamoxifen treatment additionally increased the level of vascular endothelial growth factor. These studies suggest that PCDGF/GP88 plays a critical role in breast cancer tumorigenesis and in the transition to estrogen independence and tamoxifen resistance, a hallmark of poor prognosis. On the basis of the in vivo studies, it is postulated that tamoxifen treatment of patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors overexpressing PCDGF/GP88 could have adverse clinical consequences.
SLC17A5 encodes a lysosomal membrane protein, sialin, which transports sialic acid from lysosomes. Mutations in sialin result in neurodegenerative sialic acid storage disorders, Salla disease (SD) and infantile sialic acid storage disease (ISSD). Here we analyzed sialin in mouse central nervous system (CNS) and primary cortical and hippocampal neurons and glia. In the CNS, sialin was predominantly expressed in neurons, especially in the proliferative zone of the prospective neocortex and the hippocampus in developing brain. In nonneuronal cells and primary glial cell cultures, mouse sialin was localized into lysosomes but interestingly, in primary neuronal cultures sialin was not targeted into lysosomes but rather revealed a punctate staining along the neuronal processes and was also seen in the plasma membrane. These data demonstrate a nonlysosomal localization of sialin in neurons and would imply a role for sialin in the secretory processes of neuronal cells.
CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that functions as an ectoenzyme and as a receptor. Based on the structural similarity between CD38 and ADP-ribosyl cyclase from Aplysia californica, it was hypothesized that CD38 is expressed as a homodimer on the surface of cells. Indeed, CD38 dimers have been reported, however, the structural requirements for their stabilization on the plasma membrane are unknown. We demonstrate that the majority of CD38 is assembled as noncovalently associated homodimers on the surface of B cells. Analysis of CD38 mutants, expressed in Ba/F3 cells, revealed that truncation of the cytoplasmic region or mutation of a single amino acid within the alpha1-helix of CD38 decreased the stability of the CD38 homodimers when solubilized in detergent. Cells expressing the unstable CD38 homodimers had diminished expression of CD38 on the plasma membrane and the half-lives of these CD38 mutant proteins on the plasma membrane were significantly reduced. Together, these results show that CD38 is expressed as noncovalently associated homodimers on the surface of murine B cells and suggest that appropriate assembly of CD38 homodimers may play an important role in stabilizing CD38 on the plasma membrane of B cells.
NQO1 is a cytosolic flavoprotein that plays a dual role in the detoxification of potentially carcinogenic compounds and the bioreductive activation of quinone based anticancer drugs. Two polymorphic variants of NQO1 exist (NQO1*2 and NQO1*3) which cause significant phenotypic reductions in NQO1 protein content and activity. Current methods for detecting NQO1 polymorphisms commonly use PCR-RFLP techniques and have exclusively used DNA isolated from fresh tissues. This study describes a method that is suitable for analysing NQO1 polymorphisms in genomic DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. The method utilises two rounds of PCR amplification using a nested primer strategy that generates specific PCR products followed by RFLP analysis using either Hinf1 (for NQO1*2) or Msp1 (for NQO1*3). Whilst existing methods proved unsatisfactory (low product yield and poor specificity), the nested primer strategy produced good quality PCR products suitable for RFLP analysis and genotyping of NQO1*2 and NQO1*3 in archival tissue samples. The ability to utilise the vast archives of human tissue held by pathology laboratories would be of considerable benefit as retrospective studies comparing NQO1 genotype status, patient history and treatment outcomes could be conducted.
CYP1A1 polymorphisms have been associated with a higher risk to develop lung cancer, particularly in Japanese. The type and the frequency of the polymorphisms can vary according to the ethnicity. In the present study, we aimed to determine the frequency of CYP1A1(*)2B and (*)4, and to look for other possible polymorphisms that may happen in exon 7 in individuals from Rio de Janeiro, an ethnic mixed population from Brazil. We developed a PCR-SSCP method for screening the genomic polymorphic region from 2289 to 2645 bp. Seven different migration patterns were found among 405 individuals, 130 healthy blood donors and 275 outpatients from Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto located in Rio de Janeiro. Five of the migration patterns corresponded to the genotypes: (*)1/(*)1 (the wild type); (*)1/(*)2B; (*)1/(*)4, (*)2B/(*)4 (heterozygous polymorphic) and (*)2B/(*)2B (homozygous polymorphic). Two other patterns corresponded to gene alterations not yet published: a C > T transition localized at the position 2461, and a C > T transition localized at position 2445. The genotype frequencies of the studied polymorphisms were: for CYP1A1(*)2B - 83.7% to (*)1/(*)1, 15.1% to (*)1/(*)2B and 1.2% to (*)2B/(*)2B; for CYP1A1(*)4 - 93.1% to (*)1/(*)1, 6.9% to (*)1/(*)4. The distribution of CYP1A1(*)2B and (*)4 genotypes combined were similar between white and non-white individuals. However, when the non-white individuals were stratified between blacks and mulattos, and then compared with white, black individuals showed a higher frequency of the wild type genotype (P = 0.008) and a lower frequency of genotype (*)1/(*)4 (P = 0.026). Additionally, when black and mulatto individuals were compared, blacks had a higher frequency of the wild type genotype (P = 0.008) and a lower frequency of the(*)1/(*)2B genotype (P = 0.0008), showing a different ethnic distribution of CYP1A1 polymorphisms.
ABO incompatibility and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) sensitization remain the two largest barriers to optimal utilization of kidneys from live donors. Here we describe the first successful transplantation of patients who were both ABO incompatible and crossmatch positive with their only available donor. A preconditioning regimen of plasmapheresis (PP) and low-dose CMV hyperimmune globulin (CMVIg) was delivered every other day until donor-specific antibody (DSA) titers were reduced to a safe level and isoagglutinin titers were < or =16. Each patient received quadruple sequential immunosuppression, splenectomy and three protocol post-transplant PP/CMVIg treatments. There was no hyperacute rejection. Two of the three patients had a persistent positive cytotoxic crossmatch on the day of transplant and eliminated their DSA subsequently. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in one patient was reversed by reinitiating PP/CMVIg and anti-CD20. The patients are more than 9 months post-transplant with excellent graft function. Preconditioning with PP/CMVIg results in a durable suppression of DSA and permits accommodation of the allograft to a discordant blood type. The ability to cross these two barriers simultaneously is clinically important as sensitized patients have often exhausted their blood type compatible living donors during previous transplants.
CYP11A1 encodes the P450scc enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of steroid biosynthesis. It is expressed in the adrenals and gonads under the control of pituitary peptide hormones. Transcription factor SF-1, which binds to the CYP11A1 promoter, plays an important role in the tissue-specific and hormonally regulated expression. Transgenic mouse experiments linking the CYP11A1 promoter to a reporter gene demonstrate the importance of the SF-1-binding site in directing balanced CYP11A1 gene expression. In addition, targeted mutagenesis of Cyp11a1 also reveals the importance of this gene in steroid secretion, gene regulation, and development of genitalia. Zebrafish cyp11a1 is expressed in the gonads and interrenal glands in the adults, similar to mammals. In addition, it is expressed in yolk syncytial layer during early embryogenesis. These two animal models complement each other for the understanding of gene regulatory pathways in human diseases related to steroid imbalance.
CYP11B1 and the closely related CYP11B2 are involved in the production of adrenal steroid hormones. Although in human their primary structure is 93% identical they are involved in the biosynthesis of functionally diverse products, such as glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, respectively. In contrast, bovine CYP11B1 combines both activities in one single enzyme. The CYP11B family belongs to class I cytochromes P450 that have been described in bacteria and mitochondria and receive their electrons from a low molecular weight iron sulphur protein which is reduced by a NADPH-dependent FAD-containing reductase. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge on the modulation of aldosterone and cortisol synthesis by transcriptional regulation, on the molecular level as consequence of mutations found in patients suffering from steroid hormone-related diseases as well as introduced by site-directed mutagenesis and as consequence of protein-protein interaction with both CYP11A1 and the natural redox partner adrenodoxin.
CYP2C9 is distinguished by a preference for substrates bearing a negative charge at physiological pH. Previous studies have suggested that CYP2C9 residues R97 and K72 may play roles in determining preference for anionic substrates by interaction at the active site or in the access channel. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of these two residues in determining substrate selectivity. R97 and K72 were substituted with negative, uncharged polar and hydrophobic residues using a degenerate polymerase chain reaction-directed strategy. Wild-type and mutant enzymes were expressed in bicistronic format with human cytochrome P450 reductase in Escherichia coli. Mutation of R97 led to a loss of holoenzyme expression for R97A, R97V, R97L, R97T, and R97E mutants. Low levels of hemoprotein were detected for R97Q, R97K, R97I, and R97P mutants. Significant apoenzyme was observed, suggesting that heme insertion or protein stability was compromised in R97 mutants. These observations are consistent with a structural role for R97 in addition to any role in substrate binding. By contrast, all K72 mutants examined (K72E, K72Q, K72V, and K72L) could be expressed as hemoprotein at levels comparable to wild-type. Type I binding spectra were obtained with wild-type and K72 mutants using diclofenac and ibuprofen. Mutation of K72 had little or no effect on the interaction with these substrates, arguing against a critical role in determining substrate specificity. Thus, neither residue appears to play a role in determining substrate specificity, but a structural role for R97 can be proposed consistent with recently published crystallographic data for CYP2C9 and CYP2C5.
CYP1B1 activates various environmental carcinogens in human tissues, including renal tissues. We hypothesize that certain polymorphisms of the CYP1B1 gene are risk factors for renal cell cancer. The rationale for this hypothesis is that chemical procarcinogenic compounds require metabolic activation by oxidative enzymes such as CYP1B1 to be transformed into potentially carcinogenic forms. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the genotypic distributions of six different loci on the CYP1B1 gene and their association with renal cell cancer.
CYP2C9 metabolizes a wide range of drugs, many of which are negatively charged at physiological pH. Therefore, it has been thought that complementarily charged amino acid(s) are critically involved in substrate binding. Previous studies have implicated arginine residues at positions 97, 105, and 108 and aspartate at position 293 in the normal catalytic function of the enzyme. To elucidate the role of these amino acids in the substrate specificity of CYP2C9, a series of mutants were constructed and analyzed for functional activity, thermal stability, and ligand binding. Charge-modifying mutations at positions 97, 105, and 293 decreased catalytic activity toward diclofenac, (S)-warfarin, and pyrene in a substrate-independent manner with Arg105 the least, and Arg97 the most, sensitive amino acids in this regard. Decreases in functional activity paralleled thermal instability of the mutants, suggesting that loss of function reflects more generalized structural changes rather than the absence of a specifically charged amino acid at these three positions. The R108H mutant was inactive toward all three substrates because of unexpected nitrogen ligation to the heme. Conversely, the R108F mutant exhibited substrate-dependent catalytic behavior, with almost complete loss of activity toward (S)-warfarin and diclofenac, but preservation of pyrene metabolism. In addition, the R108F mutation abrogated the Type I difference spectra induced by flurbiprofen and benzbromarone, obligate anions at physiological pH. These data identify critical roles for Arg97 and Asp293 in the structural stability of the enzyme and demonstrate a selective role for Arg108 in the binding and metabolism of negatively charged substrates of CYP2C9.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family that is structurally adapted to facilitate the metabolism of 3-phosphoinositide lipid second messengers, especially PtdIns(3,4,5) P (3). Cellular PTEN activity is restrained by the retention of C-terminally phosphorylated enzyme in the cytosol. Dephosphorylation by as yet undefined phosphatases initiates an electrostatic switch which targets PTEN specifically to the plasma membrane, where it binds through multiple positively charged residues in both the C2 and N-terminal domains and is susceptible to feedback regulation through proteolytic degradation. PTEN also forms signalling complexes with PDZ domain-containing adaptors, such as the MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) proteins, interactions which appear to be necessary for metabolism of localized pools of PtdIns(3,4,5) P (3) involved in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics. TPIP [TPTE (transmembrane phosphatase with tensin homology) and PTEN homologous inositol lipid phosphatase] is a novel gene product which exists in multiply spliced forms. TPIPalpha has PtdIns(3,4,5) P (3) 3-phosphatase activity and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, via two transmembrane spanning regions, where it may metabolize PtdIns(3,4,5) P (3) that appears to be unaffected by expressed PTEN. PTEN can be acutely regulated by oxidative stress and by endogenously produced reactive oxygen species. This mechanism provides a novel means to stimulate phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent signalling pathways, which may be important in circumstances where PtdIns(3,4,5) P (3) and oxidants are produced concurrently.
CD36 is a trans-membrane receptor that regulates apoptosis and angiogenesis in response to its ligand thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). This study measures expression of CD36 and TSP-1 in breast cancer cell lines. Expression of TSP-1 was approximately 50-fold higher in the aggressive cell line MDA-MB-231 than in less aggressive MCF-7, BT-474, ZR-75 and T47-D cells. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 express 30 to 100-fold less CD36 than less aggressive cells. Hormone-dependent T47-D and MCF-7 cells down-regulate CD36 in response to estradiol, and anti-hormone ICI 182,780 block this effect. These results suggest that the estrogen receptors play a role in regulating CD36 expression and ICI 182,780 prevents loss of CD36 as a novel mechanism for its anti-estrogen effect in breast cancer cells.
CYP2E1 and CYP4A11 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that are regulated by physiological conditions including diabetes and fasting. In addition, the xenochemical clofibrate has been reported to induce both rodent CYP2E1 and CYP4A. These findings suggest similar modes of regulation. Also in common to both enzymes is the ability to metabolize fatty acids such as laurate and arachidonic acid. Here, we used primary cultures of human hepatocytes to determine if certain xenochemicals could regulate CYP2E1 and CYP4A11. Ethanol significantly (p < 0.05) increased expression of CYP2E1 mRNA by 216 +/- 32% of control, but did not alter CYP4A11 mRNA accumulation (145 +/- 22% of control). In contrast, hepatocytes exposed to ethanol exhibited only a slight elevation in CYP2E1 protein (122 +/- 13% of control) and a negligible effect on CYP4A11 protein. Clofibrate significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced both CYP4A11 mRNA and protein by 239 +/- 30% and 154 +/- 10% of control, respectively, but did not increase CYP2E1. Because rodent CYP4A is reportedly regulated by fatty acids through peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and CYP2E1 is induced by high fat diets, we examined the effects of a medium chain fatty acid, palmitate on CYP2E1 mRNA content. Palmitic acid significantly (p < 0.05) increased CYP2E1 mRNA to 326 +/- 57% of control. Collectively, results presented here identify agents that enhance CYP2E1 and CYP4A11 at the transcription level and suggest that fatty acids may represent a similar mode of regulation for these P450 enzymes. The lack of induction of CYP2E1 protein by ethanol in human hepatocytes indicates that for certain P450 enzymes, isolated hepatocytes may not be an adequate tool for predicting in vivo responses.
PC SPES is an eight-component herbal product marketed for the treatment of prostate cancer. The manufacturer of PC SPES claims that the herbal combination is a synergistic blend, but the purported synergy has never been tested. We examined the interaction in cell culture of these eight individual herbal components by the use of an isobologram.
WWOX (WW domain containing oxidoreductase) is a tumor suppressor gene that maps to the common fragile site FRA16D. We showed previously that WWOX is frequently altered in human lung and esophageal cancers. The purpose of this study was to delineate more precisely the role of WWOX in pancreatic carcinogenesis.
ELOVL4 is a member of the fatty acid elongase (ELO) family of genes. Mutations of this gene are responsible for autosomal dominant Stargardt-like macular degeneration. However, the specific role of ELOVL4 in photoreceptor cells and the mechanism by which mutations in ELOVL4 causes macular degeneration are not known. In this study we examined the subcellular localization of wild type (wt) and mutant (mt) ELOVL4 EGFP fusion protein and the potential functional consequence of mtELOVL4 expression on cell viability.
PTEN deficiency activates Akt signaling and results in a variety of human malignancies. Encouragingly, recent studies demonstrate that small molecules can regulate FOXO1a, an Akt target, to suppress tumor growth, and FOXO1a is therefore a promising anticancer drug target.
CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 mRNA expression levels were markedly up-regulated by dexamethasone (DEX), but not by rifampicin (RIF). CYP3A5 mRNA level was not increased significantly by DEX, RIF, or phenobarbital. Testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activity was induced to about 2-fold of control by DEX. However, concomitant treatment with RIF did not alter DEX-mediated induction of CYP3A mRNA expression and testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activity. DEX-mediated induction of CYP3A mRNA was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist. At 5microM RU486, DEX-mediated induction of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 mRNA expression was inhibited almost completely. These results suggest that, in human fetal hepatocytes, PXR is not involved in DEX-mediated induction of CYP3A4 and CYP3A7, and that the induction is mediated directly by GR.
CYP2C9 catalyses the biotransformation of the oral anticoagulants S-warfarin and R- and S-acenocoumarol. According to data obtained in vitro, phenprocoumon is also metabolized by CYP2C9 but the impact of the CYP2C9 polymorphism on phenprocoumon pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Twenty-six healthy heterozygous and homozygous carriers of the CYP2C9 alleles *1 (wild-type), *2 (Arg144Cys), and *3 (Ile359Leu) received a single oral dose of 12 mg of racemic phenprocoumon. Plasma and 12 h urine concentrations of both enantiomers and their monohydroxylated metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection. No significant effect of the CYP2C9 variants *2 and *3 on R-phenprocoumon pharmacokinetic parameters was detected, but S-phenprocoumon clearance tended to decrease with increasing number of CYP2C9*2 and *3 alleles. The ratios of S- to R-phenprocoumon plasma clearances were higher with a median of 0.95 in carriers of *1/*1 versus 0.65 in *3/*3 (P < 0.001 for trend). Plasma and urine concentrations of 4'-, 6- and 7-hydroxyphenprocoumon were significantly lower in homozygous carriers of the CYP2C9*2 and *3 variants compared to CYP2C9*1/*1. Carriers of CYP2C9*3/*3 had a median AUC of (R,S) 7-OH-phenprocoumon of only approximately 25% compared to the wild-type genotype. The AUC of (R,S) 6-OH-phenprocoumon was only approximately 50% in CYP2C9*3/*3 compared to the homozygous wild-type genotype. In conclusion, carriers of CYP2C9*2 and *3 alleles had a lower metabolic capacity regarding phenprocoumon hydroxylation than those with CYP2C9*1/*1. However, regarding phenprocoumon hydroxylation CYP2C9 genotypes had only marginal effects on S- and R-phenprocoumon total clearance in healthy volunteers.
ABCG2 [also known as BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein) or MXR] is an ABC (ATP-binding cassette) protein shown to confer multidrug resistance. ABCG2 was initially identified in resistant breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7/AdrVp1000) selected with doxorubicin and verapamil. Later studies demonstrated the presence of a point mutation (Arg482 to Thr) in ABCG2 in MCF-7/AdrVp1000 cells. This mutation was shown to modulate the transport of Rh123 (rhodamine 123). In the present study, we have used a previously characterized photoreactive drug analogue of Rh123, IAARh123 (iodoaryl-azido-Rh123), to examine the effects of the Arg482Thr mutation on Rh123 binding and transport by ABCG2. Our results show that both wild-type (ABCG2R482) and mutant (ABCG2T482) ABCG2 bound directly to IAARh123. Surprisingly, however, wild-type ABCG2R482, which does not transport Rh123, was more intensely photolabelled than mutant ABCG2T482. In addition, inhibition of IAARh123 photolabelling using various drug substrates of ABCG2 revealed some differences between wild-type and mutant ABCG2. For example, a molar excess of mitoxantrone was more effective at inhibiting IAARh123 labelling of wild-type than of mutant ABCG2, while excess cisplatin, taxol and methotrexate showed significant inhibition of IAARh123 binding to both wild-type and mutant ABCG2. Taken together, the results of this study provide the first demonstration of the direct binding of drugs to ABCG2.
RRM1 has important functions in the determination of the malignant phenotype. It controls cell proliferation through deoxynucleotide production and metastatic propensity through PTEN induction. It is located in a region of loss of heterozygosity in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is a predictor of poor survival. We hypothesized that RRM1 expression would be a significant predictor of outcome in NSCLC.
ACE2 is a novel homologue of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). ACE2 is highly expressed in human heart and animal data suggest that ACE2 is an essential regulator of cardiac function in vivo. Since overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system contributes to the progression of heart failure, this investigation assessed changes in gene expression of ACE2, ACE, AT1 receptor and renin in the human failing heart.
ACE gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism is a well-known risk factor of hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and progression of diabetic nephropathy. In carriers of allele D, serum level of angiotensin-II is higher, which can be associated with increased oxidative stress and subsequent endothelial damage. Albuminuria is a sensitive marker of endothelial damage, while serum activity of the enzyme gamma-glutamyl transferase--that plays important role in the antioxidant defense--may refer to the level of oxidative stress. The present paper reports on a cross-sectional clinical study, where authors have examined on the relation between ACE gene insertion/deletion polymorphism and carbohydrate metabolism, hypertension as well as albuminuria in type 2 diabetics (n = 145). In patients carrying allele D, fructosamine levels were significantly higher (p = 0.007) than in carriers of allele I. Patients with II + ID genotypes and those who were treated with insulin took more antihypertensive drugs than the ones with II genotype or orally treated (p = 0.015). They found a significant association between genotype and fructosamine level (p = 0.023). Association between genotype or modality of treatment of diabetes (oral vs, insulin) and combined treatment of hypertension (number of antihypertensive drugs) was of borderline significance. They found that fructosamin level of patients receiving ACE inhibitor was lower than that of patients not receiving ACE inhibitors. In patients with allele D, they have also found higher activity of gamma-GT and higher albuminuria. From this results and data of the literature the authors conclude that because of insulin resistance (in connection with the presence of allele D), these patients tend to have a worse metabolic state, more advanced glycation products, due to which oxidative stress and endothelial cell damage may develop. As albuminuria and activity of gamma-GT were both found higher in patients with allele D, and our patients did not suffer of any hepatic disease, authors take the consequence that gamma-GT is a marker of the oxidative stress caused by allele D. Endothelial damage may explain that these patients take a higher number of antihypertensive combination. Based on this, D allele may contribute--via increased glycation and oxidative stress--to the target organ damage in type 2 diabetes.
"ACE inhibitor therapy is widely used in lower-risk patients with type 2 diabetes to reduce mortality, despite limited evidence to support this clinical strategy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between ACE inhibitor use and mortality in patients with diabetes and no cardiovascular disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND SETTINGS: Using the Saskatchewan health databases, 12,272 new users of oral hypoglycemic agents were identified between the years of 1991 and 1996. We excluded 3,202 subjects with previous cardiovascular disease. Of the remaining subjects, 1,187 ""new users"" of ACE inhibitors were identified (ACE inhibitor cohort). Subjects not receiving ACE inhibitor therapy throughout the follow-up period served as the control cohort (n = 4,989). Subjects were prospectively followed until death or the end of 1999. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess differences in all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality between cohort groups."
CA1 pyramidal cells receive two major excitatory inputs: the perforant path (PP) terminates in the most distal dendrites, whereas the Schaffer collaterals (SC) terminate more proximally. We have examined the mechanism of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that follows single subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in these inputs. The AHPs were not reduced by a GABAA antagonist or by agents that block Ca2+ entry. Application of the Ih blocker, ZD7288, partially blocked the AHP in the PP; the substantial remaining component was blocked by 2-hydroxysaclofen, a GABAB antagonist. In contrast, the AHP in the SC depends nearly completely on Ih, with almost no GABAB component. Thus postsynaptic GABAB receptors appear to be preferentially involved at distal synapses, consistent with the spatial distribution of GABAB receptors and g protein-coupled inward rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. GABAB does, however, play a role at proximal synapses through presynaptic suppression of glutamate release, a mechanism that is much weaker at distal synapses. Experiments were conducted to explore the functional role of the AHP in the PP, which has a higher N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)/AMPA ratio than the SC. Blockade of the AHP converted a response that had a small NMDA component to one that had a large component. These results indicate that the Ih and postsynaptic GABAB conductances act as a brake on distally generated NMDA responses.
CYP2A13 is a human cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that is efficient in the metabolic activation of tobacco-specific nitrosamines. Sequence variations that affect CYP2A13 expression may contribute to interindividual differences in susceptibility to tobacco-related tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to identify any impact of CYP2A13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on CYP2A13 expression in human lung. Expression levels of CYP2A13 mRNA in normal lung displayed significant interindividual variation (>50-fold). Preliminary sequence analysis of CYP2A13 RNA-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products suggested that a 7520C > G variation, located in the 3'-untranslated region, could be associated with low transcript abundance. Subsequently, we developed a method for the measurement of relative allelic expression, by taking advantage of the capability for melting-curve analysis in real-time PCR. Quantitative analyses using this method indicated that transcripts from the 7520G-containing alleles were >10-fold less abundant than those from the 7520C-containing alleles in 14 of 16 samples examined. The frequencies of the 7520C > G variation in anonymous White, African American, Hispanic, and Asian newborns from New York State were found to be 5.2, 26.8, 17.7, and 4.3%, respectively. The 7520C > G SNP was previously known to be present in both CYP2A13(*)1H and (*)3 alleles. However, analyses of SNP distribution indicated that, in 15 of the 16 heterozygous DNA samples, the 7520C > G SNP belonged to new CYP2A13(*)1 haplotypes. These findings provide a basis for further studies that associate CYP2A13 haplotypes with incidences of smoking-related lung tumors and for studies on the mechanisms of the low-expression phenotype of the 7520G-containing allele.
CA1 pyramidal neurons from animals that have acquired a hippocampus-dependent task show a reduced slow postburst afterhyperpolarization (sAHP). To understand the functional significance of this change, we examined and characterized the sAHP activated by different patterns of synaptic stimuli and its impact on postsynaptic signal integration. Whole cell current-clamp recordings were performed on rat CA1 pyramidal neurons, and trains of stratum radiatum stimuli varying in duration, frequency, and intensity were used to activate the AHP. At -68 mV, a short train of subthreshold stimuli (20-150 Hz) generated only the medium AHP. In contrast, just two suprathreshold stimuli >50 Hz triggered a prominent sAHP sensitive to bath-applications of isoproterenol, carbachol, or intracellularly applied BAPTA, suggesting that the underlying current is the Ca2+-activated K+ current, the sIAHP. The sAHP magnitude was positively related to stimulus train duration and frequency, consistent with its dependence on intracellular Ca2+ accumulation for activation. About 20% of neurons recorded did not have a sAHP. In response to high-frequency suprathreshold stimuli, these neurons developed a pronounced afterdepolarization (ADP) and multiple action potential firing. The ADP magnitude increased with successive stimuli and was positively related to stimulus intensity and frequency. It was sensitive to bath-applications of thapsigargin and nitrendipine, and abolished by d-AP5, indicating that it is supported by intracellular Ca2+ release, the L-type Ca2+ influx, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated influx. In the presence of D-AP5, we were unable to trigger an ADP with maximal stimulus intensity. Pharmacologically eliminating the sAHP allowed neurons to develop an ADP with the original stimulus train. We propose that the slow AHP acts to facilitate Mg2+ re-block of the activated NMDA receptors, thereby reducing temporal summation and preventing an NMDA receptor-dependent ADP during intense synaptic events. Neuromodulation of the sAHP may thus affect information throughput and regulate NMDA receptor-mediated plasticity.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in many human cancers, and its expression is reduced or absent in almost half of hepatoma patients. We used the Cre-loxP system to generate a hepatocyte-specific null mutation of Pten in mice (AlbCrePten(flox/flox) mice). AlbCrePten(flox/flox) mice showed massive hepatomegaly and steatohepatitis with triglyceride accumulation, a phenotype similar to human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Adipocyte-specific genes were induced in mutant hepatocytes, implying adipogenic-like transformation of these cells. Genes involved in lipogenesis and beta-oxidation were also induced, possibly as a result of elevated levels of the transactivating factors PPARgamma and SREBP1c. Importantly, the loss of Pten function in the liver led to tumorigenesis, with 47% of AlbCrePten(flox/flox) livers developing liver cell adenomas by 44 weeks of age. By 74-78 weeks of age, 100% of AlbCrePten(flox/flox) livers showed adenomas and 66% had hepatocellular carcinomas. AlbCrePten(flox/flox) mice also showed insulin hypersensitivity. In vitro, AlbCrePten(flox/flox) hepatocytes were hyperproliferative and showed increased hyperoxidation with abnormal activation of protein kinase B and MAPK. Pten is thus an important regulator of lipogenesis, glucose metabolism, hepatocyte homeostasis, and tumorigenesis in the liver.
"SOD2 is an antioxidant protein that protects cells against mitochondrial superoxide. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lacking SOD2 are capable of rescuing lethally irradiated hosts, but reconstituted animals display a persistent hemolytic anemia characterized by increased oxidative damage to red cells, with morphologic similarity to human ""sideroblastic"" anemia. We report further characterization of this novel SOD2-deficiency anemia. Electron micrographs of SOD2-deficient reticulocytes reveal striking mitochondrial proliferation and mitochondrial membrane thickening. Peripheral blood smears show abundant iron-stainable granules in mature red cells (siderocytes). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of cells labeled with oxidation-sensitive dyes demonstrates enhanced production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide by SOD2-deficient cells. Oxidative damage to proteins is increased in SOD2-deficient cells, with much of the damage affecting membrane/insoluble proteins. Red cell proteome analysis demonstrates that several proteins involved in folding/chaperone function, redox regulation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, and red cell metabolism show altered expression in SOD2-deficient cells. This data, combined with information on how protein expression levels change upon antioxidant therapy, will aid in identification of proteins that are sensitive to oxidative damage in this model, and by extension, may have a role in the regulation of red cell lifespan in other hemolytic disorders."
ACE and chymase play crucial roles in the establishment of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. In the present study, time sequences of ACE and chymase-like activities, and their correlation with hypertrophic changes including free wall thickness and cardiac fibrosis, were elucidated in dogs with constant pressure overload to the right ventricle. Pulmonary artery banding (PAB) was applied so that the diameter of the main pulmonary artery was reduced to 60% of the original size, right ventricular pressure was elevated by about 70%, and pulmonary artery flow was increased by about three times of that in sham operation groups. These increases remained unchanged 15, 60, and 180 days after PAB, suggesting that constant right ventricular pressure overload was obtained, at least during this period. The diameter of the right ventricular myocyte was slightly increased and the percentage of fractional shortening was decreased 15 days after PAB. Right ventricular wall thickness and interstitial collagenous fiber were, however, not different from those of sham-operated dogs, suggesting that this period is a period of adaptation to the overload. Sixty days after PAB, the diameter of the right ventricular myocyte was further increased, and right ventricular wall thickness and interstitial collagenous fiber were also increased. These changes were almost identical even 180 days after PAB. Thus, stable hypertrophy was elicited from 60 through 180 days after PAB. ACE activity was facilitated at the adaptation period to the overload (15 days after PAB), but chymase activity was not facilitated at this period. On the other hand, both ACE and chymase-like activities were unchanged in the earlier phase (60 days after PAB) of stable hypertrophy, but facilitated in the latter phase (180 days after PAB). These findings suggest the pathophysiologic roles of these enzymes may be different over the time course of pressure overload-induced hypertrophy.
CYP1A1 induction has been widely studied in vertebrates and is used as an indicator of exposure to persistent pollutants like dioxins, polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), especially in fish. Little work on this enzyme has been carried out in invertebrates, and results have suggested enzymatic or gene differences with the vertebrate isozyme. To date, a CYP4 isozyme has been characterized and sequenced in the marine mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, but no CYP1A invertebrate sequence has been found. The aim of this study was to identify CYP1A and CYP4 transcripts in the freshwater bivalve, Unio tumidus, and to compare their expression with those of the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, after treatment with the specific CYP1A1 and CYP4 vertebrate inducers, Aroclor 1254 and diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP), respectively. In spite of numerous amplification conditions and primer combinations tested, which had been successful in fish, no CYP1A sequence was amplified on cDNA of the digestive gland from either control and Aroclor-treated mussels. On the other hand, CYP4 transcripts were amplified in digestive glands from control and DEHP-treated mussels. As opposed to fish, no induction of this isozyme was obtained in mussels after phthalate treatment.
MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) catalyses the synthesis of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the folate derivative utilized in homocysteine remethylation to methionine. A severe deficiency of MTHFR results in hyperhomocysteinaemia and homocystinuria. Betaine supplementation has proven effective in ameliorating the biochemical abnormalities and the clinical course in patients with this deficiency. Mice with a complete knockout of MTHFR serve as a good animal model for homocystinuria; early postnatal death of these mice is common, as with some neonates with low residual MTHFR activity. We attempted to rescue Mthfr-/- mice from postnatal death by betaine supplementation to their mothers throughout pregnancy and lactation. Betaine decreased the mortality of Mthfr-/- mice from 83% to 26% and significantly improved somatic development from postnatal day 1, compared with Mthfr-/- mice from unsupplemented dams. Biochemical evaluations demonstrated higher availability of betaine in suckling pups, decreased accumulation of homocysteine, and decreased flux through the trans-sulphuration pathway in liver and brain of Mthfr-/- pups from betaine-supplemented dams. We observed disturbances in proliferation and differentiation in the cerebellum and hippocampus in the knockout mice; these changes were ameliorated by betaine supplementation. The dramatic effects of betaine on survival and growth, and the partial reversibility of the biochemical and developmental anomalies in the brains of MTHFR-deficient mice, emphasize an important role for choline and betaine depletion in the pathogenesis of homocystinuria due to MTHFR deficiency.
CYP27B1 (25-hydroxyvitamin D(3)-1alpha-hydroxylase) catalyzes the metabolization of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) the most active natural Vitamin D metabolite. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) plays a role in the regulation of autoimmunity and cell proliferation and prevents the development of autoimmune diabetes mellitus in animal models besides other autoimmune disorders. One hundred and eighty-seven families with one offspring affected with type1diabetes mellitus were genotyped for the polymorphisms in the promoter region (-1260 C/A) and intron 6 (2338 T/C) of the CYP27B1 gene on chromosome 12 q13.1-13.3 and extended transmission disequilibrium tests (ETDT) were performed. The haplotype CT (-1260 A/2338 T) was significantly more often transmitted to affected offspring (96 transmitted (T) versus 63 not transmitted (NT), P = 0.0089). While the AT (-1260 C/2838 T) was significantly less often transmitted (37 T versus 60 NT, P = 0.0195). This study suggests that CYP27B1 haplotypes may confer susceptibility to type 1 diabetes mellitus in Germans.
CA1 pyramidal neurons degenerate after transient global ischemia, whereas neurons in other regions of the hippocampus remain intact. A step in this selective injury is Ca(2+) and/or Zn(2+) entry through Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptor channels; reducing Ca(2+) permeability of AMPA receptors via expression of Ca(2+)-impermeable GluR2(R) channels or activation of CRE transcription in the hippocampus of adult rats in vivo using shutoff-deficient pSFV-based vectors rescues vulnerable CA1 pyramidal neurons from forebrain ischemic injury. Conversely, the induction of Ca(2+) and/or Zn(2+) influx through AMPA receptors by expressing functional Ca(2+)-permeable GluR2(Q) channels causes the postischemic degeneration of hippocampal granule neurons that otherwise are insensitive to ischemic insult. Thus, the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 gates entry of Ca(2+) and/or Zn(2+) that leads to cell death following transient forebrain ischemia.
ABO incompatibility is not considered a contraindication for allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) despite its association with several immunohaematological complications. At present, there is no general agreement concerning the best methods to reduce these problems. To survey current practice related to ABO-incompatible HSCT in Italy, a questionnaire was sent to all GITMO centres. Specific questions were addressed for management in pretransplant, peritransplant and post transplant phases. A comparison was made with the experience reported in the literature. In all, 74% of GITMO centres answered the questionnaire. A high degree of heterogeneity concerning the pretransplant tests, methods to overcome infusion of ABO-incompatible marrow and post transplant transfusion policy and monitoring was evident. For many of these aspects the literature does not contain unanimous guidelines. The considerable degree of heterogeneity that reflects, at least partially, the lack of consensus in the literature demonstrates that ABO incompatibility is still an open issue in the setting of HSCT and that further studies are needed for a more rationale approach and for the production of evidence-based guidelines.
OGT 719 (Oxford GlycoSciences, Abingdon, UK) is a novel nucleoside analogue with a galactose molecule attached to a fluorinated pyrimidine. OGT 719 has the capacity selectively to bind to asialoglycoprotein receptors that are found exclusively on hepatocytes and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The aim of this study was to establish the safety and to examine the pharmacokinetics of this novel compound in patients with liver cancer. Fourteen patients received a total of 37 cycles of OGT 719 at four dose levels ([500 mg/m2 first cycle, 1 000 mg/m2 subsequent cycles], 1000 mg/m2, 3 300 mg/m2 and 7500 mg/m2). OGT 719 was administered as a 3-h intravenous infusion in a 250 ml saline solution, daily for 5 days every 4 weeks. Pharmacokinetic parameters were studied during the first cycle of dose levels 1 and 2 (500 mg/m2. and 1 000 mg/m2, respectively). The maximum plasma concentration was attained within 5 min of completing the infusion and almost doubled, dose dependently, with a doubling of the infused dose. The plasma level declined rapidly in a monophasic manner with an elimination half-life of 2.1 and 2.5 h for dose level 1 and 2, respectively The mean area under the curve (AUC(o - infinity) area under the curve to 24 h; AUC(o - infinity), area under the curve to infinity) doubled at the higher dose level. None of the patients had a significant tumor response. Elimination half-life of OGT 719 by 3-h intravenous infusion is short and monophasic. Toxicity was minimal at the highest dose level.
CAD cells are a murine CNS catecholaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase-positive; TH+) neuronal cell line that undergoes morphological differentiation to resemble CNS catecholaminergic neurons upon serum deprivation. We show here that CAD cells also express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA and protein and produce readily measurable levels of NO. Since both NO and catecholamines (L-DOPA; dopamine; norepinephrine) are redox active molecules, their production within the same cell may affect the cell's vulnerability to insult. Thus, we examined the regulation of NO production by CAD cells and the effect of NO on cell survival. NO is generated in a dose-dependent fashion by treatment with agents (ionomycin; A23817; KCl) known to increase calcium entry across the cell membrane. The NO level can be increased further by pretreatment with sepiapterin, a membrane permeable precursor for BH4 synthesis, suggesting that the BH4 levels or access required for nNOS activation is limited in CAD cells. Reducing mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake using ruthenium red (RuR) increased ionomycin-mediated NO production over ionomycin alone and indicates a critical role for mitochondria in nNOS regulation. Cell death was significantly increased by ionomycin treatment alone or in conjunction with reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. However, NO was not the primary mediator of cell death since NOS inhibitors rescued only less than 10% of the cells. These data suggest that endogenous NO production by nNOS is not a major factor in CAD cell death under these conditions.
CYP1B1 is the enzyme with the highest efficiency of conversion of estradiol to 4-hydroxyestradiol in humans. This metabolite has a well-known carcinogenic effect interacting with genomic DNA and has been hypothesized to be partly responsible for the role played by estrogens in ovarian cancer development. A polymorphism has been described for this enzyme causing a Leu to Val substitution in position 432 (CYP1B1*3). The Val432 allele has a higher efficiency of conversion of estradiol to 4-hydroxyestradiol and has been reported to increase the risk of ovarian cancer. A previous study reported a higher, significant prevalence of CYP1B1*3 polymorphism in ovarian cancer patients of mixed ethnicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CYP1B1*3 polymorphism as a risk factor for ovarian cancer in a Caucasian population. The polymorphism frequency was determined in 223 cases of ovarian cancer and compared with that of 280 healthy female blood donors. Genetic analysis was performed on genomic DNA from PBMC and RFLP methods were used for mutation detection. No significant difference between cases and controls was found. These results do not support a favoring role of CYP1B1*3 in ovarian cancer development in our population.
ABCG2 (BCRP/MXR/ABCP) is a half-transporter associated with multidrug resistance that presumably homodimerizes for function. It has a conserved GXXXG motif in its first transmembrane segment, a motif that has been linked with dimerization in other proteins, e.g., glycophorin A. We substituted either or both glycines of this GXXXG motif with leucines to evaluate the impact on drug transport, ATP hydrolysis, cross-linking, and susceptibility to degradation. All mutants also carried the R482G gain-of-function mutation, and all migrated to the cell surface. The mutations resulted in lost transport for rhodamine 123 and impaired mitoxantrone, pheophorbide a, and BODIPY-prazosin transport, particularly in the double leucine mutant (G406L/G410L). Basal ATPase activity of the G406L/G410L mutant was comparable to the empty vector transfected cells with no substrate induction. Despite impaired function, the mutants retained susceptibility to cross-linking using either disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) or the reducible dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) and demonstrated a high molecular weight complex under nonreducing conditions. Mutations to alanine at the same positions yielded fully functional transporters. Finally, we exposed cells to mitoxantrone to promote folding and processing of the mutant proteins, which in the leucine mutants resulted in increased amounts detected on immunoblot and by immunofluorescence. These studies support a hypothesis that the GXXXG motif promotes proper packing of the transmembrane segments in the functional ABCG2 homodimer, although it does not solely arbitrate dimerization.
ABCA1 is an ATP-binding cassette protein that transports cellular cholesterol and phospholipids onto high density lipoproteins (HDL) in plasma. Lack of ABCA1 in humans and mice causes abnormal lipidation and increased catabolism of HDL, resulting in very low plasma apoA-I, apoA-II, and HDL. Herein, we have used Abca1-/- mice to ask whether ABCA1 is involved in lipidation of HDL in the central nervous system (CNS). ApoE is the most abundant CNS apolipoprotein and is present in HDL-like lipoproteins in CSF. We found that Abca1-/- mice have greatly decreased apoE levels in both the cortex (80% reduction) and the CSF (98% reduction). CSF from Abca1-/- mice had significantly reduced cholesterol as well as small apoE-containing lipoproteins, suggesting abnormal lipidation of apoE. Astrocytes, the primary producer of CNS apoE, were cultured from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice, and nascent lipoprotein particles were collected. Abca1-/- astrocytes secreted lipoprotein particles that had markedly decreased cholesterol and apoE and had smaller apoE-containing particles than particles from Abca1+/+ astrocytes. These findings demonstrate that ABCA1 plays a critical role in CNS apoE metabolism. Since apoE isoforms and levels strongly influence Alzheimer's disease pathology and risk, these data suggest that ABCA1 may be a novel therapeutic target.
ABCA1 is a cholesterol transporter that is widely expressed throughout the body. Outside the central nervous system (CNS), ABCA1 functions in the biogenesis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), where it mediates the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoprotein (apo) A-I. Deficiency of ABCA1 results in lack of circulating HDL and greatly reduced levels of apoA-I. ABCA1 is also expressed in cells within the CNS, but its roles in brain lipid metabolism are not yet fully understood. In the brain, glia synthesize the apolipoproteins involved in CNS lipid metabolism. Here we demonstrate that glial ABCA1 is required for cholesterol efflux to apoA-I and plays a key role in facilitating cholesterol efflux to apoE, which is the major apolipoprotein in the brain. In both astrocytes and microglia, ABCA1 deficiency reduces lipid efflux to exogenous apoE. The impaired ability to efflux lipids in ABCA1-/- glia results in lipid accumulation in both astrocytes and microglia under normal culture conditions. Additionally, apoE secretion is compromised in ABCA1-/- astrocytes and microglia. In vivo, deficiency of ABCA1 results in a 65% decrease in apoE levels in whole brain, and a 75-80% decrease in apoE levels in hippocampus and striatum. Additionally, the effect of ABCA1 on apoE is selective, as apoJ levels are unchanged in brains of ABCA1-/- mice. Taken together, these results show that glial ABCA1 is a key influence on apoE metabolism in the CNS.
ACE2 purified from failing human heart was found to form a complex with integrin beta1 by immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, activity assay, and ESI tandem mass spectroscopy. The ACE2/integrin complex showed a Km of 6.8 microM and a Vmax of 2.13 pmol/min/microl purified enzyme. Activity was optimal at pH 7.5 with Ang II substrate.
CD36 is a class B scavenger receptor recognizing a variety of ligands including long-chain fatty acids and modified LDL. We investigated whether genetic variability at this locus is a determinant of free fatty acid (FFA) plasma levels and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in Caucasians. Typing of 21 polymorphic markers, evenly spanning the CD36 gene, revealed two linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks that could be tagged by five polymorphisms (-33137A>G, -31118G>A, 25444G>A, 27645del>ins and 30294G>C). In 585 non-diabetic individuals of Caucasian origin, the 30294G>C polymorphism was significantly associated with FFA levels (P = 0.02)--an effect that was especially visible among men (P = 0.009). A similar association was observed in this gender at -33137 (P = 0.008) and -31118 (P = 0.028). When the five tag polymorphisms were considered together, men carrying the AGGIG haplotype had 31% higher FFA (P = 0.0002) and 20% higher triglycerides (P = 0.025) than non-carriers. The same haplotype was associated with increased risk of CAD in 197 type 2 diabetic individuals from the US (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.2). A similar tendency was observed in a group of 321 type 2 diabetic individuals from Italy (OR = 1.4, 0.9-2.3), resulting in an overall relative risk of 1.6 (1.1-2.3, P = 0.015) in the two populations considered together. By targeted resequencing, we identified a common variant in the CD36 promoter that is in strong LD with the AGGIG haplotype and could be partly responsible for these findings. In conclusion, this comprehensive study of CD36 variability indicates that the common polymorphisms at this locus modulate lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk in Caucasians.
ACE inhibitors initially developed as vasodilators are effective by their anti-hormonal action. Antagonists of the receptors of angiotensin II (ARA II) should provide an equivalent or better blockade of the rennin-angiotensin system (absence of tolerance). Clinical trials have shown equivalent haemodynamic effects of the two classes, equal functional tolerance but mortality studies have shown more variable results. None have shown the superiority of ARA II over ACE inhibitors and the demonstration of their equivalence has just been reported with high doses in the post-infarction period. A deleterious effect of ARA II in association with betablockers was reported in two mortality studies but has not been confirmed in the most recent trials. The difficulty is to determine the roles of the association of ARA II-ACE inhibitors, ARA II-antialdosterones or of the association of all three classes of molecules.
SLC26A7 is a recently identified Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger that co-localizes with AE1 on the basolateral membrane of Alpha intercalated cells (A-IC) in outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD). The purpose of these studies was to determine whether AE1 and SLC26A7 are differentially regulated in OMCD in pathophysiologic states. Toward this end, the expression and regulation of AE1 and SLC26A7 was examined in water deprivation, a condition known to increase the osmolality of the medulla. Rats were subjected to 3 d of water deprivation while having free access to food. Northern hybridizations demonstrated that in the outer medulla, the mRNA expression of SLC26A7 increased by approximately 300% (P < 0.01 versus control; n = 3), whereas the expression of AE1 decreased by approximately 50% (P < 0.05 versus control, n = 3) in water-deprived rats. Immunoblot analysis studies demonstrated that in the outer medulla, SLC26A7 abundance increased by approximately 3.5-fold (P < 0.02 versus control; n = 3), whereas the AE1 abundance decreased by approximately 55% (P < 0.05 versus control) in water deprivation. The expression of SLC26A7 remained unchanged in the kidney cortex and stomach in water deprivation, indicating the specificity of SLC26A7 upregulation in outer medulla. In situ hybridization indicated the exclusive expression of SLC26A7 in the outer medulla and double immunofluorescence labeling confirmed the co-localization of AE1 and SLC26A7 on the basolateral membrane of A-IC cells in OMCD. It is concluded that AE1 and SLC26A7 are differentially regulated in OMCD in water deprivation. On the basis of these results and previous functional studies indicating the activation of SLC26A7 activity by high osmolality, it is proposed that SLC26A7 may play an important role in bicarbonate reabsorption and or cell volume regulation in OMCD (specifically under hypertonic conditions).
CYP2C9 is a clinically important enzyme, responsible for the metabolism of numerous clinically important therapeutic drugs. In the present study, we discovered 38 single nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP2C9 by resequencing of genomic DNA from 92 individuals from three different racial groups. Haplotype analysis predicted that there are at least 21 alleles of CYP2C9 in this group of individuals. Six new alleles were identified that contained coding changes: L19I (CYP2C9*7), R150H (CYP2C9*8), H251R (CYP2C9*9), E272G (CYP2C9*10), R335W(CYP2C9*11) and P489S (CYP2C9*12). When expressed in a bacterial cDNA expression system, several alleles exhibited altered catalytic activity. CYP2C9*11 appeared to be a putative poor metabolizer allele, exhibiting a three-fold increase in the Km and more than a two-fold decrease in the intrinsic clearance for tolbutamide. Examination of the crystal structure of human CYP2C9 reveals that R335 is located in the turn between the J and J' helices and forms a hydrogen-bonding ion pair with D341 from the J' helix. Abolishing this interaction in CYP2C9*11 individuals could destabilize the secondary structure and alter the substrate affinity. This new putative poor metabolizer (PM) allele was found in Africans. A second potentially PM allele CYP2C9*12 found in a racially unidentified sample also exhibited a modest decrease in the Vmax and the intrinsic clearance for tolbutamide in a recombinant system. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the effect of these new polymorphisms on the metabolism of CYP2C9 substrates.
CYP1B1 and COMT code for the key enzymes of catecholestrogen biosynthesis and metabolism, and their polymorphisms determine a variation of enzymic activities. RFLP analysis was used to study the allele and genotype frequency distributions of CYP1B1 polymorphisms Arg48Gly, Ala119Ser, and Val432Leu and COMT polymorphism Val158Met in 210 breast cancer patients, 138 endometrial cancer patients, and 152 healthy women. The COMT polymorphism showed no significant association with breast or endometrial cancer. For the first time, such association was observed for the CYP1B1 polymorphisms. CYP1B1 allele C (Arg48), which codes for the enzyme more active in estradiol 4-hydroxylation, was associated with higher risk of breast (OR = 3.22, CI 2.34-4.43, p = 0.000) and endometrial (OR = 2.43, CI 1.72-3.44, p = 0.000) cancer. Similar data were obtained for CYP1B1 allele G (Ala119): OR = 2.18, CI 1.58-3.01, p = 0.000 in breast cancer and OR = 2.52, CI 1.78-3.56, p = 0.000 in endometrial cancer. Risk of endometrial, but not breast, cancer was significantly higher in carriers of CYP1B1 genotype Val432/Val. This was explained by stronger estrogen dependence and, consequently, higher estrogen reactivity of the endometrium as compared with the mammary gland.
ACE I/D and AT1R 1166A/C polymorphisms are considered to comprise individual risk factors for the development of coronary disease. We sought to demonstrate that the ACE I/D and AT1R 1166A/C polymorphisms affect coronary artery stenosis in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD). We examined 147 healthy controls and 281 Japanese children with KD. The patients were further divided into group N (n = 246, no ischemia) and group I (n = 35, severe coronary artery stenosis with myocardial ischemia), and we studied the genotype of ACE I/D and AT1R 1166A/C polymorphisms. We also examined ACE activity in patients with acute KD. We did not detect any prevalent genotypes of the ACE and AT1R polymorphisms between controls and KD patients. However, the prevalence of the D allele in the ACE polymorphism and of the C allele in the AT1R polymorphism tended to be higher in group I than in group N (odds ratios, 2.00 and 2.32, respectively). In addition, the presence of the D and/or C alleles significantly increased the relative risk of developing myocardial ischemia (odds ratio, 2.71; p = 0.038). During the convalescent phase of KD, ACE activity was increased despite significant attenuation during the acute phase. These results suggested that the renin-angiotensin system is associated with the formation of severe coronary artery stenosis and myocardial ischemia.
CYP27B1 hydroxylase catalyzes the conversion of 25 hydroxyvitamin D(3) (25OHD(3)) to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), the most active natural vitamin D metabolite, which plays a role in the regulation of immunity and cell proliferation. We therefore investigated two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CYP27B1 hydroxylase gene for an association with Addison's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus.
CYP2C9 is a genetically polymorphic human cytochrome P450 isozyme involved in the oxidative metabolism of many drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory compounds. Individuals genotyped heterozygous or homozygous for CYP2C9 allelic variants have demonstrated altered metabolism of some drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2C9. The ability to expand screening of CYP2C9 allelic variants to a larger set of drugs and pharmaceutical agents would contribute to a better understanding of the significance of CYP2C9 polymorphisms in the population and to predictions of possible outcomes. The authors report the development of an in vitro fluorescence-based assay employing recombinant CYP2C9 variants (CYP2C9*1, CYP2C9*2, and CYP2C9*3) and fluorogenic Vivid(R) CYP2C9 substrates to explore the effects of CYP2C9 polymorphisms on drug metabolism, using drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2C9. Several chemically diverse fluorogenic substrates (Vivid(R) CYP2C9 blue, green, and red substrates) were used as prototypic probes to obtain in vitro CYP2C9 metabolic rates and kinetic parameters, such as apparent K(m), V(max), and V(max)/K(m) ratios for each allelic variant. In addition, a diverse panel of drugs was screened as assay modifiers with CYP2C9*1, CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and the fluorogenic Vivid(R) CYP2C9 substrates. The inhibitory potential of this large group of chemically diverse drugs and compounds has been assessed on the basis of their ability to compete with Vivid(R) CYP2C9 substrates in fluorescent reporter assays, thus providing a sensitive and quick assessment of polymorphism-dependent changes in CYP2C9 metabolism.
PTEN is a novel tumour suppressor gene located on chromosome 10. PTEN mutations are believed to exert their effects through the putative PI3K-AKT-mTOR signalling pathway. Specifically, loss of PTEN leads to activation of AKT, which in turn promotes anti-apoptotic and pro-cell cycle entry pathways believed to be essential in tumourigenesis. Whilst PTEN mutations are frequent in a variety of sporadic cancers and inherited cancer syndromes, it is not clear how frequently PTEN mutations and immunohistochemical loss of PTEN expression occur in sporadic breast cancer. This study used tissue microarrays (TMAs) to assess wild-type PTEN and pAKT immunohistochemical staining in 670 and 691 cases, respectively, of primary operable breast cancer. Scores of 0, 1, and 2 were given for negative, weakly positive, and strongly positive degrees of immunoreactivity, respectively. In addition, immunohistochemical assessment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Her2, and proliferation by MIB1 expression was performed on the same TMAs and the scores were compared with those of PTEN and pAKT. Eight per cent of cases did not express wild-type PTEN. No correlation was observed between patient, tumour and outcome variables and PTEN. pAKT expression correlated inversely with adverse tumour variables such as tumour grade (p< 0.001) and correlated positively with ER status (p< 0.001). No correlation was seen between either PTEN or AKT and EGFR, Her2 or MIB1. No association of PTEN or pAKT was seen in Kaplan-Meier or multivariate analysis for overall survival. The results indicate that loss of PTEN expression is infrequent in breast cancer. PTEN and AKT do not appear to be prognostic markers. The study argues against the current model of a simple linear tumourigenic PTEN-PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in breast cancer. It also suggests that, in this group of breast cancers, the most common upstream regulator of AKT may be ER rather than PTEN, EGFR or Her2.
ABCG5 and ABCG8 transporters play an important role in the absorption and excretion of sterols. Missence polymorphisms (Gln604Glu in the ABCG5 and Asp19His, Tyr54Cys, Thr400Lys, and Ala632Val in the ABCG8) in these genes have been described. In 131 males and 154 females whose dietary composition markedly changed and lipid parameters decreased over an 8-year follow-up study (total cholesterol decreased from 6.21+/-1.31 mmol/l in 1988 to 5.43+/-1.06 mmol/l in 1996), these polymorphisms were investigated using PCR. Plasma lipid levels and changes in plasma lipid levels were independent of the Gln604Glu polymorphism in ABCG5 and Asp19His and the Ala632Val polymorphisms in ABCG8. The Tyr54Cys polymorphism influenced the degree of reduction in total plasma cholesterol (delta -0.49 mmol/l in Tyr54 homozygotes vs. delta +0.12 mmol/l in Cys54 homozygotes, p<0.04) and LDL-cholesterol (delta -0.57 mmol/l in Tyr54 homozygotes vs. delta +0.04 mmol/l in Cys54 homozygotes, p<0.03) levels between 1988 and 1996 in females, but not in males. Male Thr400 homozygotes exhibited a greater decrease in total cholesterol (delta -0.90 mmol/l vs. delta -0.30 mmol/l, p<0.02) and LDL-cholesterol (delta -0.62 mmol/l vs. delta -0.19 mmol/l, p<0.04) than Lys400 carriers. No such association was observed in females. We conclude that Tyr54Cys and Thr400Lys variations in the ABCG8 gene may play a role in the genetic determination of plasma cholesterol levels and could possibly influence the gender-specific response of plasma cholesterol levels after dietary changes. These polymorphisms are of potential interest as genetic variants that may influence the lipid profile.
G6PD deficiency has been reported from India more than 30 years ago and about 13 variants have been characterized biochemically. Here, we report the results of an epidemiological study investigating G6PD deficiency and the mutations among 14 heterogenous populations of India. Of the 3166 males tested, 332 (10.5%) were found to be G6PD-deficient and the prevalence rate varied from 5.7% to 27.9% in the different population groups. Molecular characterization revealed that G6PD Mediterranean (563 C-->T) was the commonest (60.4%) deficient variant followed by G6PD Kerala-Kalyan (949 G-->A; 24.5%) and G6PD Orissa (131 C-->G; 13.3%). G6PD Mediterranean had a more widespread distribution as compared to G6PD Kerala-Kalyan and G6PD Orissa and was associated with both 1311 C and 1311 T polymorhism. G6PD Mediterranean was found to have significantly lower red cell enzyme activity and more severe clinical manifestations than the other two. G6PD Chatham (1003 G-->A) with undetected red cell enzyme activity and G6PD Insuli (989 G-->A) with normal G6PD activity were very rare in the Indian population. The absence of a large number of mutations causing G6PD deficiency points to the fact that the genetic diversity of these populations is considerably lowered than expected.
CYP1A1 isoform is mainly regulated by the transcription factor AhR and to a lesser extent by the nuclear receptor RAR. The effect of a coexposure with 3MC, a AhR ligand, and RA, a RAR ligand, which are, respectively, strong and weak CYP1A1 inducers, is poorly known. We showed in Caco-2 cells that addition of RA significantly decreased 3MC-induced CYP1A1 expression by -55% for mRNA level and -30% for promoter and enzymatic activities. We further showed that RA decreased AhR protein level. Moreover, a physical interaction between AhR and the RAR-corepressor SMRT has been described in vitro. Using the corepressor inhibitor TSA, transfected-cells with SMRT cDNA, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrated that RA addition repressed AhR function through a marked AhR/SMRT physical interaction. This interaction explains the decrease of 3MC-induced CYP1A1 expression. This new mechanism involving the repression of AhR-induced CYP1A1 expression by retinoids allows better knowledge of the CYP1A1 regulation.
GPI 15715 is a new water-soluble prodrug that is hydrolyzed to release propofol. The objectives of this crossover study in volunteers were to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of GPI 15715 in comparison with propofol emulsion.
CS sprays are now being widely used by police in the UK. Concerns are being expressed regarding the toxicity of this substance and some of the situations in which it is being used. This is the first reported case in the UK of CS spray being used to restrain a mentally ill person in police custody. It raises important issues regarding the welfare of mentally ill people who happen to find themselves in contact with the police. There is a need for open debate, specific guidelines and a system of monitoring the use of CS in such situations.
ACE inhibitor therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, and need for revascularization in high-risk patients with clinical heart failure, overt left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or vascular disease. In patients with clinical heart failure or overt left ventricular systolic dysfunction, ACE inhibitor therapy also reduces the risk of sudden or arrhythmia-related cardiac death. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of the ACE inhibitor ramipril on sudden unexpected death or resuscitated cardiac arrest among the 9297 individuals without clinical heart failure or overt left ventricular dysfunction enrolled in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial.
ABCA1 mediates cellular cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to apolipoprotein A-I and other apolipoprotein acceptors. In this study, we analyzed the effect of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A on the ABCA1-mediated lipid effluxes reactions.
CYP2J2 is abundant in cardiomyocytes and is involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which affect multiple cell functions. In this study, we investigated the effect of overexpression of CYP2J2 on cardiac L-type Ca2+ currents (ICa) in adult transgenic mice. Cardiac-specific overexpression of CYP2J2 was achieved using the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter. ICa was recorded from isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes. Compared with the wild-type cardiomyocytes (n = 60), the density of ICa was significantly increased by 40 +/- 9% in the CYP2J2 transgenic cardiomyocytes (n = 71; P < 0.001). N-Methylsulfonyl-6-(2-proparglyloxyphenyl)hexanamide (MS-PPOH), a specific inhibitor of EET biosynthesis, and clotrimazole, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, significantly reduced ICa in both wild-type and transgenic cardiomyocytes; however, MS-PPOH inhibited ICa to a greater extent in the CYP2J2 transgenic cells (n = 10) than in the wild-type cells (n = 10; P < 0.01). Addition of 11,12-EET significantly restored ICa in MS-PPOH-treated cells. Intracellular dialysis with either of two inhibitory monoclonal antibodies against CYP2J2 significantly reduced ICa in both wild-type and transgenic mice. Membrane-permeable 8-bromo-cAMP and the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol significantly reversed the monoclonal antibody-induced inhibition of ICa. In addition, the total protein level of the alpha1 subunit of the Cav1.2 L-type Ca2+ channel was not altered in CYP2J2 transgenic hearts, but the phosphorylated portion was markedly increased. In conclusion, overexpression of CYP2J2 increases ICa in CYP2J2 transgenic cardiomyocytes via a mechanism that involves cAMP-protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the L-type Ca2+ channel.
ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) occurs almost exclusively in infants of blood group A or B who are born to group O mothers because IgG anti-A or -B occurs more commonly in group O than in group A or B individuals. We report a case in which clinically significant ABO-HDN occurred in a group B neonate from anti-B of a group A2 mother. The IgG anti-B titer was much higher (256) than that found in a group A1 mother/infant control group (</= 32). The maternal antibody screen was negative and antibodies to low-frequency antigens were not detected. Therefore, when evaluating unexplained HDN in a group B newborn of a group A mother, it may be relevant to determine the subgroup of the mother. As presented here, anti-B from a group A2 mother may, on occasion, be responsible for HDN.
"CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 exhibit significant overlap in substrate specificity but can differ in product regioselectivity and formation activity. To further explore this issue, we compared the kinetics of product formation for eight different substrates, using heterologously expressed CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 and phenotyped human liver microsomes. Both enzymes displayed allosteric behavior toward six of the substrates. When it occurred, the ""maximal"" intrinsic clearance was used for quantitative comparisons. Based on this parameter, CYP3A5 was more active than CYP3A4 in catalyzing total midazolam hydroxylation (3-fold) and lidocaine demethylation (1.4-fold). CYP3A5 exhibited comparable metabolic activity as CYP3A4 (90-110%) toward dextromethorphan N-demethylation and carbamazepine epoxidation. CYP3A5-catalyzed erythromycin N-demethylation, total flunitrazepam hydroxylation, testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation, and terfenadine alcohol formation occurred with an intrinsic clearance that was less than 65% that of CYP3A4. Using two sets of human liver microsomes with equivalent CYP3A4-specific content but markedly different CYP3A5 content (group 1, predominantly CYP3A4; group 2, CYP3A4 + CYP3A5), we assessed the contribution of CYP3A5 to product formation rates determined at low substrate concentrations (< or = Km). Mean product formation rates for group 2 microsomes were 1.4- to 2.2-fold higher than those of group 1 (p < 0.05 for 5 of 8 substrates). After adjusting for CYP3A4 activity (itraconazole hydroxylation), mean product formation rates for group 2 microsomes were still significantly higher than those of group 1 (p < 0.05 for 3 substrates). We suggest that, under conditions when CYP3A5 content represents a significant fraction of the total hepatic CYP3A pool, the contribution of CYP3A5 to the clearance of some drugs may be an important source of interindividual variability."
ABO polymorphism at the gene level has been investigated by molecular methods, predominantly sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). We describe the application of the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotide (PCRSSO) method, which is considered to be more versatile for large sample numbers, compared with conventional ABO genotyping by PCR-RFLP. PCR-SSO, while maintaining accurate and reliable results, reduces costs and labor. A population of 155 random individuals was investigated for the three O alleles, O1, O1*, and O2. The allelic frequencies were 35 percent, 26 percent, and 5 percent, respectively. PCR-SSO results correlated completely with both serologic and PCRRFLP results.
ABO discrepancy was noted when a patient's unwashed saline red cell suspension was tested with monoclonal ABO reagents. The discrepancy was resolved when a washed (X 3) saline red cell suspension was used in repeat testing. The patient's serum contained an autoagglutinin that reacted optimally below pH 7.0. The discrepancy occurred when monoclonal ABO reagents, formulated at a low pH, lowered the pH of the reaction mixture, and autoagglutination was observed.
SI joint dislocations are serious injuries. They are often associated with posterior fractures or anterior ring disruptions. This case report documents the outcome of a patient with an uncommon injury involving bilateral SI joint dislocation without associated anterior pelvic injuries or posterior pelvic fracture.
PTEN is a dual-specificity phosphatase with both protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activity. PTEN is the first phosphatase identified as a tumor suppressor. Not since the discovery of p53 has a tumor suppressor generated such interest. Initial studies performed on cancer cell lines suggested that PTEN may be responsible for almost all types of cancer, both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Biallelic deletion of PTEN has been associated with advanced stage tumors or metastatic disease. PTEN has been shown to play a pivotal role in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and possibly cell migration. Emerging data suggest that this may be an oversimplification of PTEN's role, and that PTEN may be haploinsufficient for tumor progression and may play important roles in other cellular functions such as angiogenesis and MAP kinase signaling.
CYP2S1 is a recently discovered member of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene superfamily. Interestingly, even though the DNA sequence identifies it as the sole member of the new CYP2S family, CYP2S1 exhibits many features typical to CYP1 family members, e.g. dioxin-inducibility mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). In addition, CYP2S1 metabolises some aromatic hydrocarbons as well as cellular substances. These characteristics, together with a wide extrahepatic tissue distribution, suggest that CYP2S1 may have an important role in both exogenous and endogenous metabolism. This is the first study characterising CYP2S1 alleles and naming them with the recommended CYP allele nomenclature. We used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and direct sequencing to investigate genetic variation of CYP2S1 in 100 male Finnish Caucasians. Those exons in which variation was found were examined in subsequent 100 subjects. The coding region of all of the nine exons, as well as a 449 bp fragment of the proximal promoter region, was analysed. This systematic investigation revealed eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which comprise nine different variant alleles (haplotypes), in addition to the wild-type allele. Seven of the SNPs occurred in the protein-coding areas and one in the proximal 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). Two of these sequence variations (10347C > T and 13106C > T) result in non-conservative amino acid substitutions, i.e. Arg380Cys and Pro466Leu, respectively. The respective allelic variants, CYP2S1*2 ([10347C > T]) and CYP2S1*3 (13106C > T; 13255A > G]), occurred in our study population at frequencies of 0.50 and 3.75%, respectively. The most common of the variant alleles was CYP2S1*1H (23.8%), harbouring a 13255A > G substitution located in the 3'UTR.
ACHE affiliate-led hospitals participate in Cover the Uninsured Week.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene mapped on chromosome 10q23.3 and encodes a dual specificity phosphatase. PTEN has major implication in PI3 kinase (PI3K) signal transduction pathway and negatively controls PI3 phosphorylation. It has been reported to be implicated in cell cycle progression and cell death control through inhibition of PI3K-Akt signal transduction pathway and in the control of cell migration and spreading through its interaction with focal adhesion kinase. Somatic mutations of PTEN are frequently detected in several cancer types including brain, prostate and endometrium with more than 30% of tumor tissue specimens bearing PTEN mutations and/or deletions. Because of its high frequency of mutations and its important function as tumor suppressor gene, PTEN is a good candidate for gene therapy. Inducible expression of PTEN has been also reported. In cancer cells bearing PTEN abnormalities, the reversion of PTEN function by external gene transfer becomes more and more investigated in cancer treatment research. Several technologies including the photochemical internalization (PCI) and aiming at improving the transfection efficiency have been reported. PCI is an innovative procedure based on light-induced delivery of macromolecules such as DNA, proteins and other therapeutic molecules from endocytic vesicles to the cytosol of target cells. PCI has been reported to enhance the gene delivery potential of viral and nonviral vectors. The present study was designed to evaluate the influence of photochemical internalization on polyethylenimine (PEI)-mediated PTEN gene transfer and its effects on the cellular viability in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells bearing PTEN abnormalities. PCI was found to significantly (P < 0.01) enhance PTEN mRNA expression (4.2 fold increase). Subsequently, following PEI-mediated PTEN gene transfer, the restoration of the PTEN protein expression was observed. As a consequence, significant cell growth inhibition (44%) was observed in Ishikawa endometrial cells. Using PCI for PEI-mediated PTEN gene transfer was found to further enhance PTEN mRNA and protein expression as well as PTEN-related cell growth inhibition reaching 89%.
CYP1A1 plays an important role in the metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), carcinogenic components of air pollution. The influence of CYP1A1 genotype (*2A, *2B and *4) on the levels of lymphocyte bulky DNA adducts and the frequency of cells with aberrant chromosomes was assessed in 194 non-smoking subjects in whom recent exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and airborne particulate-associated PAH were measured during two consecutive seasons (winter and summer). While CYP1A1*4 had no consistent effect on either biomarker of genetic damage, the levels of both biomarkers responded in a parallel fashion to changes in exposure/CYP1A1*2A genotype combinations during both seasons. Specifically, the levels of both biomarkers were increased in carriers of at least one CYP1A1*2A allele, as compared with CYP1A1*1 homozygotes, in subjects with ETS exposures >0.8 h/day during the previous 4 days and mean personal exposure to benzo[a]pyrene <0.9 ng/m3 during the previous 24 h (all P < 0.05). Outside these exposure limits the differential effect in CYP1A1*2A variants was lost. Although the numbers of subjects with the CYP1A1*2B polymorphism was small, the same trend appeared to be followed in this case. These effects are interpreted as resulting from differential induction of CYP1A1 expression in CYP1A1*2A and CYP1A1*2A/*2B carriers by components of ETS-polluted air at levels of exposure readily suffered by large segments of the general population and suggest that subjects with these genotypes may have increased susceptibility to the genotoxic effects of ETS.
CFTR is a cyclic AMP and nucleotide-related chloride-selective channel with a low unitary conductance. Many of the physiological roles of CFTR are effectively studied in intact cells and tissues. However, there are also several clear advantages to the application of cell-free technologies to the study of the biochemical and biophysical properties of CFTR. When expressed in heterologous cells, CFTR is processed relatively poorly, depending, however, on the cell-type analysed. In some cells, only 20-25% of the protein which is initially synthesized exits the endoplasmic reticulum to insert into the cell membrane [Cell 83 (1995) 121; EMBO J. 13 (1994) 6076]. Further, many of the disease-causing mutants of CFTR result in even lower processing efficiencies. Therefore, several procedures have been developed to study regulated CFTR channel function expressed in microsomal membranes and following its purification and reconstitution. These experimental approaches and their application are discussed here.
SOD1 is one of several overexpressed genes in Down's syndrome. In order to dissect genetic causes of the syndrome, hemizygous human wild-type SOD1 transgenic mice were compared to FVB/N non-transgenic controls at 3 months of age in the SHIRPA primary screen of neurologic function as well as in tests of motor activity and coordination. The responsiveness of SOD1/wt transgenic mice to visual and somatosensory stimuli was reduced in placing, pinna, corneal, and toe-pinch tests. In addition, SOD1/wt transgenic mice crossed fewer segments on a stationary beam. On the contrary, there was no intergroup difference for motor activity and anxiety in open-field and emergence tests and for latencies before falling on the stationary beam, coat-hanger, and rotorod. These results indicate mild deficits in sensorimotor responsiveness in a mouse model expressing human SOD1 and that the overexpressed gene may be responsible for some Down symptoms.
ABCA3 is highly expressed at the membrane of lamellar bodies in alveolar type II cells, in which pulmonary surfactant is stored. ABCA3 gene mutations cause fatal surfactant deficiency in newborns. We established HEK293 cells stably expressing human ABCA3 and analyzed the function. Exogenously expressed ABCA3 is glycosylated and localized at the intracellular vesicle membrane. ABCA3 is efficiently photoaffinity labeled by 8-azido-[alpha(32)P]ATP, but not by 8-azido-[gamma(32)P]ATP, when the membrane fraction is incubated in the presence of orthovanadate. Photoaffinity labeling of ABCA3 shows unique metal ion-dependence and is largely reduced by membrane pretreatment with 5% methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, which depletes cholesterol. Electron micrographs show that HEK293/hABCA3 cells contain multivesicular, lamellar body-like structures, which do not exist in HEK293 host cells. Some fuzzy components such as lipids accumulate in the vesicles. These results suggest that ABCA3 shows ATPase activity, which is induced by lipids, and may be involved in the biogenesis of lamellar body-like structures.
CD36 is expressed on multiple cell types and has numerous functions, a subset of which can impact on atherogenesis. In previous work, we demonstrated that CD36 absence was protective against lesion formation. The current objective was to determine whether absence of macrophage CD36 alone was protective.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene implicated in both sporadic cancers and inherited tumor-prone syndromes. Here we show that pten+/- mice display a partially penetrant embryonic lethality. This lethality is associated with defects in both neural and placental development. Notably, this lethality is completely rescued by grb2 haploinsufficiency. In contrast, grb2 heterozygosity did not alter tumorigenesis in either pten+/- or T cell-specific pten-/- mice. grb2-/hypomorph murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) show decreased activation of both PKB and Erk upon stimulation with epidermal growth factor, whereas grb2-/hypomorph; pten+/- MEFs activate PKB but not Erk normally. Similarly, grb2-/hypomorph fibroblasts die in low serum, and this phenotype is rescued by pten haploinsufficiency. Activation of both PKB and Erk as well as survival in low serum-containing media are all rescued by reexpression of Grb2 containing mutations within the N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, but not by C-terminal SH3 domain mutants. The N-terminal SH3 domain mutants fail to bind to Sos, whereas the C-terminal SH3 domain mutants fail to bind to Gab1, suggesting that Erk and PKB activation in fibroblasts in response to epidermal growth factor depends on Gab1 or other C-terminal SH3 domain-interacting proteins, but not on Sos. Thus, PTEN/phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase signaling requires Grb2 during both embryonic development and fibroblast survival, but Grb2 heterozygosity does not effect tumorigenesis in pten-deficient mice. In fibroblasts, survival signals emanating from the epidermal growth factor receptor appear to be PKB-dependent, and this activation depends on the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2, likely through the interaction of Grb2 with Gab1.
CYP2D6 is of great importance for the metabolism of clinically used drugs and about 20-25% of those are metabolised by this enzyme. In addition, the enzyme utilises hydroxytryptamines as endogenous substrates. The polymorphism of the enzyme results in poor, intermediate, efficient or ultrarapid metabolisers (UMs) of CYP2D6 drugs. It is plausible that the UM genotype, where more than one active gene on one allele occurs, is the outcome of selective dietary selection in certain populations in North East Africa. The UM phenotype affects 5.5% of the population in Western Europe. A hypothesis for the evolutionary basis behind selection for CYP2D6 gene duplications is presented in relation to selection for Cyp6 variants in insecticide resistant Drosophila strains. The polymorphism of CYP2D6 significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of about 50% of the drugs in clinical use, which are CYP2D6 substrates. The consequences of the polymorphism at ordinary drug doses can be either adverse drug reactions or no drug response. Examples are presented where CYP2D6 polymorphism affects the efficacy and costs of drug treatment. Predictive CYP2D6 genotyping is estimated by the author to be beneficial for treatment of about 30-40% of CYP2D6 drug substrates, that is, for about 7-10% of all drugs clinically used, although prospective clinical studies are necessary to evaluate the exact benefit of drug selection and dosage based on the CYP2D6 genotype.
GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol)-anchored proteins are characteristic components of biochemically defined lipid rafts. Rafts may be involved in T-cell stimulation, but it is not clear whether molecules involved in TCR (T-cell receptor) signalling are partitioned to T-cell synapses through raft microdomains or through specific protein-protein interactions. We have used FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) analysis to study the distribution of GPI-anchored fluorescent proteins in the plasma membrane of live cells. Multiple criteria suggested that FRET between different GPI-anchored fluorescent proteins in COS-7 or unstimulated Jurkat T-cells is generated by a random, unclustered distribution. Stimulation of TCR signalling in Jurkat T-cells by beads coated with antibodies against TCR subunits resulted in localized increases in fluorescence of raft markers. However, measurements of FRET and ratio imaging showed that there was no detectable clustering and no overall enrichment of raft markers in these regions.
CD38 is a cell surface molecule with ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity, which is predominantly expressed on lymphoid and myeloid cells. CD38 has a significant role in B-cell function as some anti-CD38 antibodies can deliver potent growth and differentiation signals, but the ligand that delivers this signal in mice is unknown. We used a chimeric protein of mouse CD38 and human immunogobulin G (IgG) (CD38-Ig) to identify a novel ligand for murine CD38 (CD38L) on networks of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) as well as dendritic cells (DCs) in the spleen. Flow-cytometry found that all DC subsets expressed cytoplasmic CD38L but only fresh ex vivo CD11c+ CD11b- DCs had cell surface CD38L. Anti-CD38 antibody blocked the binding of CD38-Ig to CD38L, confirming the specificity of detection. CD38-Ig immuno-precipitated ligands of 66 and 130 kDa. Functional studies found that CD38-Ig along with anti-CD40 and anti-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antibody provided maturation signals to DCs in vitro. When CD38-Ig was administered in vivo with antigen, IgG2a responses were significantly reduced, suggesting that B and T cells expressing CD38 may modulate the isotype of antibodies produced through interaction with CD38L on DCs. CD38-Ig also expanded FDC networks when administered in vivo. In conclusion, this study has identified a novel ligand for CD38 which has a role in functional interactions between lymphocytes and DCs or FDCs.
ACE inhibitors are known to ameliorate cardiovascular complications in aging; however, their effects on the coronary circulation in relation to aging and eNOS dependence remain to be examined. Coronary flow responses to bradykinin with or without ACE inhibitors were examined in Langendorff-perfused hearts from young (16-20 weeks) and aged (16-20 months) control and eNOS mice. Western blot analysis was performed for cardiac eNOS, nNOS, and ACE. Baseline coronary flow was comparable between young and aged mice of both strains. Aging did not affect bradykinin-induced coronary flow in either strain. Interestingly, both acute and chronic treatment with an ACE inhibitor markedly augmented the flow response in aged control and eNOS mice. Aged eNOS mice were markedly hypertensive and had larger ventricular mass than control mice. The antihypertensive effect of temocapril was greater in aged eNOS mice, associated with reduction in the ventricular weight in both strains. Western blot analysis demonstrated an increased expression of eNOS in aged control mice, and ACE expression was increased in eNOS mice. These results indicate that coronary flow response to bradykinin is preserved in aged mice even in the absence of eNOS, and an ACE inhibitor augments this response by both eNOS-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene encoding a phosphatase that negatively regulates cell survival mediated by the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway. The gene for transcription factor EGR-1 is an early response gene essential for cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Protein phosphatase inhibitors including calyculin A and okadaic acid are potent inducers of apoptosis in several cell lines; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying their action are unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression of PTEN and EGR-1 and the phosphorylation status of EGR-1 and Akt in calyculin A-treated human squamous carcinoma cells (SCCTF). Phosphorylation of EGR-1 and upregulation of PTEN expression were observed to occur in SCCTF cells treated with calyculin A in time- and dose-dependent fashions. The level of phosphorylated Akt decreased as the expression of PTEN protein increased in the calyculin A-treated SCCTF cells. Calyculin A-stimulated expression of EGR-1 and PTEN might be p53 independent, because the expression of them was also detected in p53-null Saos-2 cells. RNA interference using double-stranded RNA specific for the EGR-1 gene inhibited not only EGR-1 expression but also PTEN expression in SCCTF cells treated or not with calyculin A. Calyculin A induced nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation in SCCTF cells. The present results suggest that the level of PTEN expression and the phosphorylation status of Akt were associated with apoptosis induced by calyculin A. These observations also support the view that EGR-1 regulates PTEN expression in the initial steps of the apoptotic pathway.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) has been shown to be inactivated in a wide variety of cancers, and the role of this gene as a tumor suppressor has been well established. On the other hand, results of recent animal studies as well as clinical evidence indicate that PTEN is also involved in tumor metastasis suppression. Although PTEN is known to play a key role in controlling cell growth and apoptosis, how PTEN exerts the metastasis suppressor function remains largely unknown. Recently, a microarray analysis identified the Drg-1 gene (differentiation related gene 1) as one of the potential targets of PTEN. The Drg-1 gene has been shown to suppress tumor metastasis in animal models of prostate and colon cancer, and the expression of this gene is significantly reduced with advancement of prostate and breast cancers in clinical setting. In this study, we explored the possibility that PTEN controls tumor metastasis by regulating the expression of the Drg-1 gene. Our results indicate that overexpression of PTEN significantly augments the endogenous expression of Drg-1 protein, whereas inhibition of PTEN by small interfering RNA decreases Drg-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We also found that the control of the Drg-1 gene by PTEN seems to be at the transcriptional level, and that a phospho-Akt inhibitor restores the Drg-1 expression, indicating that PTEN controls Drg-1 by an Akt-dependent pathway. Consistent with these results, our immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PTEN expression correlates significantly with Drg-1 in both prostate and breast cancer cases. Furthermore, combination of the two markers, PTEN and Drg-1, emerged as a significantly better predictor of prostate and breast cancer patient survival than either marker alone.
CYP1B1 activates polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon carcinogens in cAMP-regulated tissues such as the adrenal, ovary, and testis. A 27-fold cAMP stimulation of the CYP1B1-luciferase reporter in Y-1 adrenal cells depends entirely on a far upstream enhancer region (FUER; -5298 to -5110). Cooperative participation of multiple steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) elements with the downstream cAMP response element (CRE) in FUER is essential for both basal and cAMP-stimulated activities of FUER. Basal and induced activities were similarly lowered by DAX-1, an SF-1 suppressor, and raised by steroid receptor coactivator 1, an SF-1 coactivator. cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) that interacts preferentially with the phosphorylated-CREB increased the cAMP-induced FUER. 10T1/2 cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells do not express SF-1. Introduction of exogenous SF-1 generated cAMP stimulation of the FUER in 10T1/2 fibroblasts. The same transfection only increased basal activity of FUER in HEK293 cells, despite presence of active CREB in cells. HEK293 cells therefore remain deficient in additional factor(s) critical to the cAMP stimulation of CYP1B1. Mutations of the protein kinase A (PKA) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation sites (Ser-430 and Ser-203) on SF-1 had no effect on the SF-1-dependent FUER stimulation in Y-1 and 10T1/2 cells. This contrasts with loss of activity with mutation of CREB at PKA phosphorylation site (Ser-133). SF-1 phosphorylation at these sites is therefore not essential for the cAMP stimulation and the cooperation with CREB. cAMP-enhanced activation protein 1 (AP-1) and stimulatory protein 1 (Sp1) complexes in the proximal promoter region contributed substantially to both basal and cAMP-stimulated FUER activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation from primary rat adrenal cells demonstrated cAMP stimulation of histone acetylation proximal to, respectively, the FUER and AP-1 sites of CYP1B1.
CD36 as a fatty acid transporter is predominantly expressed in adipocytes. We studied whether adipocytes could uptake and degrade OxLDL through CD36 and explored the effect of fenofibrate on OxLDL uptake in adipocytes from hypercholesterolemia rabbits.
"ACE inhibitor renal scintigraphy is widely accepted as a useful test in screening of unilateral renal artery stenosis. Another screening examination is ultrasonography, which detects haemodynamic changes with evaluation of resistive index (RI). The aim of the present study was correlation of 99mTc-DTPA captopril renography and duplex ultrasound findings in diagnosis of renal artery stenosis before angiography, that is used as ""gold standard"". Angiography was performed in 35 patients and their findings were correlated with scintigraphy and ultrasonography."
CYP27A1 (sterol 27-hydroxylase) catalyses an important sterol elimination pathway in the human macrophage, and consequently may protect against atherosclerosis. We studied the expression and regulation of CYP27A1 in a human macrophage-like cell-line, THP-1, and primary HMDMs (human monocyte-derived macrophages). In both macrophage cell types, we found that CYP27A1 expression is independent of cellular cholesterol levels and of LXR (liver X receptor)-dependent control of transcription. However, the RXR (retinoid X receptor) ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid, upregulates CYP27A1 expression. Of the RXR heterodimeric partners tested, PPAR (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor) gamma ligands significantly increased CYP27A1 mRNA levels. Its reversal by a PPARgamma antagonist demonstrated the specificity of this effect. Interestingly, HMDMs express markedly higher levels of CYP27A1 than THP-1 macrophages, and this difference was reflected in both protein levels and enzyme activities between the two cell types. In conclusion, stimulation of CYP27A1 by PPARgamma may represent a key previously unrecognized mechanism by which PPARgamma protects against atherosclerosis.
CYP1A1 expression in various tissues of 43 gastric cancer cases was analyzed with frozen tissue array-based immunohistochemical staining (IHC), RT-PCR, Western blot analysis and EROD (7-ethoxyresourfin-O-deethylase) assay. CYP1A1 was detected immunohistochemically in 86% (37/43) of gastric cancers, in both 57% (4/7) of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia and in 7.7% (1/13) of non-cancerous mucosa. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed coincident results with that of IHC and ruled out possible concurrent CYP1A2 expression. EROD assay showed increased CYP1A1/1B1 activity in either cancer or premalignant tissues but not in non-cancerous ones. The frequencies of CYP1A1 expression are significantly different between non-cancerous and premalignant (P<0.025) or cancer groups (P<0.005), suggesting that CYP1A1 is expressed at relatively early stage of gastrocarcinogenesis and exerts its effects throughout the stepwise oncogenic processes.
CD38 is an ADP-ribosyl cyclase, producing a potent Ca(2+) mobilizer cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR). In this study, we have investigated a role of CD38 and its regulation through interleukin-8 (IL8) signaling in lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. Incubation of LAK cells with IL8 resulted in an increase of cellular cADPR level and a rapid rise of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), which was sustained for a long period of time (>10 min). Preincubation of an antagonistic cADPR analog, 8-Br-cADPR (8-bromo-cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose), abolished the sustained Ca(2+) signal only but not the initial Ca(2+) rise. An inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptor antagonist blocked both Ca(2+) signals. Interestingly, the sustained Ca(2+) rise was not observed in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+). Functional CD38-null (CD38(-)) LAK cells showed the initial rapid increase of [Ca(2+)](i) but not the sustained Ca(2+) rise in response to IL8 treatment. An increase of cellular cADPR level by cGMP analog, 8-pCPT-cGMP (8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-guanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate), but not cAMP analog or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was observed. IL8 treatment resulted in the increase of cGMP level that was inhibited by the IP(3) receptor blocker but not a protein kinase C inhibitor. cGMP-mediated Ca(2+) rise was blocked by 8-Br-cADPR. In addition, IL8-mediated LAK cell migration was inhibited by 8-Br-cADPR and a protein kinase G inhibitor. Consistent with these observations, IL8-induced migration of CD38(-) LAK cells was not observed. However, direct application of cADPR or 8-pCPT-cGMP stimulated migration of CD38(-) cells. These results demonstrate that CD38 is stimulated by sequential activation of IL8 receptor, IP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) rise, and cGMP/protein kinase G and that CD38 plays an essential role in IL8-induced migration of LAK cells.
ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and PDE5 (phosphodiesterase type 5) inhibitors have each been reported to improve endothelial function in cardiovascular disease patients, but the comparative and combined effects of these two classes have not been studied previously. We sought to characterize the acute effects of ramipril alone, sildenafil alone, or their combination on endothelial function in patients with CHF (chronic heart failure). CHF subjects (n=64) were randomized to receive placebo, 10 mg of ramipril alone, 50 mg of sildenafil alone or a combination of ramipril and sildenafil in a double-blind manner. FMD (flow-mediated dilation) of the brachial artery was determined by high-resolution ultrasound imaging before and at 1, 2 and 4 h after administration of the study drug. Ramipril alone increased FMD at 4 h compared with placebo (+2.3+/-1.3%, P=0.02). Sildenafil alone increased FMD at 1, 2 and 4 h compared with placebo (+3.9+/-1.4, +4.6+/-1.8 and +3.7+/-1.3% respectively, all P<0.02). Sildenafil in combination with ramipril increased FMD at 1, 2 and 4 h when compared with placebo (+3.5+/-1.5, +4.5+/-1.8 and +4.8+/-1.3% respectively, all P<0.03). Ramipril and sildenafil both acutely improved FMD in patients with CHF, with additive effects evident at 4 h during combination therapy. Therefore further work to characterize chronic effects of combined ACE and PDE5 inhibition on endothelial function are warranted.
SLC26A6 (PAT1, CFEX) is an anion exchanger that is expressed on the apical membrane of the kidney proximal tubule and the small intestine. Modes of transport mediated by SLC26A6 include Cl-/formate exchange, Cl-/HCO3- exchange, and Cl-/oxalate exchange. To study its role in kidney and intestinal physiology, gene targeting was used to prepare mice lacking Slc26a6. Homozygous mutant Slc26a6-/- mice appeared healthy and exhibited a normal blood pressure, kidney function, and plasma electrolyte profile. In proximal tubules microperfused with a low-HCO3-/high-Cl- solution, the baseline rate of fluid absorption (Jv), an index of NaCl transport under these conditions, was the same in wild-type and null mice. However, the stimulation of Jv by oxalate observed in wild-type mice was completely abolished in Slc26a6-null mice (P<0.05). Formate stimulation of Jv was partially reduced in null mice, but the difference from the response in wild-type mice did not reach statistical significance. Apical membrane Cl-/base exchange activity, assayed with the pH-sensitive dye BCPCF in microperfused proximal tubules, was decreased by 58% in Slc26a6-/- animals (P<0.001 vs. wild types). In the duodenum, the baseline rate of HCO3- secretion measured in mucosal tissue mounted in Ussing chambers was decreased by approximately 30% (P<0.03), whereas the forskolin-stimulated component of HCO3- secretion was the same in wild-type and Slc26a6-/- mice. We conclude that Slc26a6 mediates oxalate-stimulated NaCl absorption, contributes to apical membrane Cl-/base exchange in the kidney proximal tubule, and also plays an important role in HCO3- secretion in the duodenum.
OTC deficiency, the most common urea cycle defect, is transmitted as a partially dominant X-linked trait. The most severe form of the disease, however, is usually restricted to males. We report on monozygotic female twins with severe neonatal-onset OTC deficiency and a de novo balanced reciprocal translocation t(X;5)(p21.1;q11). Disruption of the OTC gene on the derivative X-chromosome was confirmed by FISH analysis. Consistent inactivation of the normal X could be demonstrated by RGB staining. Manifestation of X-linked recessive disorders in females due to a balanced reciprocal X-autosome translocation has previously been described in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and several other disorders but not in OTC deficiency. This report emphasizes the importance of chromosome analysis in any female manifesting severe OTC deficiency.
SLC26A8 is an anion transporter that is solely expressed in the testes. It interacts with MgcRacGAP that shows strong structural similarity with the Drosophila protein RotundRacGAP, which is established to have an essential role for male fertility in the fruit fly. To explore whether the SLC26A8 gene has a role in human male infertility, we performed mutational analysis in the coding region of the SLC26A8 gene in 83 male infertility patients and two groups of controls using single-strand conformational polymorphism and direct sequencing methods. We found six novel coding sequence variations, of which five lead to amino acid substitutions. All variants were found with similar frequencies in both patients and controls, thus suggesting that none of them may be causally associated with infertility. We conclude that the SLC26A8 mutations are not a common cause of male infertility.
PTEN is a frequently mutated tumor suppressor in malignancies. Interestingly, some malignancies exhibit undetectable PTEN protein without mutations or loss of PTEN mRNA. The cause(s) for this reduction in PTEN is unknown. Cancer cells frequently exhibit loss of cadherin, beta-catenin, alpha-catenin and/or vinculin, key elements of adherens junctions. Here we show that F9 vinculin-null (vin(-/-)) cells lack PTEN protein despite normal PTEN mRNA levels. Their PTEN protein expression was restored by transfection with vinculin or by inhibition of PTEN degradation. F9 vin(-/-) cells express PTEN protein upon transfection with a vinculin fragment (amino acids 243-1066) that is capable of interacting with alpha-catenin but unable to target into focal adhesions. On the other hand, disruption of adherens junctions with an E-cadherin blocking antibody reduced PTEN protein to undetectable levels in wild-type F9 cells. PTEN protein levels were restored in F9 vin(-/-) cells upon transfection with an E-cadherin-alpha-catenin fusion protein, which targets into adherens junctions and interacts with beta-catenin in F9 vin(-/-) cells. beta-Catenin is known to interact with MAGI-2. MAGI-2 interaction with PTEN in the cell membrane is known to prevent PTEN protein degradation. Thus, MAGI-2 overexpression in F9 vin(-/-) cells restored PTEN protein levels. Moreover, expression of vinculin mutants that reinstated the disrupted interactions of beta-catenin with MAGI-2 in F9 vin(-/-) cells also restored PTEN protein levels. These studies indicate that PTEN protein levels are dependent on the maintenance of beta-catenin-MAGI-2 interaction, in which vinculin plays a critical role.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) and p53 alterations were expected to be diversely involved in endometrial carcinogenesis. Patients (n=92) with endometrial carcinoma (EC) were analyzed, and PTEN and p53 were immunostained in the tissue sections. Tumor histology, grade of differentiation, presence of endometrial hyperplasia, staining status of PTEN and p53 and clinical information were examined. There were 37 cases (40%) negative for PTEN staining, which suggests lost or reduced PTEN function. Loss of PTEN staining was significantly related to the advanced staging in the grade 1 (G1) and grade 2 (G2) endometrioid adenocarcinoma group (p=0.026). Also, 18 cases (20%) showed positive staining for p53. p53 staining was largely found in grade 3 (G3) endometrioid adenocarcinoma and other phenotypes of EC. In the G1 and G2 group, all 29 cases with reduced PTEN staining showed p53-negative staining (p=0.025). In the G3 and others group, 6 of 8 cases with reduced PTEN staining showed p53-positive staining. p53-positive staining was associated with a high probability of tumor recurrence in the G1 and G2 group (p=0.0234). In contrast, in the G3 and others group, p53-positive cases had a low probability of tumor recurrence (p=0.0473). Both PTEN and p53 staining may be good indicators of clinical stage and probability of tumor recurrence in EC. Reciprocal abnormality of p53 or PTEN occurred at an early phase of carcinogenesis, however simultaneous abnormality of p53 and PTEN often occurred at the a late phase of carcinogenesis. Thus, immunohistochemistry for PTEN and p53 in biopsy specimens of EC can provide supportive information for determining a treatment plan.
SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) catalyses the conversion of saturated fatty acids into mono-unsaturated fatty acids, a critical step involved in lipid metabolism and various other biological functions. In the present study, we report the identification and characterization of a human gene that encodes a novel SCD enzyme (hSCD2). The hSCD2 gene codes for a 37.5-kDa protein that shares 61% and 57% sequence identity with the human SCD1 and mouse SCD2 enzymes respectively. The recombinant hSCD2 enzyme expressed in mammalian and Sf9 insect cells efficiently catalysed desaturation of both stearoyl- and palmitoyl-CoAs to the corresponding mono-unsaturated fatty acids. In comparison with the hSCD1 gene that is predominantly expressed in liver, hSCD2 is most abundantly expressed in pancreas and brain. Additionally, hSCD2 transcripts from adult and foetal tissues exhibit different sizes because of alternative splicing in the non-coding region, suggesting that hSCD2 expression is developmentally regulated. The recombinant human SCD2 and SCD1 transiently expressed in COS-7 cells exhibited as oligomeric proteins that consist of homodimers and oligomers when resolved by SDS/PAGE. The complex formation was independent of SCD protein expression levels, as supported by a relatively constant ratio of the level of dimers and oligomers to that of the monomers from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with different amounts of SCD expression vectors. Furthermore, treatment of intact COS-7 cells with a cross-linking reagent resulted in dose-dependent increases in the levels of SCD protein and activity, suggesting that oligomerization may play an important role in regulating the stability of SCD enzymes.
CD38 is an approximately 45-kDa type II transmembrane glycoprotein expressed by hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. Its surface expression is under complex control and varies during lymphocyte development, activation, and differentiation, suggesting an important role in these processes. Murine CD38 has been mainly characterized on B lymphocytes, and in humans, the molecule has been studied in T cells. This paper provides evidences that murine CD38 is regulated tightly during T cell activation and differentiation. On the periphery, a subset of mature T lymphocytes was identified by the expression of CD38. These cells showed an activated phenotype; they were larger and more granular than their negative counterparts. In accord with this observation, in vitro-activated T cells up-regulated CD38. Memory T lymphocytes also were CD38-positive. It is interesting that T cells expressing high levels of CD38 had a reduced, proliferative capacity but displayed an improved potential to produce interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma, suggesting a role of this molecule during T cell activation and differentiation.
ABO incompatible kidney transplantations have previously only been performed after several preoperative sessions of plasmapheresis and splenectomy, with the conventional triple-drug immunosuppressive protocol being reinforced with antilymphocyte globulin and B-cell-specific drugs, such as cyclophosphamide or deoxyspergualine. We have designed a protocol without splenectomy, based on antigen-specific immunoadsorption, rituximab and a conventional triple-drug immunosuppressive protocol. The protocol calls for a 10-day pretransplantation conditioning period, starting with one dosage of rituximab and followed by full dose tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. Antigen-specific immunoadsorption was performed on pretransplantation days -6, -5, -2 and -1. After the last session, 0.5 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered. Postoperatively, three more apheresis sessions were given every third day. Furthermore, if there was a significant increase in the antibody titers, extra sessions were considered. Eleven patients have received transplants with this protocol. The ABO antibodies were readily removed by the antigen-specific immunoadsorption and were kept at a low level post-transplantation by further adsorptions. There were no side effects and all patients have normal renal transplant function. We conclude that after an infusion each of rituximab and IVIG, and antigen-specific immunoadsorption; blood group-incompatible renal transplantations can be performed with excellent results using standard immunosuppression and no splenectomy.
NSDHL is a 3beta-hydroxysterol dehydrogenase that is involved in the removal of C-4 methyl groups in one of the later steps of cholesterol biosynthesis. Mutations in the Nsdhl gene are associated with the X-linked male lethal mouse mutations bare patches (Bpa) and striated (Str), as well as with most cases of human CHILD syndrome. To begin to examine the pathogenesis of these disorders, we have determined that affected male embryos for several Nsdhl alleles die in midgestation, between E10.5 and 13.5, while the majority of affected male embryos for the most severe allele, Nsdhl(Bpa1H), die prior to E9.5. Although no consistent anomalies were identified in affected male embryos themselves, the labyrinth layer of the fetal placenta was always thinner, with fewer fetal vessels and decreased proliferation of labyrinth trophoblast cells. X-inactivation is non-random in females in most lineages of the rodent placenta with preferential inactivation of the paternal X chromosome. For primary defects involving these extraembryonic lineages, heterozygous females with a mutant maternal X chromosome would be expected to have an identical placental phenotype to that found in affected male embryos. We hypothesize that abnormalities in cells of the allantoic mesoderm that undergo random X-inactivation and form the endothelial lining of the fetal vessels of the labyrinth are associated with the male lethality, perhaps through disruption of an as yet unidentified signaling pathway.
SPR is a technique performed to detect latent fingerprints left on wet surfaces, based upon the reaction between the fatty components present in the traces and hydrophobic tails of the specific reagents. These tails are linked to a hydrophilic head, which reacts with metal salt to give a white or black precipitate. The literature reports that it is possible identifying latent fingerprints with cyanoacrylate fuming procedure, after drying the surface, but you cannot always do it. In the present report we want to show a casework that can concern a find completely dust covered.
RRM1 is a gene crucial for determination of the tumor phenotype. It encodes the regulatory subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, and it is a molecular target of gemcitabine. In addition, RRM1 induces PTEN expression and inhibits cell migration, invasion, and metastasis formation. In patients with resected lung cancers, increased levels of RRM1 are highly associated with long survival. In contrast, patients on gemcitabine and cisplatin therapy for advanced disease have a poor survival if RRM1 expression is high presumably because of decreased efficacy of chemotherapy. We analyzed the RRM1 promoter for polymorphisms in an effort to develop a practical and inexpensive assay for RRM1 expression. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms, RR37 and RR524, were discovered. These polymorphisms impacted promoter activity in vitro and had different frequencies in various populations. Promoter allelotypes were highly associated with overall (P = 0.06) and disease-free (P = 0.03) patient survival. The allelotype with the highest predicted activity was associated with the best patient outcome. However, we did not find an association between allelotype and tumoral RRM1 expression. This is likely a result of the limited impact of the described promoter polymorphisms on overall in vivo gene expression. We conclude that clinical studies using RR37 and RR524 for decisions on chemotherapy are premature and that further functional studies on the RRM1 promoter are required to fully elucidate factors controlling RRM1 expression.
CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), the protein whose dysfunction causes cystic fibrosis, is a chloride ion channel whose gating is controlled by interactions of MgATP with CFTR's two cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains, but only after several serines in CFTR's regulatory (R) domain have been phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Whereas eight R-domain serines have previously been shown to be phosphorylated in purified CFTR, it is not known how individual phosphoserines regulate channel gating, although two of them, at positions 737 and 768, have been suggested to be inhibitory. Here we show, using mass spectrometric analysis, that Ser 768 is the first site phosphorylated in purified R-domain protein, and that it and five other R-domain sites are already phosphorylated in resting Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type (WT) human epithelial CFTR. The WT channels have lower activity than S768A channels (with Ser 768 mutated to Ala) in resting oocytes, confirming the inhibitory influence of phosphoserine 768. In excised patches exposed to a range of PKA concentrations, the open probability (P(o)) of mutant S768A channels exceeded that of WT CFTR channels at all [PKA], and the half-maximally activating [PKA] for WT channels was twice that for S768A channels. As the open burst duration of S768A CFTR channels was almost double that of WT channels, at both low (55 nM) and high (550 nM) [PKA], we conclude that the principal mechanism by which phosphoserine 768 inhibits WT CFTR is by hastening the termination of open channel bursts. The right-shifted P(o)-[PKA] curve of WT channels might explain their slower activation, compared with S768A channels, at low [PKA]. The finding that phosphorylation kinetics of WT or S768A R-domain peptides were similar provides no support for an alternative explanation, that early phosphorylation of Ser 768 in WT CFTR might also impair subsequent phosphorylation of stimulatory R-domain serines. The observed reduced sensitivity to activation by [PKA] imparted by Ser 768 might serve to ensure activation of WT CFTR by strong stimuli while dampening responses to weak signals.
CYP2D6 polymorphism of drug metabolism represents an important source of interindividual and interethnic variation in drug response. Since this polymorphism has not been studied in an Iranian population, the present study was undertaken.
PRODH maps to 22q11 in the region deleted in the velocardiofacial syndrome/DiGeorge syndrome (VCFS/DGS) and encodes proline oxidase (POX), a mitochondrial inner-membrane enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the proline degradation pathway. At least 16 PRODH missense mutations have been identified in studies of type I hyperprolinemia (HPI) and schizophrenia, 10 of which are present at polymorphic frequencies. The functional consequences of these missense mutations have been inferred by evolutionary conservation, but none have been tested directly. Here, we report the effects of these mutations on POX activity. We find that four alleles (R185Q, L289M, A455S, and A472T) result in mild (<30%), six (Q19P, A167V, R185W, D426N, V427M, and R431H) in moderate (30%-70%), and five (P406L, L441P, R453C, T466M, and Q521E) in severe (>70%) reduction in POX activity, whereas one (Q521R) increases POX activity. The POX encoded by one severe allele (T466M) shows in vitro responsiveness to high cofactor (flavin adenine dinucleotide) concentrations. Although there is limited information on plasma proline levels in individuals of known PRODH genotype, extant data suggest that severe hyperprolinemia (>800 microM) occurs in individuals with large deletions and/or PRODH missense mutations with the most-severe effect on function (L441P and R453C), whereas modest hyperprolinemia (300-500 microM) is associated with PRODH alleles with a moderate reduction in activity. Interestingly, three of the four alleles associated with or found in schizophrenia (V427M, L441P, and R453C) resulted in severe reduction of POX activity and hyperprolinemia. These observations plus the high degree of polymorphism at the PRODH locus are consistent with the hypothesis that reduction in POX function is a risk factor for schizophrenia.
SLC5A8 is a candidate tumour suppressor gene that is silenced in colon cancer, gastric cancer and possibly other cancers in humans. This gene codes for a transporter belonging to the Na(+)/glucose co-transporter gene family (SLC5). The cancer-associated silencing of the gene involves hypermethylation of CpG islands present in exon 1 of the gene. SLC5A8 is expressed in colon, ileum, kidney and thyroid gland. The protein coded by the gene mediates the Na(+)-coupled and electrogenic transport of a variety of monocarboxylates, including short-chain fatty acids, lactate and nicotinate. It may also transport iodide. The normal physiological function of this transporter in the intestinal tract and kidney is likely to facilitate the active absorption of short-chain fatty acids, lactate and nicotinate. One of the short-chain fatty acids that serves as a substrate for SLC5A8 is butyrate. This fatty acid is an inhibitor of histone deacetylases and is known to induce apoptosis in a variety of tumours including colonic tumour. Since butyrate is produced in the colonic lumen at high concentrations by bacterial fermentation of dietary fibre, we speculate that the ability of SLC5A8 to mediate the entry of this short-chain fatty acid into colonic epithelial cells underlies the potential tumour suppressor function of this transporter.
CD36 is an important regulator of lipid metabolism in vivo due to its role in the facilitated uptake of long-chain FAs (fatty acids). CD36-deficient mice display reduced TAG (triacylglycerol) in muscle, but elevated hepatic TAG. Also, insulin sensitivity is enhanced peripherally, while it appears impaired in the liver. Tissues such as muscle, which normally express high levels of CD36, shift to high glucose utilization in CD36 deficiency, so we hypothesized that this shift must involve adaptive changes in the PPAR (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor) transcription factors which regulate FA metabolism. To test this, we examined mRNA levels for the three PPAR isoforms in tissues of WT (wild-type) and CD36-deficient mice following the administration of saline, glucose or olive oil by intragastric gavage. Compared with WT mice, CD36-null mice had 5-10-fold increased PPAR mRNA in adipose tissue in the basal state, and did not exhibit diet-induced changes. Correlations between adipose PPAR mRNA abundance and plasma lipids were observed in WT mice, but not in CD36-null mice. The opposite was true for hepatic PPAR mRNA levels, which correlated with plasma FA, TAG and/or glucose only in CD36-null mice. No significant differences were observed in PPAR mRNA levels in the intestine, where CD36 does not impact on FA uptake. The data suggest that CD36 and the PPARs are components of the FA-sensing machinery to respond to changes in FA flux in a tissue-specific manner.
CD36 is a multifunctional membrane receptor widely expressed in different tissues which binds and internalizes oxidized low-density lipoprotein. In rodents, CD36 gene variations modulate glucose homeostasis and contribute to metabolic syndrome associated with type 2 diabetes but the effects in human are unknown.
CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus die 2-3 days following transient forebrain ischemia, whereas CA3 pyramidal neurons and granule cells in the dentate gyrus remain viable. Excitotoxicity is the major cause of ischemic cell death, and potassium currents play important roles in regulating the neuronal excitability. The present study compared the changes of potassium currents in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons at different intervals after ischemia. In CA1 neurons, the amplitude of rapid inactivating potassium currents (I(A)) was significantly increased at 14 h and returned to control levels at 38 h after ischemia; the rising slope and decay time constant of I(A) were accordingly increased after ischemia. The activation curve of I(A) in CA1 neurons shifted to the depolarizing direction at 38 h after ischemia. In granule cells, the amplitude and rising slope of I(A) were significantly increased at 38 h after ischemia; the inactivation curves of I(A) shifted toward the depolarizing direction accordingly at 38 h after ischemia. The I(A) remained unchanged in CA3 neurons after ischemia. The amplitudes of delayed rectifier potassium currents (I(Kd)) in CA1 neurons were progressively increased after ischemia. No significant difference in I(Kd) was detected in CA3 and granule cells at any time points after reperfusion. These results indicated that the voltage dependent potassium currents in hippocampal neurons were differentially altered after cerebral ischemia. The up-regulation of I(A) in dentate granule cells might have protective effects. The increase of I(Kd) in CA1 neurons might be associated with the neuronal damage after ischemia.
WWOX is a cancer gene, spanning the common chromosomal fragile site 16D. Genomic and expression aberrations affecting this gene and locus are common in various neoplasias including breast cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between WWOX expression at the protein level with respect to clinico-pathological characteristics. We performed immunohistochemical analyses on breast specific tissue microarrays representing, human normal breast epithelium (n = 16), ductal carcinoma in situ (n = 15) and invasive breast cancer cases (n = 203). Staining intensity measurements were objectively determined utilizing an image analysis system. Western blot analyses were also performed on an independent set of 23 invasive breast carcinomas. All normal breast epithelial samples express WWOX protein abundantly while 34% (69/203 cases) of invasive breast carcinomas were 'completely negative' for WWOX expression and an additional 26% (52/203) of cases expressed WWOX very weakly. For DCIS samples five out of 15 (33%) were negative or weak for WWOX staining. Interestingly, we found a statistically significant correlation between WWOX expression and estrogen receptor (ER) status, 27% of ER+ breast carcinomas were completely negative for WWOX expression versus 46% for ER-cases (p = 0.0054). Furthermore, when negative plus weakly WWOX stained cases were considered the difference became more significant with 51% of ER+ cases and 73% for the ER-group, with a p = 0.003. These data indicate that loss of WWOX expression is a common event in breast cancer. It is unclear at this point whether loss of WWOX expression is a consequence of tumor progression or represents a subclass of breast carcinomas. The strong association of WWOX expression with ER status reinforces the suggested role of this protein as an enzyme involved in sex steroid metabolism.
FN3K (fructosamine 3-kinase) is a mammalian enzyme that catalyses the phosphorylation of fructosamines, which thereby becomes unstable and detaches from proteins. The homologous mammalian enzyme, FN3K-RP (FN3K-related protein), does not phosphorylate fructosamines but ribulosamines, which are probably formed through a spontaneous reaction of amines with ribose 5-phosphate, an intermediate of the pentose-phosphate pathway and the Calvin cycle. We show in the present study that spinach leaf extracts display a substantial ribulosamine kinase activity (approx. 700 times higher than the specific activity of FN3K in erythrocytes). The ribulosamine kinase was purified approx. 400 times and shown to phosphorylate ribulose-epsilon-lysine, protein-bound ribulosamines and also, with higher affinity, erythrulose-epsilon-lysine and protein-bound erythrulosamines. Evidence is presented for the fact that the third carbon of the sugar portion is phosphorylated by this enzyme and that this leads to the formation of unstable compounds decomposing with half-lives of approx. 30 min at 37 degrees C (ribulosamine 3-phosphates) and 5 min at 30 degrees C (erythrulosamine 3-phosphates). This decomposition results in the formation of a 2-oxo-3-deoxyaldose and inorganic phosphate, with regeneration of the free amino group. The Arabidopsis thaliana homologue of FN3K/FN3K-RP was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and shown to have properties similar to those of the enzyme purified from spinach leaves. These results indicate that the plant FN3K/FN3K-RP homologue, which appears to be targeted to the chloroplast in many species, is a ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinase. This enzyme may participate in a protein deglycation process removing Amadori products derived from ribose 5-phosphate and erythrose 4-phosphate, two Calvin cycle intermediates that are potent glycating agents.
CYP1A1 and 1A2, two important P450 isoforms in the brain that metabolize many endogenous and exogenous substrates, are downregulated during central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. The stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors has been demonstrated to be anti-inflammatory in many cell types, leading us to hypothesize that stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors could prevent the downregulation in CYP1A1 and 1A2 activity in an in vitro model of CNS inflammation. Isoproterenol, a general beta(1)/beta(2) receptor agonist, and clenbuterol, a specific beta(2) receptor agonist, were both able to prevent the LPS-induced downregulation in CYP1A1/2 activity in astrocytes. The involvement of beta-adrenergic receptors was confirmed using the general beta(1)/beta(2) receptor antagonist propranolol, which was able to abrogate the protection conferred by isoproterenol and clenbuterol in astrocytes treated with LPS. The isoproterenol and clenbuterol mediated protective effect on the LPS-induced downregulation in CYP1A activity was a cyclic AMP (cAMP) dependent process, since forskolin was able to mimic the protective effect. Isoproterenol and clenbuterol may also prevent the LPS-induced downregulation in CYP1A activity through changes in TNF alpha expression. Despite a slight reduction in the LPS-induced nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B, isoproterenol and clenbuterol had no effect on the DNA binding ability of this transcription factor, indicating that the beta-adrenergic protective effects on CYP1A activity occurred independent of changes in NF-kappa B activity. The results presented in this paper reveal that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation can modulate cytochrome P450 activity in an in vitro model of CNS inflammation by a cAMP mediated pathway.
CLC chloride channels are a family of channel proteins mediating chloride transport across the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes. The single yeast CLC protein Gef1p is localized to the Golgi and endosomal system. Investigating epitope-tagged variants of Gef1p, we found that the channel is proteolytically processed in the secretory pathway. Proteolytic cleavage occurs in the first extracellular loop of the protein at residues KR136/137 and is carried out by the Kex2p protease. Fragments mimicking the N- and C-terminal products of the cleavage reaction are non-functional when expressed alone. However, functional channels can assemble when the two fragments are co-expressed.
CYP7B1 is the enzyme responsible for hydroxylation and termination of the estrogenic actions of the androgen metabolite, 5alpha-androstane-3beta, 17beta-diol (3betaAdiol). 3betaAdiol is estrogenic in ERalpha or ERbeta positive cells only if they do not express CYP7B1. In this study we show that female CYP7B1(-/-) mice experience early onset of growth of the uterus and mammary glands and commence estrus cycles 2 days earlier than their wild-type littermates. Adult mammary glands and uteri appear to be under continuous estrogenic stimulation. We conclude that, by cell-specific regulation of the estrogenicity of 3betaAdiol, CYP7B1 performs two major tasks: (i) it allows 3betaAdiol to have growth inhibitory effects through ERbeta and (ii) it permits estradiol-specific activation of estrogen receptors by protection of certain cells from the estrogenic effects of 3betaAdiol. When CYP7B1 is inactivated, 3betaAdiol activates estrogen receptors indiscriminately, and the overall effect is prolonged and inappropriate exposure to estrogen.
PIK3CA belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) family, which play an important role in proliferation, adherence, transformation and cell survival through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Somatic activating mutations of this gene have recently been detected in several types of cancers. In the present study, 109 advanced ovarian carcinomas were analyzed for PIK3CA mutations in exon 9 and exon 20 by direct sequencing. Activating missense mutations were observed in 4 of the 109 tumors in addition to one variant leading no change of the PIK3CA protein. Two of the cases with mutations were mucinous and clear cell tumors, suggesting that PIK3CA mutations are more common in these rare histological types.
ABO incompatibility is a common haematological problem affecting the newborn. The haemolysis is widely accepted to follow a relatively benign course rarely causing the escalating levels of hyperbilirubinaemia and significant anaemia associated with Rh haemolytic disease of the newborn. Case reports of fetal hydrops secondary to ABO incompatibility are particularly rare. We describe two cases, first that of a twin pregnancy with both fetuses developing severe anaemia at 20 weeks gestation, and then a second case of a preterm baby demonstrating aggressive haemolysis and anaemia within hours of delivery. Both mothers were of black Africian origin and both were identified to have elevated titres of IgG anti-B antibodies.
GPI 15715 is the first water-soluble propofol prodrug that has been studied in humans. Present propofol lipid formulations have well known undesirable properties, for example, pain on injection and increased triglyceride concentrations. We investigated whether GPI 15715 is suitable to achieve and maintain moderate sedation for 2 h. Six male and six female volunteers received a target-controlled infusion of GPI 15715, with an initial propofol target concentration of 1.8 microg/mL and the possibility to adjust the propofol target once after 1 h. Propofol concentrations, the bispectral index, and modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (MOAA/S) scores were monitored. The median MOAA/S score was 4 during the first hour and was 3 during the second hour of infusion. The propofol target had to be changed to 2.4 microg/mL in seven volunteers and to 3.0 microg/mL in two volunteers. A propofol concentration of 1.9 microg/mL had the highest probability to result in an MOAA/S score of 3, which corresponds with moderate sedation. We observed no serious side effects. We conclude that GPI 15715 produces excellent sedation.
ABO histo-blood group antigens have been postulated to modify pathogen spread through the action of natural antibodies and complement. The antigens are generated by a polymorphic glycosyl-transferase encoded by 2 dominant active and a recessive inactive allele. In this study we investigated whether ABO sugars are incorporated into the envelope of HIV-1 virions. HIV vectors derived from cells expressing ABO antigens displayed sensitivity to fresh human serum analogous to ABO incompatibility, and ABO histo-blood group sugars were detected on the viral envelope protein, glycoprotein 120 (gp120). Moreover, lymphocyte-derived virus also displayed serum sensitivity, reflecting the ABO phenotype of the host when cultured in autologous serum due to adsorption of antigens to cell surfaces. Serum sensitivity required both active complement and specific anti-ABO antibodies. Thus, incorporation of ABO antigens by HIV-1 may affect transmission of virus between individuals of discordant blood groups by interaction with host natural antibody and complement.
ABO genotyping for forensic identification by oligonucleotide chip.
CYP1A2 regulation by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exposure and polymorphism was investigated in 46 male volunteers from the Carboniferous Region in northern Coahuila, Mexico. PAH exposure was estimated by the urinary excretion of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP), whereas the regulatory effects were assessed by the caffeine metabolic ratio (CMR). Genotype was evaluated by determining 5'-flanking region (-2964) and intron I (734) polymorphisms. A statistically significant difference in the urinary 1-OHP geometric means of Barroterán, Cloete and Juárez (2.30, 0.45 and 0.04, respectively) was observed. As for the genotype, the intron I distribution was 0% C/C, 46% C/A and 54% A/A, whereas that of the 5'-flanking region was 26% G/G, 42% G/A and 32% A/A. Both distributions were in agreement with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium model. A greater enzyme activity was observed in the A/A compared to C/A individuals according to the CMR (P<0.001), whereas the 5'-flanking region polymorphism showed no effect on CYP1A2 enzymatic activity. These results suggest that intron I polymorphism and PAH exposure are relevant factors that modulate CYP1A2 enzymatic activity.
CYP2C9 is an important member of the cytochrome P450 enzyme superfamily with some 12 CYP2C9 alleles (*1-*12) being previously reported. Recently, we identified a new CYP2C9 allele with a Leu90Pro mutation in a Chinese poor metabolizer of lornoxicam [Si D, Guo Y, Zhang Y, Yang L, Zhou H, and Zhong D (2004) Pharmacogenetics 14:465-469]. The new allele, designated CYP2C9*13, was found to occur in approximately 2% of the Chinese population. To examine enzymatic activity of the CYP2C9*13 allele, kinetic parameters for lornoxicam 5'-hydroxylation were determined in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 plasmids carrying wild-type CYP2C9*1, variant CYP2C9*3, and CYP2C9*13 cDNA. The protein levels of cDNA-expressed CYP2C9*3 and *13 in postmitochondrial supernatant (S9) from transfected cells were lower than those from wild-type CYP2C9*1. Mean values of Km and Vmax for CYP2C9*1, *3, and *13 were 1.24, 1.61, and 2.79 microM and 0.83, 0.28, and 0.22 pmol/min/pmol, respectively. Intrinsic clearance values (Vmax/Km) for variant CYP2C9*3 and CYP2C9*13 on the basis of CYP2C9 protein levels were separately decreased to 28% and 12% compared with wild type. In a subsequent clinical study, the AUC of lornoxicam was increased by 1.9-fold and its oral clearance (CL/F) decreased by 44% in three CYP2C9*1/*13 subjects, compared with CYP2C9*1/*1 individuals. This suggests that the CYP2C9*13 allele is associated with decreased enzymatic activity both in vitro and in vivo.
CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein found in myriad mammalian tissues and cell types. It is known for its involvement in the metabolism of cyclic ADP-ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate, two nucleotides with calcium mobilizing activity independent of inositol trisphosphate. CD38 itself has been shown to have clinical significance in certain diseases with possible utilization in diagnostic and prognostic applications. Previous studies on several autoimmune diseases have shown the usefulness of recombinant CD38 protein expressed from Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris in the detection of autoantibodies to CD38 via Western blot and ELISA. In this study, we produced a 6 x His-tagged GST-CD38 fusion protein using a recombinant baculovirus/insect cell expression technique that was purified as a soluble protein. The fusion protein was purified to homogeneity by affinity and gel filtration chromatography steps. It has an apparent molecular mass of 56 kDa on SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie blue and was recognized on Western blots by antibodies against human CD38 as well as the polyhistidine tag. Peptide mass fingerprinting analysis confirmed the identity of human CD38 in the fusion protein.
CD36 is a receptor, whose expression increases during the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages, playing a key role in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and in the formation of foam cells during atherosclerosis. Recently, it has been described that ligands of PPARgamma induce CD36 expression and inhibit cyclooxygenase expression in macrophages. Our aim was to study whether the reduction of endogenous prostaglandin production could modify CD36 expression in macrophages and to outline the potential mechanism.
CFTR protein (cystic fibrosis trans membrane conductance regulator) is expressed in multiple epithelial tissues, including upper and lower respiratory tracts, pancreas, sweat glands and gastrointestinal tract. More than 800 mutations and 100 polymorphic variants of DNA sequences were identified in patients with CF (Cystic fibrosis) and CFTR-diseases. In this study, genetic CFTR analysis of the children suffering from chronic lung disease (cystic fibrosis) is presented. They are treated and regularly controlled at the Pediatric hospital Sarajevo. CFTR analysis was done in 9 cases, 4 boys (44.4%) and 5 girls (55.55%). There are 3 children (33.3%) in the age group 1 to 3 years, 1 child (11.1%) in the age group 3 to 6 years, 3 children (33.3%) in the age group 6 to 9 years and 2 children (22.2%) in the age group 9 to 12 years. Genetic analysis was conducted at the Medical center for molecular biology, School of Medicine, Ljubljana. PCR method with PAGE and direct sequestration on ABI PRISM 31 was applied. The majority of children (7 children, i.e. 77.77%) had CFTR mutation Delta F 508 whilst one child had G542X mutation and one child R 1174 mutation. The purpose of this study is to emphasize the need for CFTR gene identification in the institutes of our country.
CD38 has been widely characterized both as an ecto-enzyme and as a receptor. As an enzyme, CD38 catalyzes the conversion of NAD(+) and NADP to several metabolites including cADPR and NAADP, which mediate Ca(2+) release from separate intracellular stores, and ADPR, which activates the TRPM2 plasma membrane Ca(2+) channel. Since the catalytic domain of CD38 is exposed to the extracellular milieu, several mechanistic and topological studies have been performed to explain how CD38 gains access to its substrates, which are found at highest concentration in the cytosol of cells, and how the non-permeant metabolites produced by ecto-CD38 arrive at their intracellular site(s) of action. Accordingly, several studies have reported that CD38 is not only expressed on the plasma membrane but is also found in various sub-cellular compartments, including the nucleus where it is localized to the inner nuclear membrane. In this work, we employed a protocol of mild membrane solubilization to cleanly separate plasma membranes from other intracellular membranes and then analyzed the sub-cellular expression of murine CD38 in purified primary B lymphocytes. After immunoprecipitation, CD38 was exclusively detected in the plasma membrane protein containing soluble fraction and not in the insoluble fraction which was highly enriched for nuclear, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial proteins. Likewise, NAD(+) glycohydrolase measurements and confocal microscopy analysis corroborated that CD38 was not localized in nuclear membranes and indicated that CD38 is primarily, if not exclusively, localized to the plasma membrane of murine B lymphocytes.
AQP5 and AQP8 possess targeting/retention motifs which mediate their localization to the apical and basolateral membranes, respectively, of polarized MDCK-II cells. As targeting/retention motifs have been localized to the N- or C-termini of other AQPs, we sought the location of such motifs in AQPs 5 and 8 by exchanging their corresponding N- or C-termini and examining the expression, localization, and function of the resultant chimeras. We did not detect the expression of constructs in which the C-terminus of AQP5 was replaced by the C-terminus of AQP8. Substitution of the N-terminus of AQP8 for the N-terminus of AQP5 generated a construct which was trapped intracellularly and did not significantly facilitate transepithelial fluid movement. In contrast, modifications of the N- and C-termini of AQP8 were better tolerated. Substitution of either AQP8 terminus by the corresponding AQP5 terminus generated constructs which localized to basolateral membranes and facilitated transepithelial fluid movement. Our results suggest that, unlike the other AQP targeting/retention signals reported thus far, an AQP8 basolateral targeting/retention motif might reside between the two cytosolic termini.
CD36 is a multiligand receptor associated with a broad array of physiological processes and involved in markedly diverse disorders, including atherosclerosis, insulin resistance and diabetes, dyslipidemia, tumor angiogenesis, and host defense against Plasmodium falciparum. CD36 deficiency has proved to be common, particularly in ethnic groups such as African Americans and Asians. CD36 is commonly expressed on blasts in acute monocytic leukemia, megakaryoblastic leukemia, and erythroleukemia. The role of CD36 in sickle cell crises and cerebral malaria is debatable. As a receptor for thrombospondin 1, CD36 plays a role in the regulation of angiogenesis, which may be a therapeutic strategy for controlling the dissemination of malignant neoplasms. The future challenge will be to further understand the mechanisms by which CD36 affects these diverse functions and to design therapeutic strategies that can alter the course of the diseases.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates both protein and phosphoinositide substrates. It is mutated in a variety of human tumours and has important roles in a diverse range of biological processes, including cell migration and chemotaxis. PTEN's intracellular localization and presumably activity are regulated by chemoattractants in Dictyostelium and mouse neutrophils. However, the mechanisms for its regulation remain elusive. Here we show that RhoA and Cdc42, members of the Rho family of small GTPases, regulate the intracellular localization of PTEN in leukocytes and human transfected embryonic kidney cells. In addition, active RhoA is able to stimulate the phospholipid phosphatase activity of PTEN in human embryonic kidney cells and leukocytes, and this regulation seems to require RhoA's downstream effector, RhoA-associated kinase (Rock). Furthermore, we have identified key residues on PTEN that are required for its regulation by the small GTPase, and show that small GTPase-mediated regulation of PTEN has a significant role in the regulation of chemotaxis.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently mutated or deleted in a variety of human cancers including human gastric cancer. PTEN functions primarily as a lipid phosphatase and plays a key role in the regulation of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway, thereby modulating cell proliferation and cell survival. On the other hand, the IGF system plays an important role in cell proliferation and cell survival via the PI3 kinase/Akt and MAP kinase pathways in many cancer cells. To characterize the impact of PTEN on the IGF-IGFR-IGFBP axis in gastric cancer, we overexpressed PTEN using an adenovirus gene transfer system in human gastric adenocarcinoma cells, SNU-484 and SNU-663, which lack PTEN. Overexpression of PTEN inhibited serum-induced as well as IGF-I-induced cell proliferation as compared to control cells. PTEN overexpression resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of IGF-I, -II, and IGF-IR. Interestingly, amongst the six IGFBPs, only IGFBP-3 was upregulated by PTEN, whereas IGFBP-4 and -6 were reduced. The IGFBP-3 promoter activity assay and Western immunoblotting demonstrate that PTEN regulates IGFBP-3 at the transcriptional level. In addition, the PI3 kinase inhibitor, LY294002, upregulates IGFBP-3 expression but downregulates IGF-I and IGF-II, indicating that PTEN controls IGFBP-3 and IGFs by an Akt-dependent pathway. These findings suggest that PTEN may inhibit antiapoptotic IGF actions not only by blocking the IGF-IGFR-induced Akt activity, but also by regulating expression of components of the IGF system, in particular, upregulation of IGFBP-3, which is known to exert antiproliferative effects through IGF-dependent and IGF-independent mechanisms in cancer cells.
ABO blood group antigens are only expressed by the epithelial cells of normal human corneas. Since AB0 blood group antigens are also known to be expressed on stromal and endothelial cells of inflamed corneas, this study aimed to investigate the extend of ABO blood group antigen expression in corneal allograft failures.
ABCG2 is a drug transporter involved in the protection of tissues by actively transporting toxic substances and xenobiotics out of cells. Cancer cells overexpressing the ABCG2 gene show multidrug resistance to mitoxantrone-, methotrexate-, doxorubicin-, and camptothecin-based anticancer drugs, such as topotecan and SN-38. Large interindividual differences have been shown in oral availability and clearance of drugs that are substrates for ABCG2. Variation in the ABCG2 gene, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), can possibly explain the variability in pharmacokinetics of ABCG2 substrates.
CLC proteins are a large structurally defined family of Cl- ion channels and H+/Cl- antiporters with nine distinct genes in mammals. The membrane-embedded part of CLC proteins bears no obvious similarity to any other class of membrane proteins, while the cytoplasmic C-terminus of most eukaryotic and some prokaryotic CLCs contains two regions with homology to cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) domains that are found in other proteins as well. Different members serve a broad range of physiological roles, including stabilization of the membrane potential, transepithelial ion transport, and vesicular acidification. Their physiological importance is underscored by the causative involvement in at least four different human genetic diseases. From functional studies of the Torpedo homologue ClC-0, a homodimeric architecture with two physically separate ion conduction pathways was anticipated and fully confirmed by solving the crystal structure of prokaryotic CLC homologues. The structure revealed a complex fold of 18 alpha-helices per subunit with at least two Cl- ions bound in the center of each protopore. A critical glutamic acid residue was identified whose side-chain seems to occupy a third Cl- ion binding site in the closed state and that moves away to allow Cl- binding. While the overall architecture and pore structure is certainly conserved from bacteria to humans, the bacterial proteins that were crystallized are actually not Cl- ion channels, but coupled H+/Cl- antiporters. These recent breakthroughs will allow us to study in further detail the structure, function, and the physiological and pathophysiological role of CLC proteins.
CYP2C9 is a major cytochrome P450 enzyme that is involved in the metabolic clearance of a wide variety of therapeutic agents, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatories, oral anticoagulants, and oral hypoglycemics. Disruption of CYP2C9 activity by metabolic inhibition or pharmacogenetic variability underlies many of the adverse drug reactions that are associated with the enzyme. CYP2C9 is also the first human P450 to be crystallized, and the structural basis for its substrate and inhibitor selectivity is becoming increasingly clear. New, ultrapotent inhibitors of CYP2C9 have been synthesised that aid in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to facilitate drug redesign, and extensive resequencing of the gene and studies of its regulation will undoubtedly help us understand interindividual variability in drug response and toxicity controlled by this enzyme.
ACE chimeric proteins and N domain monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were used to determine the influence of the N domain, and particular regions thereof, on the rate of ACE ectodomain shedding. Somatic ACE (having both N and C domains) was shed at a rate of 20%/24 h. Deletion of the C domain of somatic ACE generated an N domain construct (ACEDeltaC) which demonstrated the lowest rate of shedding (12%). However, deletion of the N domain of somatic ACE (ACEDeltaN) dramatically increased shedding (212%). Testicular ACE (tACE) having 36 amino acid residues (heavily O-glycosylated) at the N-terminus of the C domain shows a 4-fold decrease in the rate of shedding (49%) compared to that of ACEDeltaN. When the N-terminal region of the C domain was replaced with the corresponding homologous 141 amino acids of the N domain (N-delACE) the rate of shedding of the ACEDeltaN was only slightly decreased (174%), but shedding was still 3.5-fold more efficient than wild-type testicular ACE. Monoclonal antibodies specific for distinct, but overlapping, N-domain epitopes altered the rate of ACE shedding. The mAb 3G8 decreased the rate of shedding by 30%, whereas mAbs 9B9 and 3A5 stimulated ACE shedding 2- to 4-fold. Epitope mapping of these mAbs in conjunction with a homology model of ACE N domain structure, localized a region in the N-domain that may play a role in determining the relatively low rate of shedding of somatic ACE from the cell surface.
PNMT (phenylethanolamine-N-methyl-transferase) is the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of epinephrine from norepinephrine. In transgenic mice over-expressing PNMT, observations revealed a very high level of aggression compared to their background strain, C57BL/6J. To evaluate the influence of PNMT on aggression and emotionality in this transgenic line, single-sex male and female groups were independently established that consisted of either four wild-type mice or four transgenic mice overexpressing PNMT. The members of each group were littermates. Mixed single-sex groups consisting of two transgenic mice and two wild-type mice were also established. Almost no fights were observed within the female groups. In males, the transgenic line showed a significantly higher level of fighting than controls (p=0.007) and mixed male groups (p=0.02). Housing mice from the transgenic line in mixed groups with wild-type mice seems to decrease the level of aggression in the transgenic line. In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate a clear, significant increase in aggression arising from PNMT overexpression. This suggests an important role for central epinephrine levels in aggressive behavior.
PGD is an alternative to prenatal diagnosis that circumvents therapeutic abortion. Diagnosis is carried out on single cells obtained from three-day-old embryos, and only those that are free of the disease under consideration are transferred to the mother. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common neurocutaneous disorder, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. For some patients, PGD may be the only acceptable manner to ensure the birth of unaffected children. Because of the large number of known NF1 mutations, the development of mutation-specific single-cell protocols is impractical, labour-intensive and expensive. This paper discusses the development of five PGD protocols, three of which are based on multiplex PCR for microsatellite-markers linked to the NF1 gene. After a linkage study, the diagnosis can be established through the markers, thereby obviating the need to detect the mutation itself. This not only ensures the accurate diagnosis of the embryos, but also a prompt acceptance of PGD referrals since one protocol can be useful for several couples. In addition, two mutation-specific PCRs were developed for two couples where a marker-based protocol was not applicable. In total, 16 PGD cycles were carried out for six couples, which resulted in one ongoing pregnancy and the delivery of a healthy unaffected boy.
CD36 mediates the transfer of fatty acids (FAs) across the plasma membranes of muscle and adipose cells, thus playing an important role in regulating peripheral FA metabolism in vivo. In the proximal intestine, CD36 is localized in abundant quantities on the apical surface of epithelial cells, a pattern similar to that of other proteins implicated in the uptake of dietary FAs. To define the role of CD36 in the intestine, we examined FA utilization and lipoprotein secretion by WT and CD36-null mice in response to acute and chronic fat feeding. CD36-null mice given a fat bolus by gavage or fed a high-fat diet accumulated neutral lipid in the proximal intestine, which indicated abnormal lipid processing. Using a model in which mice were equipped with lymph fistulae, we obtained evidence of defective lipoprotein secretion by directly measuring lipid output. The secretion defect appeared to reflect an impaired ability of CD36-null enterocytes to efficiently synthesize triacylglycerols from dietary FAs in the endoplasmic reticulum. In the plasma of intact mice, the reduced intestinal lipid secretion was masked by slow clearance of intestine-derived lipoproteins. The impaired clearance occurred despite normal lipoprotein lipase activity and likely reflected feedback inhibition of the lipase by FAs due to their defective removal from the plasma. We conclude that CD36 is important for both secretion and clearance of intestinal lipoproteins. CD36 deficiency results in hypertriglyceridemia both in the postprandial and fasting states and in humans may constitute a risk factor for diet-induced type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
PRDX6 is a cytosolic member of the peroxiredoxin family of antioxidant proteins, which protect cells from oxidative damage by reducing cellular peroxides. Knockout studies and transgenic overexpression of Prdx6 in mice have demonstrated an important role for this protein in the defense against oxidative stress. Using Northern blotting with various Prdx6 probes, we have revealed the existence of multiple transcripts with distinct tissue distributions and regulation, including the major 1.4-kb transcript highly expressed in liver and lung, and two additional transcripts expressed primarily in liver. We hypothesized that these additional transcripts correspond either to alternative Prdx6 mRNAs or to highly related genes such as the intronless genes Aop2-rs1 and Aop2-rs2. A combination of Northern blotting, RACE, and EST and genomic sequence analysis has determined that all three liver transcripts are derived from the Prdx6 gene, as they are absent in Prdx6-null mice and differ in their 3' UTRs, suggesting the utilization of different transcription termination signal sequences which we have identified by sequence analysis. We found the Aop2-rs1 gene to be exclusively expressed in testis as a 1.2-kb transcript and have identified putative regulatory elements in its promoter. In contrast, Aop2-rs2 appears not to be expressed in any tissues, although we have evidence for the existence of other related genes that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Since the Prdx6 transcripts exhibit differential regulation in response to growth and oxidative stress, further investigation may reveal their distinct roles in the cell and mechanism of regulation.
ABO incompatible kidney transplantation (ABOINCKT) has been developed in Japan because of the shortage of cadaveric donors. We have performed 76 living-donor ABOINCKT in our center. Donor blood type antibody was removed by immunoadsorption or plasmapheresis and exchange. Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine or tacrolimus, steroid, and cyclophosphamide or azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil and, recently, basiliximab. Splenectomy was routinely performed during the transplantation surgery. Donor blood type antigen was strongly expressed on the vascular endothelium at all time points and in all conditions posttransplantation. Red blood cell agglutination reaction (RBAR) was positive only in renal tissues from a patient with delayed hyperacute rejection. Donor specific antibody suppression was observed in 18 ABOINCKT recipients with blood type O from a donor with blood type A1 or B. ADCC activity was detected after pre-treatment. Acute humoral rejection in ABOINCKT can result from ADCC, as well as by antigen-antibody reaction. Five year graft and patient survival rates were 75% and 64% in 37 ABOINCKT recipients from June 1989 through December 1996, however they have been 100% in 39 ABOINCKT recipients since January 1997. Accommodation has been produced in ABOINCKT with the co-existence of blood type antigen and antibody. Currently, ABOINCKT is an alternative which should be considered, particularly for blood type O patients with extended waits for cadaveric transplantation and for pediatric patients.
CYP2J2 plays important roles in the metabolism of therapeutic drugs, such as astemizole and ebastine, as well as endogenous fatty acids. This study aimed to identify CYP2J2 genetic variants in Koreans and to characterize their functional consequences. From direct sequencing of the CYP2J2 gene, 12 genetic variations, including the two novel nonsynonymous mutations G312R and P351L, were identified from 93 Korean subjects. The two novel CYP2J2 variants were co-expressed with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in Sf9 cells and their catalytic activities were quantified. The recombinant CYP2J2 G312R variant showed almost complete loss of enzymatic activity, as determined by CYP2J2-catalysed astemizole O-demethylation and ebastine hydroxylation. The CYP2J2 P351L variant showed enzymatic activities that were comparable with the wild-type CYP2J2. The reduced CO spectra of the recombinant CYP2J2 proteins suggested no CO binding to the heme in CYP2J2 G312R. In addition, molecular modelling of the three-dimensional structure consistently predicted that there might be spatial hindrance between heme and the bulky side chain of the R312 residue in CYP2J2 G312R variant. The CYP2J2 G312R variant was not found in 192 Chinese, 99 African-Americans, 100 Caucasians and 159 Vietnamese subjects. Two of the 192 Chinese subjects (0.52%) were heterozygous for CYP2J2 P351L. Twelve CYP2J2 variants, including two novel nonsynonymous variants, were identified in a Korean population. The G312R variant is the first nonfunctional CYP2J2 allele to be identified, and is expected to influence the disposition of its substrate therapeutics, as well as endogenous compounds.
CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 metabolize arachidonic acid (AA) to cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which play a central role in regulating renal tubular fluid-electrolyte transport and vascular tone. We hypothesized that functionally relevant polymorphisms in the CYP2J2 or CYP2C8 genes influence hypertension risk. We examined associations between CYP2J2*7 (G-50 T promoter) and CYP2C8*3 (Arg139Lys and Lys399Arg, which are in 100% linkage disequilibrium) polymorphisms and hypertension in a biethnic population from Tennessee. CYP2J2*7 variant allele frequency was significantly higher in African-Americans versus Caucasians (14.1% versus 7.7%, P=0.01), irrespective of hypertension status. When analysed separately by race, the genotype distribution of the CYP2J2*7 variant allele was not significantly different among African-Americans with/without hypertension, but was significantly different among Caucasians with/without hypertension (P=0.03). Indeed, the odds ratio of having hypertension attributable to carrying the CYP2J2*7 variant allele adjusted for age, gender, body mass index and family history was 0.39 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.89) among Caucasians, suggesting a protective effect. Additional subgroup analyses revealed a significantly lower CYP2J2*7 variant allele frequency in hypertensive versus normotensive Caucasian males (5.6% versus 12.5%, P=0.02) and in hypertensive versus normotensive Caucasians without a family history of hypertension (1.5% versus 11.0%, P=0.03). With respect to the CYP2C8*3 variant, genotype distribution and allele frequencies were similar between normotensive and hypertensive subjects. This study provides evidence for an association between CYP2J2*7 genotype and hypertension in Caucasian males and Caucasians without a family history of hypertension, but suggests no association between CYP2C8*3 genotype and hypertension. Confirmation of these findings in additional populations is warranted.
WWOX is a candidate tumour suppressor gene that exhibits LOH or homozygous deletion in several tumour types. As well as the predominant full-length transcript (variant 1) there also exist alternatively spliced transcripts found previously only in malignant tissue. It has been suggested that proteins encoded by these variants may interfere with normal WWOX function in a dominant negative fashion. The most prevalent alternate transcript demonstrated in ovarian cancer is variant 4, which lacks exons 6-8. Here, we report the first comparison of the mRNA expression of WWOX variants 1 and 4 in human ovarian tumours and normal ovaries, and correlate expression with clinical data. We demonstrate significantly lower WWOX variant 1 expression in tumours than in normal ovaries. This reduction was not associated with any specific clinical subgroup. Variant 4 was expressed at low levels, and significantly associated with high grade and advanced stage ovarian cancer. Furthermore, tumours co-expressing variant 4 and relatively high levels of variant 1 showed significantly worse survival than tumours expressing variant 1 alone. However, variant 4 was also frequently identified in non-malignant ovarian tissue. These results support the role of WWOX variant 1 as a suppressor of ovarian tumourigenesis, but the role of variant 4 remains speculative.
CYP2S1 is a recently discovered dioxin-inducible member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. It has been shown to be involved in the metabolism of some aromatic hydrocarbons as well as retinoic acid, suggesting a role in biotransformation of both exogenous and endogenous compounds. In this study, we used mRNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to investigate the cellular localization of CYP2S1 in various human tissues using tissue microarrays. High expression levels were observed mainly in epithelial cell types, especially in the epithelia frequently exposed to xenobiotics. In the respiratory tract, the expression was strong in nasal cavity, bronchi, and bronchioli, whereas it was low in the alveolar lining cells. Similarly, CYP2S1 was highly expressed in the epithelial cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Strong epithelial expression was also observed in uterine cervix, urinary bladder, and skin. In many exocrine glands (e.g., adrenal gland and pancreas), secretory epithelial cells showed moderate to strong expression levels. In the liver, the expression was low. CYP2S1 was highly expressed in epithelial cells that are major targets for carcinogen exposure and common progenitor cells to tumor development. Indeed, we found strong CYP2S1 expression in many tumors of epithelial origin.
NQO1 is a reductive enzyme that is important for the activation of many bioreductive agents and is a target for an enzyme-directed approach to cancer therapy. It can be selectively induced in many tumor types by a number of compounds including dimethyl fumarate and sulforaphane. Mitomycin C is a bioreductive agent that is used clinically for treatment of solid tumors. RH1 (2,5-diaziridinyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)- 6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone) is a new bioreductive agent currently in clinical trials. We have shown previously that induction of NQO1 can enhance the antitumor activity of mitomycin C in tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. As RH1 is activated selectively by NQO1 while mitomycin C is activated by many reductive enzymes, we investigated whether induction of NQO1 would produce a greater enhancement of the antitumor activity of RH1 compared with mitomycin C. HCT116 human colon cancer cells and T47D human breast cancer cells were incubated with or without dimethyl fumarate or sulforaphane followed by mitomycin C or RH1 treatment, and cytotoxic activity was measured by a clonogenic (HCT116) or MTT assay (T47D). Dimethyl fumarate and sulforaphane treatment increased NQO1 activity by 1.4- to 2.8-fold and resulted in a significant enhancement of the antitumor activity of mitomycin C, but not of RH1. This appeared to be due to the presence of a sufficient constitutive level of NQO1 activity in the tumor cells to fully activate the RH1. Mice were implanted with HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, which have low levels of NQO1 activity. The mice were fed control or dimethyl fumarate-containing diet and were treated with RH1. NQO1 activity in the tumors increased but RH1 produced no antitumor activity in mice fed control or dimethyl fumarate diet. This is consistent with a narrow window of NQO1 activity between no RH1 activation and maximum RH1 activation. This study suggests that selective induction of NQO1 in tumor cells is not likely to be an effective strategy for enhancing the antitumor activity of RH1. In addition, we found that RH1 treatment produced significant leukopenia in mice that may be of concern in the clinic. These results suggest that the ease of reduction of RH1 by NQO1 makes it a poor candidate for an enzyme-directed approach to cancer therapy.
PGD is a well accepted reproductive choice for couples at genetic risk and involves the diagnosis and transfer of unaffected IVF embryos. PGD for monogenetic diseases is most commonly accomplished by the biopsy of one or two blastomeres from cleavage stage embryos, followed by PCR-based protocols. However, PCR-based DNA analysis of one or two cells is subject to several problems, including total PCR failure, or failure of one allele to amplify. Trophectoderm biopsy at the blastocyst stage enables the removal of more than two cells for diagnosis while being non-invasive to the inner cell mass which is destined for fetal development. The aim of this study was to develop a safe, reliable technique for the biopsy of trophectoderm cells from human blastocysts. This case report demonstrates that removal of trophectoderm cells prior to blastocyst transfer is compatible with implantation and development to term. Here we report successful PGD for beta-thalassaemia following trophectoderm cell biopsy from blastocysts and the birth of a healthy infant.
CFTR mutations cause defects of CFTR protein production and function by different molecular mechanisms. Mutations can be classified according to the mechanisms by which they disrupt CFTR function. This understanding of the different molecular mechanisms of CFTR dysfunction provides the scientific basis for the development of targeted drugs for mutation-specific therapy of cystic fibrosis (CF). Class I mutations are nonsense mutations that result in the presence of a premature stop codon that leads to the production of unstable mRNA, or the release from the ribosome of a short, truncated protein that is not functional. Aminoglycoside antibiotics can suppress premature termination codons by disrupting translational fidelity and allowing the incorporation of an amino acid, thus permitting translation to continue to the normal termination of the transcript. Class II mutations cause impairment of CFTR processing and folding in the Golgi. As a result, the mutant CFTR is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and eventually targeted for degradation by the quality control mechanisms. Chemical and molecular chaperones such as sodium-4-phenylbutyrate can stabilize protein structure, and allow it to escape from degradation in the ER and be transported to the cell membrane. Class III mutations disrupt the function of the regulatory domain. CFTR is resistant to phosphorylation or adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) binding. CFTR activators such as alkylxanthines (CPX) and the flavonoid genistein can overcome affected ATP binding through direct binding to a nucleotide binding fold. In patients carrying class IV mutations, phosphorylation of CFTR results in reduced chloride transport. Increases in the overall cell surface content of these mutants might overcome the relative reduction in conductance. Alternatively, restoring native chloride pore characteristics pharmacologically might be effective. Activators of CFTR at the plasma membrane may function by promoting CFTR phosphorylation, by blocking CFTR dephosphorylation, by interacting directly with CFTR, and/or by modulation of CFTR protein-protein interactions. Class V mutations affect the splicing machinery and generate both aberrantly and correctly spliced transcripts, the levels of which vary among different patients and among different organs of the same patient. Splicing factors that promote exon inclusion or factors that promote exon skipping can promote increases of correctly spliced transcripts, depending on the molecular defect. Inconsistent results were reported regarding the required level of corrected or mutated CFTR that had to be reached in order to achieve normal function.
ABO blood group is an important determinant of plasma von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) levels, with lower levels in group O. Previous reports have suggested that ABO(H) sugars affect the susceptibility of VWF to ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type-1 repeats-13) cleavage. To further test this hypothesis, we collected plasma from individuals with the rare Bombay blood group. VWF:Ag levels were significantly lower in Bombay patients (median, 0.69 IU/mL) than in groups AB, A, or B (P < .05) and lower than in group O individuals (median, 0.82 IU/mL). Susceptibility of purified VWF fractions to recombinant ADAMTS13 cleavage, assessed using VWF collagen-binding assay (VWF:CB), was increased in Bombays compared with either group O or AB. Increasing urea concentration (0.5 to 2 M) increased the cleavage rate for each blood group but eliminated the differences between groups. We conclude that reduction in the number of terminal sugars on N-linked glycan increases susceptibility of globular VWF to ADAMTS13 proteolysis and is associated with reduced plasma VWF:Ag and VWF:CB levels.
"PAH trials traditionally use 6MW as the primary endpoint. Concerns regarding a ""ceiling effect"" masking efficacy have led to exclusion of patients with milder disease from most trials (BL 6MW>450 m). STRIDE I evaluated the selective endothelin A receptor antagonist, sitaxsentan (SITAX), in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, trial (178 patients) employing placebo (PBO), 100 mg or 300 mg SITAX orally once daily in PAH and included patients with NYHA class II, congenital heart disease and a BL 6MW>450 m, groups often excluded from previous trials."
CAD is a multifunctional protein that initiates and regulates mammalian de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. The activation of the pathway required for cell proliferation is a consequence of the phosphorylation of CAD Thr-456 by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Although most of the CAD in the cell was cytosolic, cell fractionation and fluorescence microscopy showed that Thr(P)-456 CAD was primarily localized within the nucleus in association with insoluble nuclear substructures, including the nuclear matrix. CAD in resting cells was cytosolic and unphosphorylated. Upon epidermal growth factor stimulation, CAD moved to the nucleus, and Thr-456 was found to be phosphorylated. Mutation of the CAD Thr-456 and inhibitor studies showed that nuclear import is not mediated by MAP kinase phosphorylation. Two fluorescent CAD constructs, NLS-CAD and NES-CAD, were prepared that incorporated strong nuclear import and export signals, respectively. NLS-CAD was exclusively nuclear and extensively phosphorylated. In contrast, NES-CAD was confined to the cytoplasm, and Thr-456 remained unphosphorylated. Although alternative explanations can be envisioned, it is likely that phosphorylation occurs within the nucleus where much of the activated MAP kinase is localized. Trapping CAD in the nucleus had a minimal effect on pyrimidine metabolism. In contrast, when CAD was excluded from the nucleus, the rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis, the nucleotide pools, and the growth rate were reduced by 21, 36, and 60%, respectively. Thus, the nuclear import of CAD appears to promote optimal cell growth. UMP synthase, the bifunctional protein that catalyzes the last two steps in the pathway, was also found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus.
CYP3A4 plays an important role in the metabolism of a variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds. Earlier studies revealed that a high-activity variation of the CYP3A4 gene, CYP3A4*1B is significantly associated with the precocious puberty in girls. Other three variations, CYP3A4*4, CYP3A4*5 and CYP3A4*6, which were found in a study carried out in a Chinese population in Taiwan, were reported to down-regulate the enzymatic activity of CYP3A4. The four activity SNPs were typed in our study in two groups of Chinese girls: 176 girls with precocious puberty as the case group, and 192 normal girls as the control group. No variations of CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A4*4 were found in all the cases and controls. Heterozygous of CYP3A4*5 was found in five subjects of the 192 controls but none in the cases, heterozygous of CYP3A4*6 was found in two subjects of the controls but none in the cases. Fisher's exact test showed that the variation of CYP3A4*5 was associated with the onset of puberty in Chinese girls (P-trend=0.038), while the variation of CYP3A4*6 was not associated with the onset of puberty in Chinese girls (P-trend=0.272). The result suggests that these mutations in the CYP3A4 gene have no contribution to the early onset of puberty in Chinese girls, but are related in some way with the puberty development in Chinese girls.
AQP10 (aquaporin 10) is a new member of water channels and two different transcripts have been reported. The difference between these transcripts is in the presence or the absence of an insertion of 475 nt, which leads to a translation frame shift resulting in a different termination of amino acid translation and synthesis of a shorter form of AQP10. Thus an AQP10 molecule deduced from the transcript with an insertion has a distinct C-terminus, different from that translated from the transcript without the insertion. In the present study, we investigated the expression and localization of these AQP10 isoforms.
AQP3 (aquaporin 3) in the skin is important for skin moisture as demonstrated by the studies of AQP3-null mice, which have accelerated skin drying. Prevention of dry skin is important not only from a cosmetic but also from a clinical point of view. Primary keratinocyte cultures are cumbersome for screening substances that modulate AQP3 expression.
ABCA1 has been established to be required for the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoproteins such as apoA-I. At present, it is unclear whether ABCA1-mediated lipid exposure is specific with regard to lipid headgroups and whether it requires calcium activation and the presence of a lipid acceptor. In the present work, we found exofacial exposure of endogenous phosphatidylserine in the absence of apoA-I to be enhanced in ABCA1-GFP expressing MDCKII and HeLa cells compared with control cells. By using C6-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) (NBD)-labeled phospholipid analogues, we observed elevated redistribution of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine but not of phosphatidylcholine analogues from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane of ABCA1-GFP expressing cells. Whereas glyburide affected neither the level of exofacial endogenous PS nor the outward movement of the amino phospholipid analogues, the latter was sensitive to intracellular Ca2+ in ABCA1-GFP expressing cells, further enhancing outward analogue redistribution with respect to control cells. Both receptor-mediated endocytosis and fluidphase endocytosis were reduced in MDCKII cells expressing ABCA1-GFP. Glyburide raised the level of receptor-mediated endocytosis in the ABCA1-GFP expressing cell to the level of control cells in the absence of glyburide. In control cells, however, fluid-phase endocytosis but not receptor-mediated endocytosis was significantly reduced upon glyburide treatment.
PGD is becoming an alternative to prenatal diagnosis. The combination of IVF techniques with the PCR technology allows for the detection of genetic abnormalities in first polar bodies from oocytes and blastomeres from cleavage-stage embryos. Dealing with a genetic disease with a heterogeneous spectrum of mutations like cystic fibrosis, one of the objectives of centres offering PGD is the application of simple and efficient protocols that allow for the detection of a wide range of mutations with a single procedure. In the present work, 29 normal loci and the 31 most frequent cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations in Southern Europe could be detected at the same time in single cells applying a modified and improved primer extension preamplification-PCR. Two different Taq polymerases were tested in isolated buccal cells heterozygous for several mutations. The protocol that gave statistically significant better results was also successful in oocytes and their first polar bodies.
ABCG2 (BCRP/MXR/ABCP) functions as an efflux transporter for many agents, including topotecan, and the protein is expressed at high levels in the human intestine. Some individuals possess a nonsynonymous variant in the ABCG2 gene at nucleotide 421, substituting lysine for glutamine on position 141 at exon 5. The present pilot study indicates that this genotype results in a 30% reduced efflux transport of topotecan in vitro compared to the wild-type. In a preliminary fashion, the heterozygous CA allele observed in two patients was associated with a 1.34-fold increased oral bioavailability of topotecan compared to the bioavailability in ten patients with the wild-type allele (42.0% versus 31.4%; p = 0.037). It is suggested that the high frequency of the A allele in certain ethnic groups may have therapeutic implications for individuals treated with topotecan or other ABCG2 substrates.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that inhibits cell cycle progression. Recent data support that PTEN transcription is upregulated by Egr-1. The present study evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of PTEN and Egr-1 in normal thyroid and in its benign and malignant proliferative lesions. PTEN expression was cytoplasmic. The median percentage of normal cells with positive staining was 97.5%. It was similar in nodular hyperplasia, adenoma and papillary carcinoma. Follicular and undifferentiated carcinoma presented a significant decrease in the percentage of positive cells (P=0.027 and P=0.004). Egr-1 expression was nuclear. The median percentage of positivity was similar in normal tissue (29.75%), nodular hyperplasia (30.5%) and papillary carcinoma (28.25%). Adenomas, follicular carcinomas and undifferentiated carcinomas showed a significant decrease of nuclear positivity (P=0.001; P=0.001 and P=0.004, respectively).
CLC proteins are found in cells from prokaryotes to mammals and perform functions in plasma membranes and intracellular vesicles. Several genetic human diseases and mouse models underscore their broad physiological functions in mammals. These functions range from the control of excitability to transepithelial transport, endocytotic trafficking and acidification of synaptic vesicles. The recent crystallization of bacterial CLC proteins gave surprising insights into CLC Cl(-)-channel permeation and gating and provides an excellent basis for structure-function studies. Surprisingly, the CLC from Escherichia coli functions as a Cl-/H+ exchanger, thus demonstrating the thin line separating transporters and channels.
CYP2C9 is an important human drug-metabolizing enzyme that is expressed primarily in liver. Recent studies in our laboratory have shown that the nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR) is important in the transcriptional activation of the CYP2C9 promoter by drugs such as rifampicin and that the essential element is a constitutive androstane receptor (CAR)/PXR site -1839 bp upstream of the translation start site. Both CAR and PXR transcriptionally up-regulate the CYP2C9 promoter via these elements. In the present study, we ask whether additional sites in the proximal promoter also play a role in this induction. We identify two proximal hepatic nuclear factor (HNF) 4alpha binding sites at -152 and -185 bp of the CYP2C9 promoter, both of which bind HNF4alpha in gel shift assays and transcriptionally up-regulate this promoter in response to HNF4alpha in HepG2 cells. HNF4alpha synergizes with CAR and with PXR in HepG2 cells treated with rifampicin. The synergy only occurs when the CAR/PXR binding site at -1839 bp is present. Mutation of the two HNF4alpha binding sites differentially prevented up-regulation of CYP2C9 promoter by both CAR as well as HNF4alpha, synergy between the two receptors, and essentially abolished induction by rifampicin in HepG2 cells transfected with PXR. These studies strongly support the hypothesis that there is cross talk between distal CAR/PXR sites and HNF4alpha binding sites in the CYP2C9 promoter and that the HNF4alpha sites are required for maximal induction of the CYP2C9 promoter.
ACE inhibitors are widely used to antagonize the biological activity of angiotensin II in hypertensive heart disease. Oestrogen reduces angiotensin type 1 receptor expression, and thereby modifies angiotensin signalling.
PIK3CA is mutated in diverse human cancers, but the functional effects of these mutations have not been defined. To evaluate the consequences of PIK3CA alterations, the two most common mutations were inactivated by gene targeting in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Biochemical analyses of these cells showed that mutant PIK3CA selectively regulated the phosphorylation of AKT and the forkhead transcription factors FKHR and FKHRL1. PIK3CA mutations had little effect on growth under standard conditions, but reduced cellular dependence on growth factors. PIK3CA mutations resulted in attenuation of apoptosis and facilitated tumor invasion. Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abrogated PIK3CA signaling and preferentially inhibited growth of PIK3CA mutant cells. These data have important implications for therapy of cancers harboring PIK3CA alterations.
CFTR channels conduct HCO(3)(-) in addition to Cl(-) in airway epithelial cells. A defective HCO(3)(-)-transporting function of CFTR may underlie the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis. In the present study, we have investigated whether a HCO(3)(-)-sensitive soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) is functionally coupled with CFTR and thus forms an autoregulatory mechanism for HCO(3)(-) transport in human airway epithelial Calu-3 cells. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that transcripts of both full-length and truncated sACs are present in Calu-3 cells. Truncated sAC protein is the predominant, if not the only, isoform expressed in Calu-3 cells. HCO(3)(-) stimulated a modest increase in cAMP production, and the increase was sensitive to 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-HE), a sAC inhibitor, but not to SQ22,536, a blocker of conventional transmembrane adenylyl cyclases. These results suggest that sAC is functional in Calu-3 cells. Adding 25 mM HCO(3)(-) to the bath stimulated CFTR-mediated whole cell currents in the absence, but not in the presence, of 2-HE. In cell-attached membrane patches, 25 or 50 mM HCO(3)(-) in the bath markedly increased the product of channel number and open probability of CFTR, and this activation was attenuated by 2-HE. These findings demonstrate that sAC signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of CFTR function in human airway epithelium and thereby provides a link between the level of intracellular HCO(3)(-)/CO(2) and the modulation of HCO(3)(-)-conductive CFTR function by cAMP/PKA.
CYP2E1 is known to be induced in streptozotocin (STZ)-treated diabetic rats (STZ rats), and its induction is improved by insulin. We have examined the age-dependent changes of CYP2E1 in the liver microsomes of type 1 diabetic STZ rats, the effects of VOSO4 on the contents of total P450 and CYP2E1, and the activities of CYP2E1 in terms of p-nitrophenol hydroxylation. The contents of P450 and CYP2E1 and CYP2E1 activity were enhanced with the development of diabetes. When the hyperglycemia of STZ rats was improved by daily intraperitoneal injections of VOSO4 for 10 days at the doses of 7 mg/kg body weight for 5 days, 5 mg/kg for the following 3 days, and then 2.5 mg/kg for 2 days, the P450 and CYP2E1 levels and CYP2E1 activity were lowered than those in the untreated STZ rats. To understand the mechanism underlying CYP2E1-dependent hydroxylation activity, the production of reactive oxygen species was examined in the NADPH-liver microsomal systems by ESR spin-trapping. Singlet oxygen (1O2) was detected in all microsomal systems, while superoxide anion radical(*O2-) and hydroxyl radical (*OH) were not. On the basis of these results, we conclude that (1) CYP2E1 level and activity are enhanced in the diabetic state, however, they are improved by VOSO4 treatment, and (2) 1O2 is generated during CYP2E1-dependent substrate oxygenation.
PTEN (phosphatase with sequence homology to tensin) is a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatase that regulates many cellular processes. Activity of the enzyme is dependent on the redox state of the active site cysteine such that oxidation by H2O2 leads to inhibition. Because S-nitrosothiols are known to modify enzymes containing reactive cysteines, we hypothesized that S-nitrosothiols would oxidize PTEN and inhibit its phosphatase activity. In the present study, we show that S-nitrosocysteine (CSNO), S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) reversibly oxidized recombinant PTEN. In addition, CSNO led to concentration- and time-dependent oxidation of endogenous cellular PTEN. However, in contrast, GSNO and SNAP were effective only when coincubated with cysteine, suggesting that these nitrosothiols must react with cysteine to form CSNO, which can be transferred across cell membranes. Oxidation of cellular PTEN resulted from thiol modification and led to reversible inhibition of phosphatase activity. Although oxidation of PTEN by H2O2 led to formation of an intramolecular disulfide, oxidation of PTEN by CSNO seemed to lead to formation of a mixed disulfide. Glutathionylation of cellular proteins by incubating cells with diamide or incubating cellular extracts with GSSG oxidized PTEN in a manner similar to that of CSNO. Overall, these data demonstrate for the first time that S-nitrosothiols oxidatively modify PTEN, leading to reversible inhibition of its phosphatase activity, and suggest that the oxidized species is a mixed disulfide.
TAT (a cell penetrating peptide)-conjugated CdSratioMn/ZnS quantum dots (Qdots), intra-arterially delivered to a rat brain, rapidly (within a few minutes) labeled the brain tissue without manipulating the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Qdot loading was sufficiently high that it allowed a gross fluorescent visualization of the whole rat brain using a low power hand-held UV lamp. Histological data clearly showed that TAT-conjugated Qdots migrated beyond the endothelial cell line and reached the brain parenchyma. Qdots without TAT did not label the brain tissue confirming the fact that TAT peptide was necessary to overcome the BBB. The present study clearly demonstrated the possibility of delivering a large amount of Qdot-based imaging agents to the brain tissue.
SULT1A1 is a phase II detoxification enzyme involved in the biotransformation of a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous phenolic compounds. Human platelet SULT1A1 enzymatic activity shows marked inter-individual variability and a common coding polymorphism, SULT1A1*1/*2, has been described that accounts for a proportion of this variability. We examined the 5'-flanking region of the SULT1A1 gene to determine if genetic variability in this portion of the gene influenced enzymatic activity. Direct sequencing revealed five common genetic polymorphisms (-624G>C, -396G>A, -358A>C, -341C>G and -294T>C) that were present at different allele frequencies in Caucasian, African-American and Chinese groups. Platelet SULT1A1 enzymatic activity was significantly correlated with individual promoter region polymorphisms and the associations were different between African-Americans and Caucasians. Haplotypes were constructed and platelet enzymatic activity according to haplotype was examined. The haplotypes were also significantly correlated with activity; haplotypes GAACT and GGACT (accounting for 13% and 5% of inter-individual variability in platelet activity, respectively) were important in Caucasians while haplotypes GAACC, GAACT and GGACC (accounting for 8%, 5% and 4% of variability) were significantly associated with activity in African-Americans. The coding region polymorphism, SULT1A1*1/*2 was in linkage disequilibrium with the promoter region polymorphisms and showed no effect on activity when examined in the context of the 5'-flanking region polymorphisms. These studies indicate that variation in the promoter region of the SULT1A1 gene exerts a significant influence on enzymatic activity.
ABCA3 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette family of proteins that mediate the translocation of a wide variety of substrates, including lipids, across cellular membranes. Mutations in the gene encoding ABCA3 were recently identified in full-term neonates with fatal surfactant deficiency.
CYP3A5 is the major cytochrome P450 enzyme in the oesophagus and metabolises many potentially carcinogenic compounds. The frequencies of CYP3A5 allelic variants, CYP3A5*2, *3, *6 and *7 which code for enzymes with severely decreased activities were compared between 241 oesophageal cancer patients and 272 controls in Black and Mixed Ancestry South Africans. A significantly higher frequency of CYP3A5*3 was observed in the controls compared to patients amongst the Mixed Ancestry group (P=0.025). Individuals homozygous for defective CYP3A5 had reduced risk of developing oesophageal cancer (P=0.032).
CYP1B1 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme implicated in autosomal recessive primary congenital glaucoma (PCG). The mechanism and function of CYP1B1 in the development of the PCG phenotype is unknown. Previously, investigators have reported detection of Cyp1b1 mRNA in the ciliary body and epithelium and neuroepithelium in the developing mouse eye, employing in situ hybridization techniques. Similarly, additional investigators have detected CYP1B1 mRNA in the iris, ciliary body, non-pigmented ciliary epithelial line, cornea, retinal-pigment epithelium, and retina in the human adult eye, using Northern blotting. This study was designed to immunolocalize CYP1B1 protein in the various ocular structures of normal, human fetal and adult eyes. Normal fetal and adult eyes were immunolabeled with a polyclonal antibody against human CYP1B1 using indirect immunofluorescence, and then compared with appropriate controls. The intensity of immunolabeling of the various ocular structures was assessed by qualitative and semi-quantitative techniques. In the anterior segment anti-CYP1B1 immunoreactivity (IR) was detected early in fetal development in the primitive ciliary epithelium. As well, the most intense CYP1B1 IR was in the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium. In addition, CYP1B1 IR was also present in the corneal epithelium and keratocytes, both layers of the iris pigmented epithelium, and retina. However, CYP1B1 IR was absent in the trabecular meshwork in all of the samples. In general, CYP1B1 immunolabeling in the human fetal eyes was more intense when compared to adult eyes. CYP1B1 IR was primarily immunolocalized to the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium and early in fetal development. In addition, CYP1B1 IR was not detected in the trabecular meshwork. These findings suggest that the abnormalities in the development of the trabecular meshwork in PCG may result from diminished or absent metabolism of important endogenous substrates in the ciliary epithelium due to non-functional CYP1B1 enzyme.
CS spray (2-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile 5% w/v in methyl isobutyl ketone) has been used by the police force in the UK as an incapacitant for nearly a decade. It causes a number of well-recognized cutaneous reactions, which are generally regarded as short-lived. These include skin burning, erythema and blistering. However, a range of unpredictable cutaneous reactions to CS spray may also occur. We have found contact allergy, leukoderma, initiation or exacerbation of seborrhoeic dermatitis, and aggravation of rosacea following CS spray exposure in 6 police officers and 1 doorman. These skin reactions have required long-term changes in working practice for the affected individuals. Police officers may have repeated exposure to CS spray during their training and in their work, and designated police officers carry CS spray canisters daily in the line of duty. They may therefore be at greater risk of exposure to CS spray and its unintended effects than many assailants.
SOD1 is one of several overexpressed genes in trisomy 21. In order to dissect possible genetic causes of the syndrome, wild-type SOD1/SOD1 transgenic mice were compared to FVB/N non-transgenic controls at 5 months of age in tests of exploratory activity and motor coordination. Wild-type SOD1/SOD1 transgenic mice had fewer stereotyped movements in an open-field and fell sooner from a rotorod than controls. In contrast, wild-type SOD1/SOD1 transgenic mice had fewer falls on a wire suspension test. There was no intergroup difference for ambulatory movements in the open-field, exploration of the elevated plus-maze, emergence from a small compartment, and motor coordination on a stationary beam. These results indicate that homozygous mice expressing human SOD1 are impaired in their ability to adjust their posture in response to a moving surface and make fewer small-amplitude movements without any change in general exploratory activity.
ABO histo-bloodgroups are strong transplantation antigens. In bone marrow transplantation, foreign ABO red cell antigens are not ignored by the immune system of the host, neither by the immunocompetent cells of the graft. Although ABO incompatibility is not considered a contraindication in bone marrow transplantation (BMT), its clinical consequences are still a matter of investigation. An overview of reports published by different groups is given and discussed. They present conflicting data regarding the role of the ABO match between patient and donor in the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. We report on the clinical outcome of bone marrow transplantation in 223 patients who received grafts from MHC identical siblings. Included are 139 ABO identical, 32 ABO minor mismatched, 34 major mismatched and 13 bi-directionally mismatched pairs. The statistical evaluation of standard parameters used to monitor the post-transplant period gave a proof that in neither group of patients with an ABO incompatible donor the recovery and success rate of transplantation, including the relapse incidence, risk of graft vs. host disease (GVHD) or overall survival, were significantly inferior. However, in all three cohorts of ABO mismatched patients, a delayed recovery of neutrophils was recorded as compared to the group receiving an ABO compatible graft. These finding leads us to the conclusion that the ABO compatibility is not a disadvantage in BMT, whereas the delayed recovery of neutrophils in patients having received an ABO mismatched graft is probably reflecting a transient humoral process leading to immune tolerance and graft accommodation.
PTEN is a major tumor suppressor gene that has been shown to inhibit cell invasion. Its mutation has been found in 20-40% of malignant gliomas. Meanwhile, the type III EGFR mutation (EGFRvIII), which was frequently found in gliomas, promoted cell invasion. In the present study, the effects of PTEN on cell invasion were investigated in U87DeltaEGFR glioblastoma cells with EGFRvIII expression but missing PTEN. The cell invasion was downregulated by transfection of phosphatase-active forms of PTEN (wild-type and G129E) but not by PTEN (C124A) with an inactive phosphatase domain; the effects were correlated with decreased tyrosine phosphatase levels of FAK at Tyr397, which was increased by EGFRvIII. Overexpression of FAK mutant (Y397F) could partially mimic the effect of PTEN on cell invasion. Although EGFRvIII increased the levels of P-Akt and PTEN eliminated it, PI-3K inhibitors, wortmannin or Ly294002, could not decrease the cell invasion. In conclusion, PTEN could inhibit cell invasion even in the presence of the constitutively active EGFR; this inhibition depended on its protein phosphatase activity, partially by dephosphorylating FAK, but not depended on its lipid phosphatase activity.
ACAT1 (acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1) is thought to have two distinct sterol-binding sites: a substrate-binding site and an allosteric-activator site. In the present work, we investigated the structural features of various sterols as substrates and/or activators in vitro. The results show that without cholesterol, the plant sterol sitosterol is a poor substrate for ACAT. In the presence of cholesterol, ACAT1-mediated esterification of sitosterol is highly activated while ACAT2-mediated esterification of sitosterol is only moderately activated. For ACAT1, we show that the stereochemistry of the 3-hydroxy group at steroid ring A is a critical structural feature for a sterol to serve as a substrate, but less critical for activation. Additionally, enantiomeric cholesterol, which has the same biophysical properties as cholesterol in membranes, fails to activate ACAT1. Thus ACAT1 activation by cholesterol is the result of stereo-specific interactions between cholesterol and ACAT1, and is not related to the biophysical properties of phospholipid membranes. To demonstrate the relevance of the ACAT1 allosteric model in intact cells, we showed that sitosterol esterification in human macrophages is activated upon cholesterol loading. We further show that the activation is not due to an increase in ACAT1 protein content, but is partly due to an increase in the cholesterol content in the endoplasmic reticulum where ACAT1 resides. Together, our results support the existence of a distinct sterol-activator site in addition to the sterol-substrate site of ACAT1 and demonstrate the applicability of the ACAT1 allosteric model in intact cells.
ABCA1 is a critical regulator of lipid efflux from cells, which is highly regulated at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. However, cells from different species and different tissues, and primary versus immortalized cells, show different modes of regulation. We have carried out a comparative analysis of basic signaling pathways of lipid efflux in mouse J774 cells, mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs), human THP-1 cells, and human monocyte-derived macrophages. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) was a potent stimulator of lipid efflux in mouse macrophages, but not in human macrophages. Moreover, this cAMP-inducible component of efflux from MPMs was inhibitable by H89 [a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor], but H89 did not affect basal efflux. On the other hand, cAMP failed to show any stimulatory effect in human macrophages, but basal efflux was inhibitable by H89. In MPMs and THP-1 cells, protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors blocked cholesterol efflux but had no effect on phospholipid efflux, demonstrating the separation of the regulation of phospholipid efflux and cholesterol efflux in macrophages. We conclude that: 1) cAMP regulates lipid efflux predominantly in a PKA-dependent fashion; 2) cholesterol efflux is modulated by a PKC-dependent mechanism; and 3) mouse and human macrophages exhibit different modes of regulation of lipid efflux.
CYP2A6 in man catalyzes the oxidation of nicotine-forming cotinine and 7-hydroxylation of coumarin, which is used as test substrate for CYP2A6 in man. Large interindividual differences are found in man and some are due to genetic polymorphism. The 7-hydroxylation of coumarin is present in pigs, and an inter-individual variation has been found that might be due to polymorphisms. To enable the finding of polymorphism in pigs, the minipig cDNA was sequenced. Two cDNAs were found and translated to a 494 and a 487 amino acid long protein, both cDNAs were found in all but one pig. The 494 a.a. protein showed high homology to the human and 100% homology to the conventional pig CYP2A19 protein. In the wild type protein, all 6 substrate recognition sites were found, whereas the short protein only contained the first 5 substrate recognition sites. SSCP analysis revealed 3 polymorphisms. In order to study the effect of these polymorphisms on enzyme activity, microsomes were incubated with nicotine and coumarin. The polymorphisms appeared to have no effect on either enzyme activity as the specific enzyme activity towards nicotine and coumarin were approximately the same for all pigs. The specificity of pig CYP2A was investigated and it was found that the formation of cotinine correlated with the immunochemical level of CYP2A as did the coumarin hydroxylation. Anti-human CYP2A inhibitory antibody inhibited coumarin 7-hydroxylation by about 90% and formation of cotinine by 44--60% and 85--100% at substrate concentrations of 500 microM and 50 microM respectively, showing that coumarin and nicotine (50 microM) are very specific substrates for CYP2A in pigs, whereas the CYP2A only is responsible for about 50% of the cotinine formation at a 500 microM nicotine incubation concentration. These results show that the large interindividual differences in porcine CYP2A activity are not caused by polymorphisms but transcriptional regulation and the coumarin 7-hydroxylation is as specific a reaction for porcine CYP2A as for human CYP2A6.
CYP2D6 gene duplication causing ultrafast metabolism is one reason for failure in responding to CYP2D6-metabolized antidepressants. We studied the effect of the CYP2D6 duplication genotype on doxepin pharmacokinetics and platelet serotonin uptake and concentrations.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted in chromosome 10) is a candidate tumor suppressor gene. Mutations of this gene are responsible for PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes, including Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, Proteus syndrome, and Proteus -like syndromes. Recently, PTEN mutations were identified in several human neoplasms. We analyzed the DNA of various organs and lesions in Korean patients with Cowden syndrome, their family members, and patients with familial adenomatous polyposis for germline or somatic PTEN mutations.
TAT protein transduction is a novel method of delivering biologically active proteins into cells and tissues through the fusion of a protein transduction domain to the protein of interest. The present chapter outlines the methodology pertaining to the preparation of TAT-fusion proteins and how to efficiently transduce these proteins into cultured cells or isolated rat hearts perfused in Langendorff mode.
ABO is the most important blood group system for transfusion and solid organ transplantation, but it is only over the past 15 years that the techniques for studying its molecular basis became mainstream. Many of its common and rare alleles are now well characterized and by using various expression systems, their effects on the resulting glycosyltransferases are being appreciated. As progress has been made in genetics and glycobiology, so too do reagents used to routinely type red blood cells in the clinical laboratory evolve. Monoclonal reagents are now widely used. This has created difficulties in nomenclature to describe subtype phenotypes as the names of some of these uncommon phenotypes were based on the red blood cell agglutination pattern using polyclonal reagents. In this brief review a discussion of the wild-type ABO allele and the enzymes it encodes is followed by a description of a selection of unusual and fascinating alleles-some that encode enzymes that create both A and B antigens and others that result from hybridization events. A short section on the techniques of ABO allele investigation describes some of the current methodologies used in both research and clinical laboratories.
PTEN and the PI3K/Akt pathway are involved in the development and/or progression of endometrial carcinoma. To clarify the impact of the pathway-related molecules on prognosis, we analyzed PTEN, phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt), and Ki-67 expression by immunohistochemistry in 99 patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma. PTEN-negative or PTEN-mixed staining was found in 66% of tumors. Positive staining of p-Akt was found in 40% of tumors. Loss of PTEN expression (negative or mixed) was significantly associated with positive p-Akt expression. The patients with PTEN-positive and p-Akt-negative expression clearly showed a higher survival rate than patients in the other groups. Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed that the combination of PTEN/Akt expression was an independent prognostic factor. Examining the relationship between p-Akt expression and Ki-67 labeling index (LI), we found that negative p-Akt was related to a decrease in Ki-67 LI. Additionally, the patients with low Ki-67 LI, as determined by p-Akt-expression status, had a better prognosis. In the present study, we demonstrated that PTEN-positive and p-Akt-negative expression was a predictor of survival for patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma. This study suggests the clinical significance of PTEN and p-Akt expression analysis in treatment decisions for patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma.
ABCA1 is essential for the transport of lipids across plasma membranes and for the maintenance of plasma HDL-cholesterol levels. The transcriptional regulation of ABCA1 is complex and is currently poorly understood. We previously generated human ABCA1 bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice that expressed RNA and protein, which allowed us to identify three alternate ABCA1 transcripts. Each transcript arises from different exon 1 sequences (exon1b, exon1c, and exon1d) that are spliced directly into exon 2, which contains the ATG site, and all generate full-length protein. We have now determined the tissue-specific expression of each of these transcripts in humans and mice and have shown that their patterns of expression are similar. Exon1d transcript is predominantly expressed in liver and macrophages and is preferentially increased in the liver in response to a high-fat diet. The exon1b transcript is expressed predominantly in liver, testis, and macrophages, but it is only upregulated in macrophages in response to a high-fat diet. The exon1c transcript is ubiquitously expressed and is upregulated in the brain, stomach, and other tissues in mice on a high-fat diet. Our data indicate that specific transcripts in different tissues play key roles in alterations of ABCA1-mediated changes in HDL levels and atherosclerosis in response to environmental stimuli.
CD36 is involved in high-affinity peripheral FFA uptake. CD36-deficient (cd36(-)(/)(-)) mice exhibit increased plasma FFA and triglyceride (TG) levels. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the cause of the increased plasma TG levels in cd36(-)(/)(-) mice. cd36(-)(/)(-) mice showed no differences in hepatic VLDL-TG production or intestinal [(3)H]TG uptake compared with wild-type littermates. cd36(-)(/)(-) mice showed a 2-fold enhanced postprandial TG response upon an intragastric fat load (P < 0.05), with a concomitant 2.5-fold increased FFA response (P < 0.05), suggesting that the increased FFA in cd36(-/-) mice may impair LPL-mediated TG hydrolysis. Postheparin LPL levels were not affected. However, the in vitro LPL-mediated TG hydrolysis rate as induced by postheparin plasma of cd36(-)(/)(-) mice in the absence of excess FFA-free BSA was reduced 2-fold compared with wild-type plasma (P < 0.05). This inhibition was relieved upon the addition of excess FFA-free BSA. Likewise, increasing plasma FFA in wild-type mice to the levels observed in cd36(-)(/)(-) mice by infusion prolonged the plasma half-life of glycerol tri[(3)H]oleate-labeled VLDL-like emulsion particles by 2.5-fold (P < 0.05). We conclude that the increased plasma TG levels observed in cd36(-)(/)(-) mice are caused by decreased LPL-mediated hydrolysis of TG-rich lipoproteins resulting from FFA-induced product inhibition of LPL.
ABO blood group antigens are immunodominant cell surface oligosaccharides. The function of the ABO system is clinically important in blood transfusion and solid organ transplantation but there is no small animal model of ABO discordance. The present study demonstrated A glycoconjugate-reactive IgM in the serum of CBA/Ca mice by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay but showed with sugar blocking that the specificity of this IgM was different from that of human anti-A IgM. Furthermore, immunisation of CBA/Ca mice with the A antigen did not increase reactive IgM titre. In contrast, knock-out mice for the related carbohydrate antigen galactose(alpha1,3)galactose mounted a serum IgM response when immunised with the non-self galactose(alpha1,3)galactose antigen, which was shown to be T cell-dependent using a nude/knock-out animal. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction identified transcripts for the enzyme likely to be responsible for the synthesis of the A antigen in organs from CBA/Ca mice although the A antigen was not detected in the same organs by immunohistochemistry. We conclude that CBA/Ca mice possess natural serum IgM with different characteristics to human anti-A IgM and that CBA/Ca mice may also express the A antigen. As a result, these mice are not suitable for use as a small animal model of ABO discordance.
PDE4B and PDE4D provide >90% of PDE4 cAMP phosphodiesterase activity in human embryonic kidney (HEK293B2) cells. Their selective small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown potentiates isoprenaline-stimulated protein kinase A (PKA) activation. Whereas endogenous PDE4D co-immunoprecipitates with beta arrestin, endogenous PDE4B does not, even upon PDE4D knockdown. Ectopic overexpression of PDE4B2 confers co-immunoprecipitation with beta arrestin. Knockdown of PDE4D, but not PDE4B, amplifies isoprenaline-stimulated phosphorylation of the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) by PKA and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) through G(i). Isoform-selective knockdown identifies PDE4D5 as the functionally important species regulating isoprenaline stimulation of both these processes. Ht31-mediated disruption of the tethering of PKA to AKAP scaffold proteins attenuates isoprenaline activation of ERK, even upon PDE4D knockdown. Selective siRNA-mediated knockdown identifies AKAP79, which is constitutively associated with the beta2-AR, rather than isoprenaline-recruited gravin, as being the functionally relevant AKAP in this process. Isoprenaline-stimulated membrane recruitment of PDE4D is ablated upon beta arrestin knockdown. A mutation that compromises interactions with beta arrestin prevents catalytically inactive PDE4D5 from performing a dominant negative role in potentiating isoprenaline-stimulated ERK activation. Beta arrestin-recruited PDE4D5 desensitizes isoprenaline-stimulated PKA phosphorylation of the beta2-AR and the consequential switching of its signaling to ERK. The ability to observe a cellular phenotype upon PDE4D5 knockdown demonstrates that other PDE4 isoforms, expressed at endogenous levels, are unable to afford rescue in HEK293B2 cells.
ABO histo-blood group type and secretor status are two genetically determined factors that contribute to resistance and susceptibility to Norwalk virus (NV). Archived serum samples but not saliva samples are available from NV and many other norovirus challenge studies and outbreaks. A person's ABO phenotype is easily determined from their archived sera, but the individual's secretor phenotype cannot easily be ascertained without saliva. We now report that a person's secretor genotype can also be determined from the archived serum samples. Of the 51 volunteers who participated in a NV challenge study, all eight non-secretors were resistant to NV infection, all of the 42 NV-infected volunteers were secretor positive, and a single uninfected secretor was histo-blood group type B. In agreement with a previous report, secretor status was most predictive of risk of NV infection. The methods described in this report should rapidly improve our knowledge of the associations between carbohydrate antigen expression and susceptibility to different strains of the non-cultivatable noroviruses by enabling retrospective studies from previously collected volunteer challenge and outbreak sera.
ELOVL4 (elongation of very long chain fatty acids 4) is a member of the ELO family of proteins involved in the biosynthesis of very long chain fatty acids. Protein truncation mutations in ELOVL4 have been identified in patients with autosomal dominant Stargardt-like macular degeneration. To determine whether a dominant negative mechanism is responsible for the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of this disease, we studied the subcellular localization and interaction of wild type and mutant ELOVL4 in COS-7 and HEK 293T cultured cells by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation. Wild type ELOVL4 containing an endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum as expected. In contrast, disease-associated C-terminal truncation ELOVL4 mutants accumulated as large inclusions exhibiting aggresome-like characteristics in a juxtanuclear position within COS-7 cells. When the wild type and mutant proteins were co-expressed incultured cells, wild type ELOVL4 co-purified with mutant ELOVL4 on an immunoaffinity column and co-localized with the mutant protein in aggresome-like inclusions adjacent to the nucleus. These results indicate that wild type and mutant ELOVL4 form a complex that exhibits an abnormal subcellular localization found for individually expressed mutant ELOVL4. From these studies, we conclude that disease-linked C-terminal truncation mutants of ELOVL4 exert a dominant negative effect on wild type ELOVL4, altering its subcellular localization. This dominant negative mechanism contributes to the autosomal dominant inheritance of Stargardt-like macular dystrophy.
CYP11B2 is the enzyme responsible for aldosterone synthesis mainly in the adrenal gland. In this study, we hypothesized that CYP11B2 gene, protein, and aldosterone are produced locally in kidney and regulated by low salt intake, angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor and insulin-deficient diabetes hyperglycemia. We used real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry staining, and microdialysis techniques to monitor changes in renal CYP11B2 mRNA and protein and aldosterone production in normal, adrenalectomized, or streptozotocin-induced insulin-deficient diabetic hyperglycemic rats. In normal kidney, CYP11B2 mRNA and protein were localized mainly in the renal cortex and upregulated by angiotensin II and low salt intake. The angiotensin II effect was reversed by AT1 receptor blocker valsartan. Immunohistochemistry staining demonstrated presence of CYP11B2 in glomeruli. Although aldosterone was absent in plasma of adrenalectomized rats, it was present in renal interstitium and tissue. Diabetes increased renal cortical and total kidney CYP11B2 mRNA and protein. Lowering blood glucose with insulin decreased total renal CYP11B2 mRNA and protein. Despite lack of significant changes in blood glucose, valsartan treatment caused significant reduction in renal CYP11B2 mRNA and protein. In presence of diabetes, there was an increase in CYP11B2 immunostaining in glomeruli and proximal tubules. This expression was abrogated with insulin or valsartan treatment. These results demonstrate the presence of all components of local renal aldosterone system. This system is physiologically active because it is regulated by angiotensin II and low salt intake. In insulin-deficient diabetes hyperglycemia rat model, glucose, insulin, and AT1 receptor modulate CYP11B2 expression in the kidney.
ABO blood group antigens, of great importance in transplantation and transfusion, are present on virtually all cells, as well as in soluble form in plasma and body fluids. Naturally occurring plasma IgM and IgG antibodies against these antigens are ubiquitous. Nonetheless, the ABO blood group system is widely ignored by many transfusion services, except for purposes of red cell transfusion. We implemented a policy of transfusing only ABO identical platelets and red cells in patients undergoing stem cell transplantation or treatment for hematologic malignancies. Major bleeding episodes have occurred in about 5% of patients undergoing induction therapy for acute leukemia as compared with 15-20% in the literature. Overall survival times appear to be superior to that in historical cohorts. In 2002-2004, treatment-related mortality at 100 days in our Blood and Marrow Transplant Unit was 0.7% for autologous transplants (n=148), 13% for sibling allogeneic transplants (n=110), and 24% (n=62) for matched unrelated allogeneic transplants, suggesting that our approach is safe. We speculate that more rigorous efforts on the part of transfusion services to provide ABO identical blood components, and to remove incompatible supernatant plasma, when necessary, might yield reduced morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing stem cell transplantation.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor whose function is frequently lost in human cancer. It possesses a lipid phosphatase activity that represses the activation of PI3 kinase/Akt signaling, leading to decreased cell growth, proliferation, and survival. The potential for PTEN to regulate transcription of the large rRNAs by RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) was investigated. As increased synthesis of rRNAs is a hallmark of neoplastic transformation, the ability of PTEN to control the transcription of rRNAs might be crucial for its tumor suppressor function. The expression of PTEN in PTEN-deficient cells represses RNA Pol I transcription, while decreasing PTEN expression enhances transcription. PTEN-mediated repression requires its lipid phosphatase activity and is independent of the p53 status of the cell. This event can be uncoupled from PTEN's ability to regulate the cell cycle. RNA Pol I is regulated through PI3 kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin/S6 kinase, and the expression of constitutively activated S6 kinase is able to abrogate transcription repression by PTEN. No change in the expression of the RNA Pol I transcription components, upstream binding factor or SL1, was observed upon PTEN expression. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that PTEN differentially reduces the occupancy of the SL1 subunits on the rRNA gene promoter. Furthermore, PTEN induces dissociation of the SL1 subunits. Together, these results demonstrate that PTEN represses RNA Pol I transcription through a novel mechanism that involves disruption of the SL1 complex.
NPC1L1 encodes a putative intestinal sterol transporter which is the likely target for ezetimibe, a new type of lipid-lowering medication. We previously reported rare non-synonymous mutations in NPC1L1 in an individual who had no plasma lipoprotein response to ezetimibe. We next hypothesized that common variants in NPC1L1 would underlie less extreme inter-individual variations in the plasma LDL cholesterol response to ezetimibe.
CYP2C9 was recently resequenced in 150 Asian subjects from Singapore. Several new coding variants were reported, and these variants are now named CYP2C9*14 (R125H), CYP2C9*15 (S162X), CYP2C9*16 (T299A), CYP2C9*17 (P382S), CYP2C9*18 (D397A), and CYP2C9*19 (Q454H). The CYP2C9*18 variant also contained an I359L change previously associated with the CYP2C9*3 allele. In this study, we assessed the functional consequences of the new coding changes. cDNAs containing each of the new coding changes were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in a bacterial cDNA expression system, the allelic proteins were partially purified, and their ability to hydroxylate a prototype CYP2C9 substrate was assayed. Expression of cDNAs in Escherichia coli containing either the D397A change or the S162X (premature stop codon) could not be detected either spectrally or at the apoprotein level. CYP2C9.14 and CYP2C9.16 exhibited 80 to 90% lower catalytic activity toward tolbutamide at two substrate concentrations compared with wild-type CYP2C9.1. Kinetic analysis confirmed that CYP2C9.14 and CYP2C9.16 have a higher Km and a >90% lower intrinsic clearance of tolbutamide compared with wild-type CYP2C9.1. Both CYP2C9.17 and CYP2C9.19 proteins exhibited modest 30 to 40% decreases in catalytic activity toward tolbutamide. Thus, CYP2C9*15 and CYP2C9*18 may represent null alleles, whereas CYP2C9*14 and CYP2C9*16 allelic variants produce proteins that are clearly catalytically defective in vitro, indicating the existence of new defective putative alleles of CYP2C9 in Asians.
SLC7A11 (xCT), together with SLC3A2 (4F2hc), encodes the heterodimeric amino acid transport system x(c)-, which mediates cystine-glutamate exchange and thereby regulates intracellular glutathione levels. We used microarrays to analyze gene expression of transporters in 60 human cancer cell lines used by the National Cancer Institute for drug screening (NCI-60). The expression of SLC7A11 showed significant correlation with that of SLC3A2 (r = 0.66), which in turn correlated with SLC7A5 (r = 0.68), another known partner for SLC3A2, and with T1A-2 (r = 0.60; all P < 0.0001). Linking expression of SLC7A11 with potency of 1,400 candidate anticancer drugs identified 39 showing positive correlations, e.g., amino acid analogue, L-alanosine, and 296 with negative correlations, e.g., geldanamycin. However, no significant correlation was observed with the geldanamycin analogue 17-allylamino, 17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). Inhibition of transport system x(c)- with glutamate or (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine in lung A549 and HOP-62, and ovarian SK-OV-3 cells, reduced the potency of L-alanosine and lowered intracellular glutathione levels. This further resulted in increased potency of geldanamycin, with no effect on 17-AAG. Down-regulation of SLC7A11 by small interfering RNA affected drug potencies similarly to transport inhibitors. The inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, buthionine sulfoximine, also decreased intracellular glutathione levels and enhanced potency of geldanamycin, but did not affect L-alanosine. These results indicate that SLC7A11 mediates cellular uptake of L-alanosine but confers resistance to geldanamycin by supplying cystine for glutathione maintenance. SLC7A11 expression could serve as a predictor of cellular response to L-alanosine and glutathione-mediated resistance to geldanamycin, yielding a potential target for increasing chemosensitivity to multiple drugs.
ABCG2 is an ATP binding cassette (ABC) half-transporter that plays a key role in multidrug resistance to chemotherapy. ABCG2 is believed to be a functional homodimer that has been proposed to be linked by disulfide bridges. We have investigated the structural and functional role of the only three cysteines predicted to be on the extracellular face of ABCG2. Upon mutation of Cys-592 or Cys-608 to alanine (C592A and C608A), ABCG2 migrated as a dimer in SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions; however, mutation of Cys-603 to Ala (C603A) caused the transporter to migrate as a single monomeric band. Despite this change, C603A displayed efficient membrane targeting and preserved transport function. Because the transporter migrated as a dimer in SDS-PAGE, when only Cys-603 was present (C592A-C608A), the data suggest that Cys-603 forms a symmetrical intermolecular disulfide bridge in the ABCG2 homodimer that is not essential for protein expression and function. In contrast to C603A, both C592A and C608A displayed impaired membrane targeting and function. Moreover, when only Cys-592 or Cys-608 were present (C592A/C603A and C603A/C608A), the transporter displayed impaired plasma membrane expression and function. The combined mutation (C592A/C608A) partially restored plasma membrane expression; however, although transport of mitoxantrone was almost normal, we observed impairment of BODIPY-prazosin transport. This supports the conclusion that Cys-592 and Cys-608 form an intramolecular disulfide bridge in ABCG2 that is critical for substrate specificity. Finally, mutation of all three cysteines simultaneously resulted in low expression and no measurable function. Altogether, our data are consistent with a scenario in which an inter- and an intramolecular disulfide bridge together are of fundamental importance for the structural and functional integrity of ABCG2.
PTEN is an important tumor suppressor gene. Hereditary mutation of PTEN causes tumor-susceptibility diseases such as Cowden disease. We used the Cre-loxP system to generate an endothelial cell-specific mutation of Pten (Tie2CrePten) in mice. Tie2CrePten(flox/+) mice displayed enhanced tumorigenesis due to an increase in angiogenesis driven by vascular growth factors. This effect was partially dependent on the PI3K subunits p85alpha and p110gamma. In vitro, Tie2CrePten(flox/+) endothelial cells showed enhanced proliferation/migration. Tie2CrePten(flox/flox) mice died before embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) due to bleeding and cardiac failure caused by impaired recruitment of pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells to blood vessels, and of cardiomyocytes to the endocardium. These phenotypes depend strongly on p110gamma rather than on p85alpha and were associated with decreased expression of Ang-1, VCAM-1, connexin 40, and ephrinB2 but increased expression of Ang-2, VEGF-A, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2. Pten is thus indispensable for normal cardiovascular morphogenesis and post-natal angiogenesis, including tumor angiogenesis.
CYP2C9 is a major P450 2C enzyme, which hydroxylates about 16% of drugs that are in current clinical use and contributes to the metabolism of a number of clinically important substrate drugs such as warfarin. Ethnic differences in the genetic variation of CYP2C9 have been reported, and might be related to the frequencies of adverse reactions to drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 in different ethnic groups. In the present study, ethnic differences in the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 allele distribution in Japanese and Israeli populations were evaluated using a newly developed oligonucleotide based DNA array (OligoArray(R)). The population studied consisted of 147 Japanese and 388 Israeli donors (100 Ashkenazi Jews, 99 Yemenite Jews, 100 Moroccan Jews and 89 Libyan Jews). The CYP2C9*2 [Arg144Cys (416 C>T), exon 3] and CYP2C9*3 [Ile359Leu (1061 A>C), exon 7] genotypes were determined using an OligoArray(R). The accuracy of genotyping by the OligoArray(R) was verified by the fluorescent dye-terminator cycle sequencing method. A Hardy-Weinberg test indicated equilibrium (chi(2)<3.84 is Hardy-Weinberg) in all populations. The CYP2C9*2 genotype (CC/CT+TT) was absent in Japanese (1/0) (OR 0.02), and its frequency was significant in Libyan Jews (0.697/0.303) (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.07-4.24) compared with Ashkenazi Jews (0.83/0.17), Yemenite Jews (0.899/0.101), and Moroccan Jews (0.81/0.19). The frequencies of CYP2C9*3 genotype (AA/AC+CC) was significantly lower in Japanese (0.986/0.014) (OR 0.08), and was higher in Libyan Jews (0.652/0.348) (OR 3.03; 95% CI 1.5-6.1) and Moroccan Jews (0.77/0.23) (OR 1.69; 95% CI 0.62-3.48) compared with those in Ashkenazi Jews (0.85/0.15) and Yemenite Jews (0.849/0.151). Thus, the CYP2C9*2 (Arg144Cys) and CYP2C9*3 (Ile359Leu) variants were rare in the Japanese population, and showed different frequencies in the four Jewish ethnic groups examined.
TPK1 (formerly KCO1) is the founding member of the family of two-pore domain K(+) channels in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which originally was described following expression in Sf9 insect cells as a Ca(2+)- and voltage-dependent outwardly rectifying plasma membrane K(+) channel. In plants, this channel has been shown by green fluorescent protein fusion to localize to the vacuolar membrane, which led to speculations that the TPK1 gene product would be a component of the nonselective, Ca(2+) and voltage-dependent slow-vacuolar (SV) cation channel found in many plants species. Using yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as an expression system for TPK1, we show functional expression of the channel in the vacuolar membrane. In isolated vacuoles of yeast yvc1 disruption mutants, the TPK1 gene product shows ion channel activity with some characteristics very similar to the SV-type channel. The open channel conductance of TPK1 in symmetrically 100 mM KCl is slightly asymmetric with roughly 40 pS at positive membrane voltages and 75 pS at negative voltages. Similar to the SV-type channel, TPK1 is activated by cytosolic Ca(2+), requiring micromolar concentration for activation. However, in contrast to the SV-type channel, TPK1 exhibits strong selectivity for K(+) over Na(+), and its activity turned out to be independent of the membrane voltage over the range of +/-80 mV. Our data clearly demonstrate that TPK1 is a voltage-independent, Ca(2+)-activated, K(+)-selective ion channel in the vacuolar membrane that does not mediate SV-type ionic currents.
DGAT1 is a microsomal enzyme that catalyses the final step in triglycerides synthesis. DGAT1-deficient mice are viable, lean, fertile and resistant to diet induced obesity. We have previously identified a quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosome 4 that affects fatty acid composition in an F2 cross between Iberian x Landrace. The human DGAT1 gene is located on chromosome 8q24.3, this region aligns to porcine chromosome 4, making the pig DGAT1 gene a suggestive positional candidate gene for the QTL. In this study, we sequenced 1679 bp of the mRNA from animals of five pig breeds (Iberian, Landrace, Large White, Piétrian and Meishan) to identify genetic variants. One of the polymorphisms found creates a polymorphic HinfI restriction site and it was genotyped by PCR-RFLP in these five pig breeds. Allele A was not found in the analysed Iberian and Landrace populations, whereas Meishan population presents the highest frequency (35%). The DGAT1 gene was located by radiation hybrid mapping to the porcine chromosome 4, outside the confidence interval for the fatty acid composition QTL and excludes it as a positional candidate gene.
CYP1A1 is an extrahepatic enzyme largely involved in the bioactivation of various procarcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and arylamines. CYP1A1 expression is mainly regulated by AhR. Our laboratory has recently shown a new CYP1A1 regulation pathway involving PPARalpha. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a Caco-2 cell line, the effect of a coexposure to 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC, AhR ligand) and WY-14643 (WY, PPARalpha ligand) on CYP1A1 expression (enzymatic activity, mRNA level and promoter activity). An additive effect on CYP1A1 expression was shown in cells coexposed with 3MC (0.1 or 1 microM) and a low WY concentration (30 microM) whereas a potentiating effect was observed after coexposure with 3MC (0.1 or 1 microM) and a high WY concentration (200 microM). Furthermore, 200 microM WY, alone or with 3MC, was able to increase the AhR protein level (two-fold). In conclusion, coexposure with 3MC and the PPARalpha agonist WY leads to an additive or potentiating effect on CYP1A1 inducibility, depending on the WY concentration. Furthermore, at high concentration (200 microM), WY induced AhR expression, which could explain the potentiating effect on CYP1A1 inducibility observed after addition of an AhR ligand (3MC). This phenomenon should be taken into account for risk assessment involving CYP1A1 induction.
ABCB1 (multidrug resistance 1 polypeptide, MDR1, Pgp) is a multispecific efflux transporter of drugs and xenobiotics. Among numerous polymorphisms in human ABCB1, the synonymous SNP 3435C > T has been associated with decreased mRNA and protein levels, via unknown mechanisms.
SULT1A1 is involved in biotransformation of many endogenous and exogenous substrates, such as drugs, hormones and tobacco smoke carcinogens. A polymorphism in the sulfotransferase 1A1 gene (SULT1A1) results in an amino acid change from Arg to His at codon 213. The His allele (SULT1A1*2) has been shown to encode a protein with much lower catalytic activity than the protein encoded by the Arg allele (SULT1A1*1). We examined whether this polymorphism modified breast cancer risk in a Finnish-Caucasian study population consisting of 483 breast cancer patients and 482 healthy population controls. No significant genotype effects were seen in the overall breast cancer risk. However, a decreased risk of breast cancer was found among premenopausal women with at least three pregnancies and at least one SULT1A1*2 allele (odds ratio = 0.23, 95% confidence interval = 0.09-0.63) compared to women with two SULT1A1*1 alleles. Our results suggest that the SULT1A1 genotype is not an important risk factor for breast cancer in general, but may modify the risk among premenopausaul women with high parity.
ACE inhibitors are commonly used drugs in the management of adult hypertension. However their use in pregnant women can have serious effects on the fetus. In this manuscript we report a case of fatal neonatal renal failure associated with maternal intake of enalapril during third trimester and review the related literature.
PDE3A (phosphodiesterase 3A) was identified as a phosphoprotein that co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous 14-3-3 proteins from HeLa cell extracts, and binds directly to 14-3-3 proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Among cellular stimuli tested, PMA promoted maximal binding of PDE3A to 14-3-3 proteins. While p42/p44 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), SAPK2 (stress-activated protein kinase 2)/p38 and PKC (protein kinase C) were all activated by PMA in HeLa cells, the PMA-induced binding of PDE3A to 14-3-3 proteins was inhibited by the non-specific PKC inhibitors Ro 318220 and H-7, but not by PD 184352, which inhibits MAPK activation, nor by SB 203580 and BIRB0796, which inhibit SAPK2 activation. Binding of PDE3A to 14-3-3 proteins was also blocked by the DNA replication inhibitors aphidicolin and mimosine, but the PDE3A-14-3-3 interaction was not cell-cycle-regulated. PDE3A isolated from cells was able to bind to 14-3-3 proteins after in vitro phosphorylation with PKC isoforms. Using MS/MS of IMAC (immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography)-enriched tryptic phosphopeptides and phosphospecific antibodies, at least five sites on PDE3A were found to be phosphorylated in vivo, of which Ser428 was selectively phosphorylated in response to PMA and dephosphorylated in cells treated with aphidicolin and mimosine. Phosphorylation of Ser428 therefore correlated with 14-3-3 binding to PDE3A. Ser312 of PDE3A was phosphorylated in an H-89-sensitive response to forskolin, indicative of phosphorylation by PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase), but phosphorylation at this site did not stimulate 14-3-3 binding. Thus 14-3-3 proteins can discriminate between sites in a region of multisite phosphorylation on PDE3A. An additional observation was that the cytoskeletal cross-linker protein plectin-1 coimmunoprecipitated with PDE3A independently of 14-3-3 binding.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene whose loss of function is observed in approximately 40-50% of human cancers. Although insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) was classically described as a growth inhibitor, multiple recent reports have shown an association of overexpression and/or high serum levels of IGFBP-2 with poor prognosis of several malignancies, including gliomas. Using an inducible PTEN expression system in the PTEN-null glioma cell line U251, we demonstrate that PTEN-induction is associated with reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and a substantial reduction of the high levels of IGFBP-2 expression. The PTEN-induced decrease in IGFBP-2 expression could be mimicked with the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, indicating that the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is responsible for the observed effect. However, the rapamycin analog CCI-779 did not affect IGFBP-2 expression, suggesting that the PTEN-induced decrease in IGFBP-2 expression is not attributable to decreased mTOR signalling. Recombinant human IGFBP-2 was unable to rescue U251-PTEN cells from the antiproliferative effects of PTEN, and IGFBP-2 siRNA did not affect the IGF-dependent or -independent growth of this cell line. These results suggest that the clinical data linking IGFBP-2 expression to poor prognosis may arise, at least in part, because high levels of IGFBP-2 expression correlate with loss of function of PTEN, which is well known to lead to aggressive behavior of gliomas. Our results motivate translational research regarding the relationship between IGFBP-2 expression and loss of function of PTEN.
CYP2C8 is genetically polymorphic. Four variants, CYP2C8*2, CYP2C8*3, CYP2C8*4 and CYP2C8*5, which contain mutations in the coding regions have been reported to exhibit different enzyme activity as compared with CYP2C8*1.
ABCG2 is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that confers resistance to various chemotherapeutic agents. Recent studies have established that an Arg (wild-type) to Gly mutation at amino acid 482 in ABCG2 alters substrate specificity. Here, we explored the role of this G482 mutation in antifolate resistance using a clinically relevant 4-hour drug exposure. Stable transfectants overexpressing the mutant G482 transporter displayed 120-, 1,000-, and >6,250-fold resistance to the antifolates methotrexate, GW1843, and Tomudex, respectively, relative to parental human embryonic kidney cells. Moreover, although overexpressing equal transporter levels at the plasma membrane, G482-ABCG2 cells were 6-, 23-, and >521-fold more resistant to methotrexate, GW1843, and Tomudex, respectively, than R482-ABCG2 cells. In contrast, upon a continuous (72-hour) drug exposure, both the G482- and R482-ABCG2 cells lost almost all their antifolate resistance; this result was consistent with the inability of ABCG2 to extrude long-chain antifolate polyglutamates. Ko143, a specific and potent ABCG2 inhibitor reversed methotrexate resistance in both G482- and R482-ABCG2 cells. Consistently, whereas the pool of free methotrexate in parental human embryonic kidney cells was prominent after 4 hours of transport with 1 micromol/L [3H]methotrexate, in R482- and G482-ABCG2 cells, it was minimal. Furthermore, G482-ABCG2 cells contained marked decreases in the di- and triglutamate species of [3H]methotrexate at 4 hours of incubation with methotrexate and in the tetra- and pentaglutamates at 24 hours. These changes were not associated with any significant decrease in folylypoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase activity. These results provide the first evidence that the G482-ABCG2 mutation confers high-level resistance to various hydrophilic antifolates.
"PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is a negative regulator of the oncogenic PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway. Loss-of-function mutations of PTEN are seen in several human solid cancers. A murine model of conditional Pten inactivation in the pancreas is described that leads to acquisition of a profound metaplastic ductal phenotype accompanied by loss of differentiated acinar units. Evidence is presented for a centroacinar cell origin of the metaplastic ""neoductules."" These mice also develop invasive pancreatic adenocarcinomas at a low frequency, and provide a unique in vivo platform for exploring the role of PI3-K/Akt signaling in pancreatic neoplasia."
CFTR expression is tightly controlled by a complex network of ubiquitous and tissue-specific cis-elements and trans-factors. To better understand mechanisms that regulate transcription of CFTR, we examined transcription factors that specifically bind a CFTR CArG-like motif we have previously shown to modulate CFTR expression. Gel mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated the CFTR CArG-like motif binds serum response factor both in vitro and in vivo. Transient co-transfections with various SRF expression vector, including dominant-negative forms and small interfering RNA, demonstrated that SRF significantly increases CFTR transcriptional activity in bronchial epithelial cells. Mutagenesis studies suggested that in addition to SRF other co-factors, such as Yin Yang 1 (YY1) previously shown to bind the CFTR promoter, are potentially involved in the CFTR regulation. Here, we show that functional interplay between SRF and YY1 might provide interesting perspectives to further characterize the underlying molecular mechanism of the basal CFTR transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the identification of multiple CArG binding sites in highly conserved CFTR untranslated regions, which form specific SRF complexes, provides direct evidence for a considerable role of SRF in the CFTR transcriptional regulation into specialized epithelial lung cells.
GAPDH is a redox-sensitive glycolytic enzyme that also promotes apoptosis when translocated to the nucleus and associates with aggregate-prone proteins involved in neurodegenerative disorders. Recent evidence indicates that polymorphic variation within GAPDH genes is associated with an elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously demonstrated that GAPDH readily undergoes disulfide bonding following oxidant exposure, although the consequence of disulfide bonding on GAPDH activity or function is unknown. Here we show that increased GAPDH disulfide bonding is observed in detergent-insoluble extracts from AD patient and transgenic AD mouse brain tissue compared with age-matched controls. Exposure of primary rat cortical neurons to the pro-oxidant amyloid beta peptide promotes nuclear accumulation of a disulfide-linked form of GAPDH, which becomes detergent-insoluble. Disulfide bonding leads to a reduction in GAPDH enzymatic activity and correlates with the appearance of punctate aggregate-like GAPDH staining within the cytoplasm of both oxidant-treated HT22 cells and amyloid beta-treated primary cortical neurons. Our findings suggest that disulfide bonding of GAPDH and subsequent protein aggregate formation may have relevance to the pathophysiology of AD.
ACE inhibition protects kidney function, but ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism affects renal prognosis in type 1 diabetic patients. ACE genotype may influence the renal benefits of ACE inhibition. We studied the impact of ACE I/D polymorphism on the renal hemodynamic changes induced by ACE inhibition in type 1 diabetes. We studied renal hemodynamics (glomerular filtration rate [GFR], effective renal plasma flow [ERPF], filtration fraction [GFR/ERPF], mean arterial pressure [MAP], and total renal resistances [MAP/ERPF]) repeatedly during normoglycemia and then hyperglycemia in 12 normotensive, normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetes and the II genotype (associated with nephroprotection) versus 22 age- and sex-matched subjects with the ACE D allele after three randomly allocated 2- to 6-week periods on placebo, 1.25 mg/day ramipril, and 5 mg/day ramipril in a double-blind, cross-over study. During normoglycemia, the hemodynamic changes induced by ramipril were similar in both genotypes. During hyperglycemia, the changes induced by ramipril were accentuated in the II genotype group and attenuated dose dependently in the D allele group (treatment-genotype interaction P values for ERPF, 0.018; MAP, 0.018; and total renal resistances, 0.055). These results provide a basis to different renal responses to ACE inhibition according to ACE genotype in type 1 diabetes.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene associated with multiple tumor types. PTEN function is essential for early embryonic development and is involved in the regulation of cell size, number, and survival. By dephosphorylating PIP(3), PTEN normally acts to inhibit the PI3-Kinase/AKT pathway. Here we have identified two zebrafish orthologs, ptena and ptenb, of the single mammalian PTEN gene and analyzed the role of these genes in zebrafish development. Ptena transcripts were expressed throughout the embryo at early somitogenesis. By 24 hpf, expression was predominant in the central nervous system, axial vasculature, retina, branchial arches, ear, lateral line primordium, and pectoral fin bud. Ptenb was also ubiquitously expressed early in somitogenesis, but transcripts became more restricted to the somites and central nervous system as development progressed. By 48 hpf, ptena and ptenb were expressed predominantly in the central nervous system, branchial arches, pectoral fins, and eye. Antisense morpholinos were used to knock down translation of ptena and ptenb mRNA in zebrafish embryos. Knockdown of either pten gene caused increased levels of phosphorylated Akt in morphant embryos, indicating that Ptena and Ptenb each possess PIP(3) lipid phosphatase activity. Ptena morphants had irregularities in notochord shape (73%), vasculogenesis (83%), head shape (72%), and inner ear development (59%). The most noticeable defects in ptenb morphants were upward hooked tails (73%), domed heads (83%), and reduced yolk extensions (90%). These results indicate that ptena and ptenb encode functional enzymes and that each pten gene plays a distinct role during zebrafish embryogenesis.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 10q23 and is amongst the most commonly mutated genes in human cancers. The lipid phosphatase activity of Pten enables it to dephosphorylate PIP3, thereby antagonizing growth factor stimulated PI3-kinase signaling mediated by AKT/PKB. The growth inhibition effect of PTEN has been shown to be mediated by p27 which is one of the important effector molecules downstream of the AKT pathway. Recently the importance of the Pten and AKT pathway in the regulation of the immune system and development of hematological malignancies has been shown. Loss of Pten and p27 expressions were examined immunohistochemically in 45 patients with peripheral T- and NK-cell lymphoma. Partial or complete loss of Pten was detected in 66.7% of the cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) compared to only 12.5% of all other mature T-/NK-cell lymphomas combined. Loss of p27 was identified in 64.9% of cases, which showed a positive correlation with Pten loss. In this study, we showed that loss of Pten is more frequent in ALCL as compared to other mature T-/NK-cell lymphomas, which strongly correlates with the loss of p27 expression. Our findings provide further evidence for the importance of the deregulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway in ALCL.
CP violation in B-->J/PsiK* decays is studied using an angular analysis in a data sample of 253 fb(-1) recorded with the Belle detector at the KEKB e(+)e(-) collider. The flavor separated measurements of the decay amplitudes indicate no evidence for direct CP violation. T-odd CP violation is studied using the asymmetries in triple product correlations, and the results are consistent with the standard model null predictions. The time-dependent angular analysis gives the following values of CP-violating parameters: sin(2phi(1) = 0.24 +/- 0.31 +/- 0.05 and cos(2phi(1)=0.56 +/- 0.79 +/- 0.11.
ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) is a major regulator of cholesterol efflux and high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism. Mutations in human ABCA1 cause severe HDL deficiencies characterized by the virtual absence of apoA-I and HDL and prevalent atherosclerosis. Recently, it has been reported that the lack of ABCA1 causes a significant reduction of apoE protein level in the brain of ABCA1 knock-out (ABCA1-/-) mice. ApoE isoforms strongly affect Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology and risk. To determine further the effect of ABCA1 on amyloid deposition, we used APP23 transgenic mice in which the human familial Swedish AD mutant is expressed only in neurons. We demonstrated that the targeted disruption of ABCA1 increases amyloid deposition in APP23 mice, and the effect is manifested by an increased level of Abeta immunoreactivity, as well as thioflavine S-positive plaques in brain parenchyma. We found that the lack of ABCA1 also considerably increased the level of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and exacerbated cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related microhemorrhage in APP23/ABCA1-/- mice. Remarkably, the elevation in parenchymal and vascular amyloid in APP23/ABCA1-/- mice was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the level of soluble brain apoE, although insoluble apoE was not changed. The elevation of insoluble Abeta fraction in old APP23/ABCA1-/- mice, accompanied by a lack of changes in APP processing and soluble beta-amyloid in young APP23/ABCA1-/- animals, supports the conclusion that the ABCA1 deficiency increases amyloid deposition. These results suggest that ABCA1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of parenchymal and cerebrovascular amyloid pathology and thus may be considered a therapeutic target in AD.
ABCA1 mediates the transport of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to HDL apolipoproteins. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) interactions with ABCA1-expressing cells elicit several responses, including removing cellular lipids, stabilizing ABCA1 protein, and activating Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). Here, we used synthetic apolipoprotein-mimetic peptides to characterize the relationship between these responses. Peptides containing one amphipathic helix of L- or D-amino acids (2F, D-2F, or 4F) and a peptide containing two helices (37pA) all promoted ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux, competed for apoA-I binding to ABCA1-expressing cells, blocked covalent cross-linking of apoA-I to ABCA1, and inhibited ABCA1 degradation. 37pA was cross-linked to ABCA1, confirming the direct binding of amphipathic helices to ABCA1. 2F, 4F, 37pA, and D-37pA all stimulated JAK2 autophosphorylation. Inhibition of JAK2 greatly reduced peptide-mediated cholesterol efflux, peptide binding to ABCA1-expressing cells, and peptide cross-linking to ABCA1, indicating that these processes require an active JAK2. In contrast, apoA-I and peptides stabilized ABCA1 protein even in the absence of an active JAK2, implying that this process is independent of JAK2 and lipid efflux-promoting binding of amphipathic helices to ABCA1. These findings show that amphipathic helices coordinate the activity of ABCA1 by several distinct mechanisms that are likely to involve different cell surface binding sites.
LRAT (lecithin:retinol acyltransferase), an enzyme whose levels are modulated during malignant conversion, has been reported as the founder member of a new LRAT-like family that includes tumor suppressors TIG-3(1-164) and Ha-Rev107(1-162). The mechanisms that link these three proteins to carcinogenesis as well as the significance of a reported shared sequence homologous region remain unclear. This begs the question if the tumor suppressors possess enzyme properties and/or if the LRAT enzyme possesses tumor suppressor properties. We use the reported homologous region as a first approach to address the question from the perspective that all three proteins can possess tumor suppressor properties. We postulated that the homologous sequence harbors an anti-proliferation domain within the full-length proteins and that dodecapeptides of this sequence possess anti-proliferative activity. We report that H-TIG-3(111-123), H-Ha-Rev107-1(111-123) and H-LRAT160-171:C168L exhibited in vitro growth inhibitory activity in a human cutaneous melanoma (HCM) model and affected tumor growth in a nude mouse model. Further, in peptide-sensitive HCM cells, these peptides crossed the plasma membrane and localized to the nucleus, where they could bind and activate promoters of transcription factors involved in G1-->S transition. Moreover, peptide-induced abrogation of cyclin dependent kinase-2 expression was concomitant with sub-cellular re-distribution of cyclins E and A. Indeed, the sequence homologous region within each full-length wild-type protein as well as the growth inhibitory peptides can form alpha helices, a likely configuration for binding to DNA. This is the first report that this sequence homologous region (AA111-123) within these LRAT-like proteins harbors an anti-proliferative domain with DNA binding properties. Sequences from this sequence homologous region can be used as templates for anti-tumor drug design and as probes to investigate disease-related mechanisms and structure-activity relationships of the full-length proteins, TIG-3(1-164), Ha-Rev107(1-162) and LRAT160-171.
CYP2E1 and GSTP1 enzymes belong to phase I and phase II group of drug metabolizing enzymes respectively which are involved in the metabolic activation and detoxification of various potential genotoxic compounds. The functional polymorphism in these genes exhibit inter-individual variations in susceptibility towards various diseases and difference in therapeutic response. The variant sequences of these genes differ considerably between ethnic groups. Therefore, the objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of CYP2E1 & GSTP1 gene variants in healthy volunteers of Tamilnadu, a population of South India. The genotype distribution of CYP2E1*1B A2A2, A2A1 and A1A1 were 61%, 36% and 3% respectively. The distribution of CYP2E1*5B c1c1, c1c2 genotypes were 99.2%and 0.8%. CYP2E1*6 DD, DC and CC genotype frequencies were 72%, 25% and 3% respectively. The allele frequencies of CYP2E1*1B, CYP2E1*5B and CYP2E1*6 were A2- 0.79 A1- 0.21, c1-0.996 c2 - 0.004 and D- 0.84 C- 0.16 respectively. The genotypic distribution of GSTP1 (Ile/Val) were Ile/Ile - 44%, Ile/Val -47% and Val/Val- 9 % whereas, the allelic frequencies were 0.67 for Ile and 0.33 for Val allele. The molecular studies in these enzymes provide basis for further epidemiological investigations in the population where the functional mutations in the genes alter therapeutic response and acts as susceptibility markers for various clinical conditions.
CYP2D6 is one of the most polymorphic of the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Genetic differences in this enzyme have been reported in whites, blacks, and Asians. However, there is very little information about polymorphisms of this enzyme in Mexican Americans. The objectives of the present study were to assess the metabolic activity of CYP2D6 in a Mexican American population using dextromethorphan and to correlate this metabolic activity with a genotypic analysis. The sample consisted of 50 Mexican American subjects and 25 non-Mexican American controls. Overnight urine samples were collected and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography to calculate the metabolic ratio of dextromethorphan to dextrorphan. Blood samples were collected for genotypic analysis of CYP2D6 alleles. The frequency of the poor metabolizer phenotype was the same in the Mexican American group and the non-Mexican American group (6% vs 5.5%). The frequency of alleles in the Mexican American group was similar to frequencies published in other reports for non-Hispanic whites: *4 = 0.17, *5 = 0.02, *10 = 0.01, *17 = 0.02, *xN = 0.03. These results indicate that compared with non-Hispanic whites, Mexican Americans have a similar proportion of poor metabolizer phenotype and similar genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6.
MPI quality relies on the sophisticated algorithms that drive patient lookup. As health information exchange gains momentum, accurate and complete record matching will be more critical than ever.
CYP3A5 and MDR1 polymorphisms have been shown to influence tacrolimus blood concentrations and dose requirements. The aim is to determine whether these polymorphisms also affect sirolimus trough concentrations and dose requirements after kidney transplantation.
ACE inhibitors have significantly decreased cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and hospitalizations for heart failure (HF) in patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Furthermore, the extended 12-year study of the SOLVD (Studies Of Left Ventricular Dysfunction) Prevention and Treatment trials (X-SOLVD) demonstrated a significant benefit with a reduction of cumulative all-cause death compared with placebo (50.9% vs 56.4%) [hazard ratio (HR) 0.86; 95% CI 0.79, 0.93; p < 0.001]. The survival benefits and significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity related to treatment with ACE inhibitors are likely achieved by titrating the dose of ACE inhibitors to the target dose achieved in clinical trials. Although the ATLAS (Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril And Survival) study, which randomly allocated HF patients to low- or high-dose lisinopril, showed no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome of all-cause mortality (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.82, 1.03), the predetermined secondary combined outcome of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization was reduced by 15% for the patients receiving high-dose lisinopril compared with low-dose (p < 0.001) with a 24% reduction in HF hospitalization (p = 0.002). Despite the use of ACE inhibitors, blockade of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) remains incomplete, with evidence of continued production of angiotensin II by non-ACE-dependent pathways. The safety and potential benefits of angiotensin receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) in patients with impaired systolic function have been assessed in moderate to large clinical trials. In patients with impaired LV systolic function and HF, combination therapy with ARBs with recommended HF therapy including ACE inhibitors in patients who remain symptomatic may be considered for its morbidity benefit. Based on the CHARM (Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity)-Added data, candesartan cilexetil in addition to standard HF therapy results in a further reduction of cardiovascular mortality. Close monitoring of renal function and serum potassium levels is needed in this setting. The VALIANT (VALsartan In Acute myocardial iNfarction Trial) results suggest that valsartan is as effective as captopril in patients following an acute MI with HF and/or LV systolic dysfunction and may be used as an alternative treatment in ACE inhibitor-intolerant patients. There was no survival benefit with valsartan-captopril combination compared with captopril alone in this trial. Despite these results, ACE inhibitors remain the first-choice therapeutic agent in post-MI patients, and ARBs can be used in patients with clear intolerance. Although the use of ACE inhibitors may be appealing in patients with HF and preserved LV systolic function, there is currently no evidence from large clinical trials to support this.
ASL enables noninvasive, quantitative monitoring of cerebral perfusion to be performed repeatedly over a period of hours. Thus, ASL is an attractive method for basic science studies of the time evolution and pathophysiology of diseases using animal models. In particular, ASL is valuable for basic science studies of evolving tissue status and viability in stroke using animal models of acute ischemia. This study describes both pulsed (PASL) and continuous ASL (CASL) studies of quantitative cerebral perfusion in rodent models of cerebral ischemia. Some technical factors pertinent to these studies are discussed, including a method for measuring arterial blood T(1) and double-echo PASL for measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) and volume (CBV). Investigations of the CBF response to forebrain ischemia and reperfusion, and of regional variations in CBF and arterial transit time (ATT) are also discussed.
GPAM maps in BTA26q22, where several QTLs affecting milk production, milk fat and protein content have been mapped. On the basis of the QTL location, the GPAM gene could be considered a good candidate gene for the mentioned traits. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase mitochondrial (GPAM) is the enzyme that catalyses the initial and committed step of glycerolipid synthesis and, therefore, it is a potential site for triacylglycerol synthesis regulation. In this study, the structure of the cDNA and the genomic DNA of the bovine GPAM gene were determined and the expression of its mRNA was studied. The cDNA of the gene was cloned by RT-PCR, 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The GPAM mRNA sequence contains a 2,475-bp coding region and a 3,689-bp 3' UTR. Its ORF encoded for an 825-amino acid protein and has an 89% homology with the coding regions of previously characterized mouse and human GPAM genes. The predicted amino acid sequence had an 89 and 93% similarity with mouse and human GPAM proteins, respectively. Using a 5' RACE strategy, two different 5' UTRs were cloned. Northern blot analysis confirmed the presence of two different transcripts. Adipose tissues and lung had the highest levels of GPAM mRNA expression, whereas it was barely detectable in liver. This expression pattern differs with those of non-ruminant animals where liver is one of the tissues with higher GPAM mRNA expression level.
CP titanium was polished with a colloidal silica suspension and chromic oxide slurry under low and high pressures. The polished surfaces were characterized by means of EPMA and XPS. Irrespective of polishing pressure, colloidal silica suspension successfully created a mirror-like surface that was clean at EPMA level. However, XPS detected a small amount of silicon on the outermost surface. On the other hand, chromic oxide slurry under high pressure yielded a very uneven surface with numerous scratches. The EPMA and XPS results suggested the presence of chromium-containing species in the polished surface, which might include hydroxides as well as oxides. In addition, the level of oxygen concentration was noticeably raised, which probably resulted from the increase of surface oxide film thickness or the extension of oxide-to-metal transition zone.
PTEN is involved in the regulation of normal cellular functions in addition to its well-known role as a tumor suppressor. In the present study, we have shown that stable transfection of the PTEN gene into PTEN-mutated endometrial carcinoma cells leads to contact inhibition accompanied by a decreased level of phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt) expression, an increase in p27(Kip1), and a decrease in beta-catenin. PTEN-induced cells with contact inhibition exhibit G0-G1 cell-cycle arrest, and the Ki-67 labeling index is reduced. These changes are canceled by transfection of a double-stranded short-interfering RNA against the PTEN gene. Normal endometrial stromal cells increase their PTEN expression when reaching confluence; this is followed by changes in the expression of Akt-related proteins in the same way as in tumor cells. These results indicate that PTEN, p-Akt, p27, and beta-catenin are involved in the signal transduction of contact inhibition and suggest that PTEN may, in part, control the proliferation of endometrial carcinoma cells through the induction of contact inhibition.
CD38 expression on CD8(+) T cells was longitudinally assessed in 31 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons with undetectable plasma viremia who had undergone highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for 12 months and were followed for a mean of 30 months thereafter. Overall, CD4(+)T cell counts increased during follow-up, whereas CD38 expression remained stable. However, a subset of patients showed declines in CD38 expression, and, conversely, another subset showed increases in CD38 expression. No association could be found between long-term gains in CD4(+) T cells and evolution of CD38 expression. Thus, activation of CD8(+) T cells does not seem to be associated with the extent of CD4(+) T cell recovery beyond the first year of successful HAART.
SOD1 has to undergo several post-translational modifications before reaching its mature form. The protein requires insertion of zinc and copper atoms, followed by the formation of a conserved S-S bond between Cys-57 and Cys-146 (human numbering), which makes the protein fully active. In this report an NMR structural investigation of the reduced SH-SH form of thermostable E,Zn-as-SOD1 (E is empty; as is C6A, C111S) is reported, characterizing the protein just before the last step leading to the mature form. The structure is compared with that of the oxidized S-S form as well as with that of the yeast SOD1 complexed with its copper chaperone, CCS. Local conformational rearrangements upon disulfide bridge reduction are localized in the region near Cys-57 that is completely exposed to the solvent in the present structure, at variance with the oxidized forms. There is a local disorder around Cys-57 that may serve for protein-protein recognition and may possibly be involved in intermolecular S-S bonds in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-related SOD1 mutants. The structure allows us to further discuss the copper loading mechanism in SOD1.
CYP2C19 is a clinically important enzyme involved in the metabolism of therapeutic drugs such as (S)-mephenytoin, omeprazole, proguanil, and diazepam. Individuals can be characterized as either extensive metabolizers (EM) or poor metabolizers (PM) on the basis of CYP2C19 enzyme activity. The PM phenotype occurs in 2-5% of Caucasian populations, but at higher frequencies (18-23%) in Asians. CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3, which are single-nucleotide polymorphisms of CYP2C19, are the main cause of PM phenotyping in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes. We report two novel mutations in the CYP2C19 gene identified by direct sequencing and subcloning procedures. One of these mutations was considered to be CYP2C19*3 by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). This result suggests that mutations classed as CYP2C19*3 might include other mutations. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between these novel mutations and enzyme activity.
CYP2B6 is a drug-metabolizing enzyme expressed in human tissues that can activate bupropion (a smoking cessation drug) and tobacco smoke nitrosamines and can inactivate drugs such as nicotine. Smokers have higher brain CYP2B6 protein levels compared to non-smokers but the cause of this elevation is unknown. We investigated the basal expression and the effect of chronic nicotine treatment on CYP2B6 protein in African Green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) brain. Basal expression of brain CYP2B6 was strong in specific cells such as the frontal cortical pyramidal cells, the cerebellar Purkinje cells and the neurons in the substantia nigra. Basal CYP2B6 protein levels varied 2.7-fold (non-significant) among 12 brain regions. All monkeys were given a subcutaneous 0.1 mg/kg nicotine test dose prior to treatment and the maximum plasma concentration achieved was 87 +/- 69 ng/ml and the half-life was 2.6 +/- 1.5 h. Monkeys were treated subcutaneously twice daily with nicotine at 0.05 mg/kg for 2 days, 0.15 mg/kg for 2 days followed by 0.3 mg/kg for 18 days (n = 6) or saline (n = 6). Chronic nicotine treatment induced CYP2B6 expression in specific cells such as astrocytes and neurons in the frontal cortex, caudate, thalamus and hippocampus. CYP2B6 protein levels were induced 1.5-fold in the frontal cortex (p < 0.01). Hepatic CYP2B6 expression was not altered by nicotine. In conclusion, CYP2B6 protein is expressed in specific cells in monkey brain and is induced by chronic nicotine treatment which may impact central metabolism of CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion and nicotine.
CHAT (Choosing Healthplans All Together) is an exercise in participatory decision making designed to engage the public in health care priority setting. Participants work individually and then in groups to distribute a limited number of pegs on a board as they select from a wide range of insurance options. Randomly distributed health events illustrate the consequences of insurance choices. In 1999-2000, the authors conducted fifty sessions of CHAT involving 592 residents of North Carolina. The exercise was rated highly regarding ease of use, informativeness, and enjoyment. Participants found the information believable and complete, thought the group decision-making process was fair, and were willing to abide by group decisions. CHAT holds promise as a tool to foster group deliberation, generate collective choices, and incorporate the preferences and values of consumers into allocation decisions. It can serve to inform and stimulate public dialogue about limited health care resources.
CD38 is a membrane-bound protein involved in the synthesis and degradation of cyclic-ADP-ribose (cADPR). cADPR mobilizes calcium from intracellular stores in airway smooth muscle cells. To determine the role of CD38/cADPR signaling in calcium regulation in human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells, we downregulated CD38 expression using a recombinant replication-defective adenovirus with anti-sense human CD38 (Ad-asCD38). CD38 expression was determined by RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR, and ADP-ribosyl cyclase (cyclase) activity was determined by competitive binding assay. In HASM cells infected with Ad-asCD38, TNF-alpha-induced, augmented-CD38 expression and cyclase activity were significantly lower than in TNF-alpha-treated cells. The net intracellular calcium responses to 10 nmol/L bradykinin were measured in HASM cells by fluorescence imaging. In cells infected with Ad-asCD38 in the presence of TNF-alpha, the net intracellular Ca2+ responses were significantly lower than in cells treated with TNF-alpha in the presence of the control vector (p < 0.001). These results provide evidence for the feasibility of using adenoviral vectors for gene transfer to down regulate gene expression, and confirm the role of CD38 in calcium homeostatis in ASM cells.
MPI encodes phosphomannose isomerase, which interconverts fructose 6-phosphate and mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P), used for glycoconjugate biosynthesis. MPI mutations in humans impair protein glycosylation causing congenital disorder of glycosylation Ib (CDG-Ib), but oral mannose supplements normalize glycosylation. To establish a mannose-responsive mouse model for CDG-Ib, we ablated Mpi and provided dams with mannose to rescue the anticipated defective glycosylation. Surprisingly, although glycosylation was normal, Mpi(-/-) embryos died around E11.5. Mannose supplementation even hastened their death, suggesting that man-nose was toxic. Mpi(-/-) embryos showed growth retardation and placental hyperplasia. More than 90% of Mpi(-/-) embryos failed to form yolk sac vasculature, and 35% failed chorioallantoic fusion. We generated primary embryonic fibroblasts to investigate the mechanisms leading to embryonic lethality and found that mannose caused a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of Man 6-P in Mpi(-/-) fibroblasts. In parallel, ATP decreased by more than 70% after 24 h compared with Mpi(+/+) controls. In cell lysates, Man-6-P inhibited hexokinase (70%), phosphoglucose isomerase (65%), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (85%), but not phosphofructokinase. Incubating intact Mpi(-/-) fibroblasts with 2-[(3)H]deoxyglucose confirmed mannose-dependent hexokinase inhibition. Our results in vitro suggest that mannose toxicity in Mpi(-/-) embryos is caused by Man-6-P accumulation, which inhibits glucose metabolism and depletes intracellular ATP. This was confirmed in E10.5 Mpi(-/-) embryos where Man-6-P increased more than 10 times, and ATP decreased by 50% compared with Mpi(+/+) littermates. Because Mpi ablation is embryonic lethal, a murine CDG-Ib model will require hypomorphic Mpi alleles.
SLC26A7 is a newly identified basolateral Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger specific to alpha-intercalated cells of the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD). The purpose of the present experiments was to examine the expression of SLC26A7 in kidneys of vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro rats before and after treatment with desamino-Cys(1),d-Arg(8)-vasopressin (dDAVP). Brattleboro rats were treated with dDAVP, a vasopressin analog, for 8 days, and their kidneys were examined for the expression of SLC26A7. The expression of SLC26A7 protein, as examined by immunofluorescence, was undetectable in kidneys of Brattleboro rats. However, treatment with dDAVP induced expression of SLC26A7 protein, restoring it to levels observed in normal rats. These results were verified by Western blot analysis. The mRNA expression of SLC26A7 remained unchanged in response to dDAVP. Immunofluorescent labeling demonstrated abundant levels of anion exchanger type 1 in the OMCD of Brattleboro rats and a mild reduction in response to dDAVP. The abundance of H(+)-ATPase was not affected by dDAVP. The increased SLC26A7 expression directly correlated with enhanced aquaporin-2 expression, which is proportional to increased interstitial osmolarity in the medulla. In conclusion, vasopressin increases the expression of SLC26A7 protein through posttranscriptional mechanisms in the OMCD. The induction of SLC26A7 by vasopressin in OMCD cells of Brattleboro rats is likely an attempt by cells to regulate their cell volume and maintain HCO(3)(-) absorption in a state associated with increased interstitial medullary tonicity.
WWOX is a tumour suppressor gene involved in various tumours including breast cancer. High chromosomal abnormalities in a genomic region spanned by WWOX are associated with the fact that this gene covers approximately 1 million base pairs of the second most affected among common chromosomal fragile sites FRA16D. We evaluated WWOX expression levels in breast cancer samples in association with diagnostics-prognostics markers.
CYP2D6 is a highly polymorphic enzyme that mediates the metabolism of around 20% of all currently prescribed drugs. Genetic variability within CYP2D6 results in poor (PM), intermediate (IM), extensive (EM) and ultra-rapid metabolisers (UM) of CYP2D6 substrates. Here we describe an assay which is able to detect the major PM (CYP2D6*3, *4, *5, *6), IM (CYP2D6*9, *10, *41) and UM (CYP2D6*nxn) alleles found in Caucasians. This assay is performed in two stages. The first stage is a multiplex long-range PCR which is used to simultaneously screen for whole gene deletions and duplications while isolating CYP2D6 from the CYP2D gene cluster to avoid pseudogene contamination. In the second stage, individuals with one or more copies of CYP2D6 are genotyped for PM and IM alleles using a two-tube multiplex Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS). The specificity and reliability of the multiplex long-range PCR and subsequent ARMS were confirmed using a panel of positive controls that had been previously validated by PCR-RFLPs and DNA sequencing. This two-stage assay offers a robust and cheap alternative to many currently available CYP2D6 genotyping approaches. Our entire assay, once patient DNA has been extracted, can be run within 7 h using 10 microl PCRs.
CYP2E1 is expressed in liver and extrahepatic tissues, including brain. It metabolizes ethanol and other drugs and toxins, such as acetaminophen, chlorzoxazone and tobacco-derived nitrosamines. Hepatic CYP2E1 is inducible by nicotine, and cigarette smoke accelerates chlorzoxazone metabolism. Smokers have higher levels of brain CYP2E1 expression than non-smokers, but the specific regions and cell types which have the higher expression differ from nicotine-induced rat brain. We therefore investigated the expression and distribution of brain CYP2E1 in a non-human primate, the African green monkey, and determined the effect of nicotine treatment. CYP2E1 levels varied among saline-treated monkey brain regions (P < 0.01) and expression was cell-type specific. Chronic nicotine treatment induced CYP2E1 expression in the frontal cortex (1.5-fold, P < 0.05) and cerebellum (1.5-fold, P < 0.01), specifically in cortical pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells but no change was seen in temporal cortex (P = 0.20), hippocampus (P = 0.29), putamen (P = 0.26) and thalamus (P = 0.08). CYP2E1 expression pattern in monkey brain following chronic nicotine treatment is similar to that in smokers, suggesting that nicotine may be the primary component in cigarette smoke that induces CYP2E1. Increased CYP2E1 in brain may contribute to oxidative stress and alter localized metabolism, and resulting pharmacology, of centrally acting drugs metabolized by CYP2E1.
CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 metabolically activate many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including benzo[a]pyrene, to reactive intermediates associated with toxicity, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis. Paradoxically, however, Cyp1a1-/- knockout mice are more sensitive to oral benzo[a]pyrene exposure, compared with wild-type Cyp1a1+/+ mice (Mol Pharmacol 65:1225, 2004). To further investigate the mechanism for this enhanced sensitivity, Cyp1a1-/-, Cyp1a2-/-, and Cyp1b1-/- single-knockout, Cyp1a1/1b1-/- and Cyp1a2/1b1-/- double-knockout, and Cyp1+/+ wild-type mice were analyzed. After administration of oral benzo[a]pyrene (125 mg/kg/day) for 18 days, Cyp1a1-/- mice showed marked wasting, immunosuppression, and bone marrow hypocellularity, whereas the other five genotypes did not. After 5 days of feeding, steady-state blood levels of benzo[a]pyrene were approximately 25 and approximately 75 times higher in Cyp1a1-/- and Cyp1a1/1b1-/- mice, respectively, than in wild-type mice. Benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adduct levels were highest in liver, spleen, and marrow of Cyp1a1-/- and Cyp1a1/1b1-/- mice. Many lines of convergent data obtained with oral benzo[a]pyrene dosing suggest that: 1) inducible CYP1A1, probably in both intestine and liver, is most important in detoxication; 2) CYP1B1 in spleen and marrow is responsible for metabolic activation of benzo[a]pyrene, which results in immune damage in the absence of CYP1A1; 3) both thymus atrophy and hepatocyte hypertrophy are independent of CYP1B1 metabolism but rather may reflect long-term activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor; and 4) the magnitude of immune damage in Cyp1a1-/- and Cyp1a1/1b1-/- mice is independent of plasma benzo[a]pyrene and total-body burden and clearance. Thus, a balance between tissue-specific expression of the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 enzymes governs sensitivity of benzo[a]pyrene toxicity and, possibly, carcinogenicity.
CLC Cl- channels are homodimers in which each subunit has a proper pore and a (fast) gate. An additional slow gate acts on both pores. A conserved glutamate (E166 in CLC-0) is a major determinant of gating in CLC-0 and is crucially involved in Cl-/H+ antiport of CLC-ec1, a CLC of known structure. We constructed tandem dimers with one wild-type (WT) and one mutant subunit (E166A or E166D) to show that these mutations of E166 specifically alter the fast gate of the pore to which they belong without effect on the fast gate of the neighboring pore. In addition both mutations activate the common slow gate. E166A pores have a large, voltage-independent open probability of the fast gate (popen), whereas popen of E166D pores is dramatically reduced. Similar to WT, popen of E166D was increased by lowering pHint. At negative voltages, E166D presents a persistent inward current that is blocked by p-chlorophenoxy-acetic acid (CPA) and increased at low pHext. The pHext dependence of the persistent current is analogous to a similar steady inward current in WT CLC-0. Surprisingly, however, the underlying unitary conductance of the persistent current in E166D is about an order of magnitude smaller than that of the transient deactivating inward Cl- current. Collectively, our data support the possibility that the mutated CLC-0 channel E166D can assume two distinct open states. Voltage-independent protonation of D166 from the outside favors a low conductance state, whereas protonation from the inside favors the high conductance state.
CAD (Cath.a-differentiated) cells, a mouse neuronal cell line, were subjected to electrohydrodynamic jetting at a field strength of 0.47-0.67 kV/mm, corresponding to an applied voltage of 7-10 kV. After jetting, the cells appeared normal and continued to divide at rates similar to those shown by control samples. Jetted cells, when placed in serum-free medium, underwent differentiation that was sustained for at least 1 month. Some of the droplets produced by jetting contained only a few cells. These results indicate that the process of jetting does not significantly perturb neuronal cells and that this novel approach might in the future be a useful way to deposit small numbers of living nerve cells on to surfaces.
SULT2A1 is a sulfo-conjugating phase II enzyme expressed at very high levels in the liver and intestine, the two major first-pass metabolic tissues, and in the steroidogenic adrenal tissue. SULT2A1 acts preferentially on the hydroxysteroids dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone/dihydrotestosterone, and pregnenolone and on cholesterol-derived amphipathic sterol bile acids. Several therapeutic drugs and other xenobiotics, which include xenoestrogens, are also sulfonated by this cytosolic steroid/bile acid sulfotransferase. Nonsteroid nuclear receptors with key roles in the metabolism and detoxification of endobiotics and xenobiotics, such as bile acid-activated farnesoid X receptor, xenobiotic-activated pregnane X receptor and constitutive androstane receptor, and lipid-activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, mediate transcription induction of SULT2A1 in the enterohepatic system. The ligand-activated vitamin D receptor (VDR) is another nuclear receptor that stimulates SULT2A1 transcription, and the regulatory elements in human, mouse, and rat promoters directing this induction have been characterized. Given that bile acid sulfonation is catalyzed exclusively by SULT2A1 and that the 3alpha-sulfate of the highly toxic lithocholic acid is a major excretory metabolite in humans, we speculate that a role for the VDR pathway in SULT2A1 expression may have emerged to shield first-pass tissues from the cytotoxic effects of a bile acid overload arising from disrupted sterol homeostasis triggered by endogenous and exogenous factors.
CYP2A6 is the main enzyme that catalyzes nicotine into cotinine. Interindividual differences in nicotine metabolism result at least partially from polymorphic variation of CYP2A6 gene. In this study, we evaluated the influence of CYP2A6 polymorphisms on clinical phenotypes of smoking, such as smoking habit and withdrawal symptoms. Japanese smokers (n = 107) were genotyped for CYP2A6*1, *4 and *9. Consistent with the previous reports, CYP2A6 genotypes have a tendency to correlate with the number of cigarettes per day and with daily intake of nicotine. Interestingly, CYP2A6 high-activity group (CYP2A6*1/*1, *1/*9, *1/*4, *9/*9) smoked the first cigarette of the day earlier than low-activity group (CYP2A6*4/*9, *4/*4), indicating more remarkable nicotine dependence. Furthermore, nicotine withdrawal symptoms were more serious in smoking cessation in CYP2A6 high-activity group. Collectively, CYP2A6 genotypes are related with nicotine dependence, influencing smoking habits and withdrawal symptoms in quitting smoking. It is proposed that individualized smoking cessation program could be designed based on CYP2A6 genotypes.
PTEN is frequently inactivated during the development of many cancers, including prostate cancer, and both bi-allelic and mono-allelic PTEN inactivation may contribute to tumorigenesis. PTEN mutations in clinical cancer specimens can easily be recorded but mono- or bi-allelic gene deletions are often difficult to assess. We performed a comprehensive study to detect PTEN inactivation in 40 locally progressive clinical prostate cancer specimens obtained by transurethral resection of the prostate, utilizing a variety of complementary technical approaches. The methods to detect PTEN deletion included allelotype analysis, dual-colour FISH and array-based CGH. We also applied a novel semi-quantitative approach, assessing the PTEN-WT (wild-type): PTEN-Psi (pseudogene) ratio (WPR). Structural analysis of PTEN was performed by single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and sequencing. PTEN protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Our data predict complete PTEN inactivation in 12 samples (30%), nine of these by bi-allelic deletion. Loss of one PTEN copy was also detected by several methodologies but the number could not be accurately assessed. Immunohistochemistry indicated the absence of PTEN protein in 15 samples, and heterogeneous expression of the protein in eight tumours. Taken together, these data show that bi-allelic deletion is a major mechanism of PTEN inactivation in locally progressive prostate cancer.
CAD systems, developed to assist the radiologist in the detection of suspicious lesions on mammograms, are currently controversially discussed. The highly sensitive detection of malignant structures including priors by CAD is linked with a low specific performance and a high rate of falsely positive markings. This causes controversial results regarding the effect of CAD systems for the diagnosing radiologist. This review aims to give an overview of the current literature, to state the currently discussed controversial results of CAD and to give an outlook on the next developments, which are not limited to senology, but include many other applications of CAD systems in radiology.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue, deleted on chromosome 10) is a tumor suppressor with dual phosphatase activity and mutations of its gene, PTEN, have been associated with many sporadic cancers and heritable neoplasia syndromes, including Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. However, accumulating evidence now shows that PTEN may have novel functions other than as a phosphatase. In the present study, we show that PTEN is able to autoregulate its expression through the stabilization of another tumor suppressor p53. We further show that PTEN enhances p53 transactivation, a relationship that requires the interaction between PTEN and p53 and is PTEN phosphatase independent. We show that cell lines from Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome patients with germ line PTEN promoter mutations in the vicinity of the p53-binding motifs have altered p53 regulation. This seems to be due to reduced PTEN stability and decreased PTEN-p53 interactions. Our data provide clues to better understand the regulation of PTEN expression and the possible mechanisms of the pathogenesis of the subset of Cowden syndrome individuals with germ line promoter variation and who lack mutations in the PTEN coding region and splice sites. Importantly, this mechanism also holds for those sporadic tumors that lack intragenic mutations but have hemizygous deletion of PTEN, which includes the promoter region as manifested by loss-of-heterozygosity of 10q markers. The importance of our observations is underlined by the broad spectrum of neoplasias that harbor somatic PTEN or p53 alterations, or both.
UGT1A1 is induced by phenobarbital. We investigated whether three common UGT1A1 variants are associated with the variability in UGT1A1 inducibility. Human hepatocytes were incubated with 2 mM phenobarbital for 2 and 6 days followed by 5 microM SN-38 (1 h), a UGT1A1 probe. SN-38 glucuronidation in the cell media was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Three UGT1A1 promoter variants [-53(TA)(6>7), -3156G > A and -3279T > G] were genotyped. Significant induction of UGT1A1 catalytic activity was observed in 82% and 100% of the cultures treated with phenobarbital for 2 days (median fold-induction = 1.6, range 1.3-2.8; n = 28) and 6 days (median fold-induction = 2.8, range 1.6-6.4; n = 16), respectively. After 2 days of treatment, a negative correlation was observed between the UGT1A1 basal activities and the fold-induction (Spearman r = -0.52, P < 0.005). By contrast, the UGT1A1 activities in the basal and induced states were highly correlated (Spearman r = 0.95, P < 0.0001). Similar results were observed after 6 days of treatment. The allele frequencies were not significantly different between induced (n = 22) and non-induced preparations (n = 6) (P > 0.05). The fold-induction was not associated with any variants (P > 0.05). The basal and induced activities were correlated with -53(TA)(6>7) (and with -3156G > A due to almost complete linkage with the -53 indel) (P = 0.001). No association was found with the -3279T > G single nucleotide polymorphism (P > 0.05). The indel at -53 affects the basal phenotype and appears to limit the hepatocyte capability of maximal induction after phenobarbital. However, variants at -53, -3156 and -3279 are not associated with variability in UGT1A1 inducibility.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is a potent tumor suppressor gene frequently mutated in human prostate cancers. Deletion of Pten in a murine model of prostate cancer recapitulates the disease progression seen in humans. Using defined cell lineage markers, we demonstrate that PTEN negatively regulates p63-positive prostatic basal cell proliferation without blocking differentiation. Concomitant with basal cell proliferation is the expansion of a prostate stem/progenitor-like subpopulation as evidenced by the progressive increase of stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1)- and BCL-2-positive cells. This observation provides strong evidence that basal cell proliferation can be an initiating event for precancerous lesions. Sca-1(+) and BCL-2(+) progenitors may serve as cancer-initiating cells in this model.
ABCG5 and ABCG8 are two ATP-binding cassette half-transporters that belong to the G family members. They were identified as proteins that are mutated in a rare human disorder, sitosterolemia, and their identification led to the completion of the physiological pathways by which dietary cholesterol, as well as noncholesterol sterols, traffics in the mammalian body. These proteins are likely to function as heterodimers, and current evidence suggests that these proteins are responsible for the majority of sterol secretions into bile, thus may define the long sought-after biliary sterol transporters. This review will focus on some of the backgrounds of this physiology, the genetics and regulation of these genes, as well as our current understanding of their functions. This review will also highlight the current limitations in our knowledge gap.
CD38 has multiple roles in biology, including T lymphocyte signaling, neutrophil migration, neurotransmission, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and bone remodeling. To study the transcriptional control of the CD38 gene, we cloned a putative 1.8 kb promoter fragment from a rabbit genomic DNA library. Primer extension analysis indicated two transcription start sites consistent with the absence of a TATA box. Sequence analysis revealed several AP-1, AP-4, myo-D, GATA, and SP-1 sequences. MC3T3.E1 (osteoblast) or RAW-C3 (osteoclast precursor macrophage) cells were then transfected with the CD38 promoter or its deletion fragments ligated to the luciferase reporter gene. Except for the shortest 41 bp fragment, all fragments showed significant luciferase activity. There was a marked stimulation of basal activity in the 93 bp fragment that contained a GC box and SP-1 site. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the activity of the fragments in MC3T3.E1 and RAW-C3 cells. Intracellular Ca(2+) elevations by ionomycin (10muM) in MC3T3.E1 cells inhibited promoter activity, except in the short 41 bp. In contrast, cAMP elevation by exposure to forskolin (100 microM) inhibited activation of all fragments, except the 0.6 and 1.2kb fragments. Finally, TNF-alpha stimulated promoter activity in RAW-C3 cells transfected with the 93 bp and 1.0 kb fragments, consistent with the stimulation of CD38 mRNA by TNF-alpha. Physiologically, therefore, modulation of the expression of the NAD(+)-sensing enzyme, CD38, by Ca(2+), cAMP, and cytokines, such as TNF-alpha may contribute to coupling the intense metabolic activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts to their respective bone-resorbing and bone-forming functions.
CS mice show unique properties of circadian rhythms: unstable free-running periods and distinct bimodal rhythms (similar to rhythm splitting, but hereafter referred to as bimodal rhythms) under constant darkness. In the present study, we compared clock-related gene expression (mPer1, mBmal1 and Dbp) in the SCN and peripheral tissues (liver, adrenal gland and heart) between CS and C57BL/6J mice. In spite of normal robust oscillation in the SCN of both mice, behavioral rhythms and peripheral rhythms of clock-related genes were significantly different between these mice. However, when daytime restricted feeding was given, no essential differences between the two strains were observed. These results indicate that unusual circadian behaviors and peripheral gene expression in CS mice do not depend on the SCN but rather mechanisms outside of the SCN.
ACE inhibition and/or blocking of the angiotensin II receptor are recognized as first-line treatment for nephropathy and cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients. However, little information is available about the potential benefits of these drugs on diabetic neuropathy. We examined vascular and neural activity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats that were treated for 12 weeks with enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, or L-158809, an angiotensin II receptor blocker. A prevention protocol (group 1) as well as three intervention protocols (treatment was initiated after 4, 8, or 12 weeks of diabetes [groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively]) were used. Endoneurial blood flow and motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) were impaired in all groups of untreated diabetic rats. In group 1, treatment of diabetic rats with enalapril or L-158809 partially prevented the diabetes-induced decrease in endoneurial blood flow and MNCV. In groups 2-4, intervention with enalapril was more effective in reversing the diabetes-induced impairment in endoneurial blood flow and MNCV than L-158809. The superoxide level in the aorta and epineurial arterioles of diabetic rats was increased. Treatment of diabetic rats with enalapril or L-158809 reduced the superoxide level in the aorta in all groups but was less effective in epineurial arterioles. Acetylcholine and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) cause vasodilation in epineurial arterioles of the sciatic nerve, which was impaired by diabetes. Treatment of diabetic rats (all groups) with enalapril or L-158809 completely prevented/reversed the diabetes-induced impairment in CGRP-mediated vascular relaxation. Treatment with enalapril or L-158809 was also effective in improving impaired acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation, but the efficacy was diminished from groups 1 to 4. These studies suggest that ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers may be effective treatments for diabetes and vascular and neural dysfunction. However, the efficacy of these treatments may be dependent on when the treatment is initiated.
PTEN tumor suppressor gene failure in ras(Ha)-activated skin carcinogenesis was investigated by mating exon 5 floxed-PTEN (Delta5PTEN) mice to HK1.ras mice that expressed a RU486-inducible cre recombinase (K14.creP). PTEN inactivation in K14.cre/PTEN(flx/flx) keratinocytes resulted in epidermal hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis and novel 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-promoted papillomas, whereas HK1.ras/K14.cre/PTEN(flx/flx) cohorts displayed a rapid onset of papillomatogenesis due to a synergism of increased AKT activity and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) elevation. High 5-bromo-4-deoxyuridine labeling in Delta5PTEN papillomas showed that a second promotion mechanism centered on failures in cell cycle control. Elevated cyclin D1 was associated with both HK1.ras/ERK- and Delta5PTEN-mediated AKT signaling, whereas cyclin E2 overexpression seemed dependent on PTEN loss. Spontaneous HK1.ras/Delta5PTEN malignant conversion was rare, whereas TPA promotion resulted in conversion with high frequency. On comparison with all previous HK1.ras carcinomas, such TPA-induced carcinomas expressed atypical retention of keratin K1 and lack of K13, a unique marker profile exhibited by TPA-induced K14.cre/PTEN(flx/flx) papillomas that also lacked endogenous c-ras(Ha) activation. Moreover, in all PTEN-null tumors, levels of ras(Ha)-associated total ERK protein became reduced, whereas phosphorylated ERK and cyclin D1 were lowered in late-stage papillomas returning to elevated levels, alongside increased cyclin E2 expression, in TPA-derived carcinomas. Thus, during early papillomatogenesis, PTEN loss promotes ras(Ha) initiation via elevation of AKT activity and synergistic failures in cyclin regulation. However, in progression, reduced ras(Ha)-associated ERK protein and activity, increased Delta5PTEN-associated cyclin E2 expression, and unique K1/K13 profiles following TPA treatment suggest that PTEN loss, rather than ras(Ha) activation, gives rise to a population of cells with greater malignant potential.
"AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 are human cytosolic hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, which play pivotal roles in the metabolism and action of natural and synthetic steroid hormones. The two enzymes are highly homologous, and have distinct positional and stereochemical preferences with various substrates. We performed molecular docking simulations of three steroid substrates, including an androgen (5alpha-dihydrotestosterone, DHT), a progestin (progesterone, PRO), and a synthetic hormone ([7alpha,17alpha]-17-hydroxy-7-methyl-19-norpregn-5(10)-en-20-yn-3-one or tibolone, TIB), into the active sites of the two enzymes. For each substrate and enzyme pair, the activity inferred by the ""productive"" docking models (in which the spatial arrangement of the steroid and the cofactor would permit a reaction) matched the experimentally observed positional and stereochemical outcome. These productive conformations were energetically and statistically favored except for TIB and PRO with AKR1C2, where experimentally strong substrate inhibition and low activity were observed, respectively. Results showed that (i) a 3-ketosteroid (DHT) and a 20-ketosteroid (PRO) were reduced by AKR1C1 since the carbonyl groups could occupy the same position by ""backwards"" binding of steroids; (ii) 3alpha-reduced (DHT) and 3beta-reduced (TIB) products were formed by AKR1C2 since the angular methyl groups of the steroids were inverted by ""upside-down"" binding of steroids; and (iii) the 3beta- and 3alpha-reduction of DHT by AKR1C1 and AKR1C2, respectively occurred since the steroids employed a ""swinging"" motion to present opposite faces to the cofactor. Favorable nonproductive modes were observed with all substrates in both enzymes in which the steroid was bound at a ""near-entry"" position and/or an ""in-middle"" position, which may influence the reaction coordinate."
CFTR exon 9 presents a 3' splice site polymorphism, (UG)mU(n), whose composition influences splicing. TDP43 specifically binds the UG tract of the transcript and inhibits splicing in vitro. We report that depletion of TDP43 through RNA interference removes splicing inhibition caused by unfavorable (UG)mU(n) sequences, indicating that TDP43 exerts a potent inhibitory effect in vivo. We also show that the UG-TDP43 interaction has a dominant role over other exon 9 splicing regulatory elements. These results suggest that TDP43 association near a splice site has determined the evolution of positive splicing regulatory elements to contrast this inhibition.
SLC26A6 is a recently identified apical Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger with strong expression in murine duodenum. The present study was designed to examine the role of SLC26A6 in prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2))-, forskolin-, and carbachol-induced duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion.
CYP2D6 polymorphisms are well described in normal populations but there are few data on its clinical significance. We therefore investigated the influence of CYP2D6 polymorphism on steady-state plasma concentrations and apparent oral clearance of metoprolol in patients with cardiovascular diseases.
PDE10A is a recently identified phosphodiesterase that is highly expressed by the GABAergic medium spiny projection neurons of the mammalian striatum. Inhibition of PDE10A results in striatal activation and behavioral suppression, suggesting that PDE10A inhibitors represent a novel class of antipsychotic agents. In the present studies we further elucidate the localization of this enzyme in striatum of rat and cynomolgus monkey. We find by confocal microscopy that PDE10A-like immunoreactivity is excluded from each class of striatal interneuron. Thus, the enzyme is restricted to the medium spiny neurons. Subcellular fractionation indicates that PDE10A is primarily membrane bound. The protein is present in the synaptosomal fraction but is separated from the postsynaptic density upon solubilization with 0.4% Triton X-100. Immuno-electron microscopy of striatum confirms that PDE10A is most often associated with membranes in dendrites and spines. Immuno-gold particles are observed on the edge of the postsynaptic density but not within this structure. Our studies indicate that PDE10A is associated with post-synaptic membranes of the medium spiny neurons, suggesting that the specialized compartmentation of PDE10A enables the regulation of intracellular signaling from glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs to these neurons.
CYP2D6 protein expression is determined by the number of functional CYP2D6 alleles. It is also higher in individuals with at least one CYP2D6*2 allele. This study has investigated the effect of the number of functional CYP2D6 alleles and the influence of CYP2D6*2 alleles on plasma perhexiline concentrations in patients administered a standard loading regimen over 3 days.
PTEN deficiency predisposes to a subset of human cancers, but the mechanism that underlies such selectivity is unknown. We have generated a mouse line that conditionally deletes Pten in urogenital epithelium. These mice develop carcinomas at high frequency in the prostate but at relatively low frequency in the bladder, despite early and complete penetrance of hyperplasia in both organs. Cell proliferation is initially high in the bladder of newborn Pten-deficient mice but within days is inhibited by p21 induction. In contrast, proliferation remains elevated in Pten-deficient prostate, where p21 is never induced, suggesting that p21 induction is a bladder-specific compensatory mechanism to inhibit proliferation caused by Pten deletion. Furthermore, the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin growth pathway, which is highly activated in Pten-deficient prostate, is not activated in bladder epithelium. Our results reveal alternative downstream signaling pathways activated by Pten deficiency that lead to tissue-specific susceptibilities to tumorigenesis.
ABCG2 is a member of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette family of multidrug transporters associated with resistance of tumor cells to many cytotoxic agents. Evaluation of modulators of ABCG2 activity has relied on methods such as drug sensitization, biochemical characterization, and transport studies. To search for novel inhibitors of ABCG2, a fluorescent cell-based assay was developed for application in high-throughput screening. Accumulation of pheophorbide a (PhA), an ABCG2-specific substrate, forms the basis for the assay in NCI-H460/MX20 cells overexpressing wild-type ABCG2. Treatment of these cells with 10 microM fumitremorgin C (FTC), a specific ABCG2 inhibitor, increased cell accumulation of PhA to 5.6 times control (Z' 0.5). Validation included confirmation with known ABCG2 inhibitors: FTC, novobiocin, tariquidar, and quercetin. Verapamil, reported to inhibit P-glycoprotein but not ABCG2, had insignificant activity. Screening of a library of 3523 natural products identified 11 compounds with high activity (> or = 50% of FTC, confirmed by reassay), including 3 flavonoids, members of a family of compounds that include ABCG2 inhibitors. One of the inhibitors detected, eupatin, was moderately potent (IC50 of 2.2 microM) and, like FTC, restored sensitivity of resistant cells to mitoxantrone. Application of this assay to other libraries of synthetic compounds and natural products is expected to identify novel inhibitors of ABCG2 activity.
CYP2E1 causes oxidative stress mediated cell death; the latter is one mechanism for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the cell. Unfolded proteins accumulate during ER stress and ER resident proteins GRP78 and GRP94 protect cells against ER dysfunction. We examined the possible role of GRP78 and GRP94 as protective factors against CYP2E1-mediated toxicity in HepG2 cells expressing CYP2E1 (E47 cells). E47 cells expressed high levels of CYP2E1 protein and catalytic activity which is associated with increased ROS generation, lipid peroxidation and the elevated presence of ubiquinated and aggregated proteins as compared to control HepG2 C34 cells which do not express CYP2E1. The mRNA and protein expression of GRP78 and GRP94 were decreased in E47 cells compared to the C34 cells, which may explain the accumulation of ubiquinated and aggregated proteins. Expression of these GRP proteins was induced with the ER stress agent thapsigargin in E47 cells, and E47 cells were more resistant to the toxicity caused by thapsigargin and calcimycin, possibly due to this upregulation and also because of the high expression of GSH and antioxidant enzymes in E47 cells. Antioxidants such as trolox and N-acetylcysteine increased GRP78 and GRP94 levels in the E47 cells, suggesting that CYP2E1- derived oxidant stress was responsible for down regulation of these GRPs in the E47 cells. Thapsigargin mediated toxicity was decreased in cells treated with the antioxidant trolox indicating a role for oxidative stress in this toxicity. These results suggest that CYP2E1 mediated oxidative stress downregulates the expression of GRP proteins in HepG2 cells and oxidative stress is an important mechanism in causing ER dysfunction in these cells.
AMT (ammonium transporter)/Rh (Rhesus) ammonium transporters/channels are identified in all domains of life and fulfil contrasting functions related either to ammonium acquisition or excretion. Based on functional and crystallographic high-resolution structural data, it was recently proposed that the bacterial AmtB (ammonium transporter B) is a gas channel for NH3 [Khademi, O'Connell, III, Remis, Robles-Colmenares, Miercke and Stroud (2004) Science 305, 1587-1594; Zheng, Kostrewa, Berneche, Winkler and Li (2004) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 101, 17090-17095]. Key residues, proposed to be crucial for NH3 conduction, and the hydrophobic, but obstructed, pore were conserved in a homology model of LeAMT1;1 from tomato. Transport by LeAMT1;1 was affected by mutations of residues that were predicted to constitute the aromatic recruitment site for NH4+ at the external pore entrance. Despite the structural similarities, LeAMT1;1 was shown to transport only the ion; each transported 14C-methylammonium molecule carried a single positive elementary charge. Similarly, NH4+ (or H+/NH3) was transported, but NH3 conduction was excluded. It is concluded that related proteins and a similar molecular architecture can apparently support contrasting transport mechanisms.
GAPDH (D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) is a multifunctional protein that is a target for the design of antitrypanosomatid and anti-apoptosis drugs. Here, the first high-resolution (1.75 Angstroms) structure of a human GAPDH is reported. The structure shows that the intersubunit selectivity cleft that has been leveraged in the design of antitrypanosomatid compounds is closed in human GAPDH. Modeling of an anti-trypanosomatid GAPDH inhibitor in the human GAPDH active site provides insights into the basis for the observed selectivity of this class of inhibitor. Moreover, the high-resolution data reveal a new feature of the cleft: water-mediated intersubunit hydrogen bonds that assist closure of the cleft in the human enzyme. The structure is used in a computational ligand-docking study of the small-molecule compound CGP-3466, which inhibits apoptosis by preventing nuclear accumulation of GAPDH. Plausible binding sites are identified in the adenosine pocket of the NAD(+)-binding site and in a hydrophobic channel located in the center of the tetramer near the intersection of the three molecular twofold axes. The structure is also used to build a qualitative model of the complex between GAPDH and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah1. The model suggests that the convex surface near GAPDH Lys227 interacts with a large shallow groove of the Siah1 dimer. These results are discussed in the context of the recently discovered NO-S-nitrosylation-GAPDH-Siah1 apoptosis cascade.
CD36 is a membrane glycoprotein involved in a variety of cellular processes such as lipid transport, immune regulation, hemostasis, adhesion, angiogenesis and atherosclerosis. It is expressed in many tissues and cell types, with a tissue specific expression pattern that is a result of a complex regulation for which the molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. There are several alternative mRNA isoforms described for the gene. We have investigated the expression patterns of five alternative first exons of the CD36 gene in several human tissues and cell types, to better understand the molecular details behind its regulation.
SLC26A7 is a Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger that is expressed on the basolateral membrane and in the cytoplasm of two distinct acid-secreting epithelial cells: The A-intercalated cells in the kidney outer medullary collecting duct and the gastric parietal cells. The intracellular localization of SLC26A7 suggests the possibility of trafficking between cell membrane and intracellular compartments. For testing this hypothesis, full-length human SLC26A7 cDNA was fused with green fluorescence protein and transiently expressed in MDCK epithelial cells. In monolayer cells in isotonic medium, SLC26A7 showed punctate distribution throughout the cytoplasm. However, in medium that was made hypertonic for 16 h, SLC26A7 was detected predominantly in the plasma membrane. The presence of mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors blocked the trafficking of SLC26A7 to the plasma membrane. Double-labeling studies demonstrated the localization of SLC26A7 to the transferrin receptor-positive endosomes. A chimera that was composed of the amino terminal fragment of SLC26A7 and the carboxyl terminal fragment of SLC26A1, and a C-terminal-truncated SLC26A7 were retained in the cytoplasm in hypertonicity. In separate studies, SLC26A7 showed predominant localization in plasma membrane in potassium-depleted isotonic medium (0.5 or 2 mEq/L KCl) versus cytoplasmic distribution in normal potassium isotonic medium (4 mEq/L). It is concluded that SLC26A7 is present in endosomes, and its targeting to the basolateral membrane is increased in hypertonicity and potassium depletion. The trafficking to the cell surface suggests novel functional upregulation of SLC26A7 in states that are associated with hypokalemia or increased medullary tonicity. Additional studies are needed to ascertain the role of SLC26A7 in enhanced bicarbonate absorption in outer medullary collecting duct in hypokalemia and in acid-base regulation in conditions that are associated with increased medullary tonicity.
PC cell-derived growth factor (PCDGF) is a crucial factor for regulating the growth and apoptosis of breast cancer cells; however the mechanism is unclear. This study was to construct a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting PCDGF, and analyze its effects on growth, proliferation, and apoptosis of MCF-7 cells and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are clinically important drug-metabolizing enzymes. The expression level of CYP2C9 is much higher than that of CYP2C19, although the factor(s) responsible for the difference between the expression levels of these genes is still unclear. It has been reported that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) plays an important role in regulation of the expression of liver-enriched genes, including P450 genes. Thus, we hypothesized that HNF4alpha contributes to the difference between the expression levels of these genes. Two direct repeat 1 (DR1) elements were located in both the CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 promoters. The upstream and downstream elements in these promoters had the same sequences, and HNF4alpha could bind to both elements in vitro. The transactivation levels of constructs containing two DR1 elements of the CYP2C9 promoter were increased by HNF4alpha, whereas those of the CYP2C19 promoter were not increased. The introduction of mutations into either the upstream or downstream element in the CYP2C9 gene abolished the responsiveness to HNF4alpha. We also examined whether HNF4alpha could bind to the promoter regions of the CYP2C9 and the CYP2C19 genes in vivo. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that HNF4alpha could bind to the promoter region of the CYP2C9 gene but not to that of the CYP2C19 promoter in the human liver. Taken together, our results suggest that HNF4alpha is a factor responsible for the difference between the expression levels of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 in the human liver.
PTEN (phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome 10) has been shown to be inactivated in a wide range of cancers and the role of this gene product is associated with the suppression of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in many cancers. Recently, some reports demonstrated that the degree of PTEN expression could predict trastuzumab chemosensitivity in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer. Here, we demonstrate the possible involvement of a proteasome inhibitor (PS341) in PTEN expression and elucidate the influence of PI3K/Akt, one of the main cascades of the ErbB2 downstream pathway, and discuss the role of the proteasome inhibitors in trastuzumab resistance. ErbB2-overexpressing SKBR3 human breast cancer cells and trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3/R cells were analyzed in this study. We show that the expression of phosphorylated Akt was highly increased in trastuzumab-resistant cells, although the expression of PI3K, phosphorylated PI3K and non-phosphorylated Akt was unchanged in comparison with wild-type SKBR3 cells. However, following treatment with PS341, the level of phosphorylated Akt was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, the level of PTEN was increased in the same fashion. PS341 showed sufficient cytotoxicity in resistant cells in combination with trastuzumab and the efficacy of trastuzumab was inclined to be better in resistant cells under PS341 treatment. Remarkable activity of Akt was observed in trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 breast cancer cells and this phenomenon could be associated with the decreased expression of PTEN. The proteasome inhibitor PS341 could increase the level of PTEN and inhibit the downstream pathway of ErbB2, interfering with phosphorylation of Akt.
CD36 has recently been shown to facilitate monocyte Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) recognition of lipoteichoic acid (LTA), much like CD14 in TLR4 recognition of lipopolysaccharide. We previously found that bovine gammadelta T cells express CD36 transcripts. Here, we tested whether bovine gammadelta T cells express CD36 protein and if so, whether it functions in a manner similar to the monocyte molecule. CD36 transcripts and internal and cell surface protein could be detected in resting, sorted gammadelta T cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin treatment increased CD36 transcript levels (detectable at 4 h) and protein expression (internal and cell surface). Increased surface antigen expression was detectable by 24 h and was maximal at 72 h following PMA/ionomycin stimulation. Anti-CD36 monoclonal antibody inhibited increased macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha gene expression in gammadelta T cells activated by LTA. In conclusion, gammadelta T cells express CD36, previously thought to be a myeloid and endothelial cell-restricted surface antigen, and it contributes to responses by these cells to microbial LTA.
CFTR chloride channels are encoded by the gene mutated in patients with cystic fibrosis. These channels belong to the superfamily of ABC transporter ATPases. ATP-driven conformational changes, which in other ABC proteins fuel uphill substrate transport across cellular membranes, in CFTR open and close a gate to allow transmembrane flow of anions down their electrochemical gradient. New structural and biochemical information from prokaryotic ABC proteins and functional information from CFTR channels has led to a unifying mechanism explaining those ATP-driven conformational changes.
ABCG2 is a member of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) family of cell surface transport proteins. ABCG2 is expressed in many types of primitive repopulating cells, and may be a marker of tumor stem cells. The physiologic role of ABCG2 seems to be excretion of genotoxic substances from the body and from primitive repopulating cell populations. A unifying hypothesis is presented, linking the expression of ABCG2 in normal and malignant stem cells with a physiologic role for protection of stem cells. Future studies will explore the possible role of ABCG2 in tumor stem cells and how this may influence the selection of new cancer therapeutic strategies.
G6PD deficiency may render afflicted individuals more susceptible to certain degenerative diseases. To clarify the relationship between G6PD deficiency and cataract, blood G6PD activity was determined in patients with cataract in Taiwan. The cases and hospital-based controls were recruited from the medical outpatient department and from the physical checkup department at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, respectively. A questionnaire survey was used to determine associations between cataracts and their risk factors. G6PD activity in fresh RBC was quantitatively measured and genomic DNA was extracted from lymphocyte nuclei. The mean blood G6PD activity among cataract patients (278.1 U/10[12] RBC) was similar to that of normals (288.0 U/10[12] RBC). No statistically significant difference in the distribution of G6PD activities as grouped by an increment of 100 U/[10, 12] RBC was observed between cataract patients and normal subjects. The predominant forms of G6PD gene mutation (cDNA 1376 G to T and 95 A to G) were both found in the patients with cataract. The adjusted odds ratio for cataract was 1.21 for every decrement of 100 U/10[12] RBC of G6PD activity in these subjects. These data indicate that G6PD activity is not a potential risk factor for senile cataract in Taiwan.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene frequently mutated in human cancers. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that PTEN can exert its tumor suppressive function through a variety of mechanisms, including regulation of cell death and cell proliferation. However, it is still unclear which of the many downstream pathways are critical in each different tissue, in vivo. Loss of PTEN is the earliest detectable genetic lesion in the estrogen-related type I (endometrioid) endometrial cancer. Pten(+/-) mice develop endometrial neoplastic lesions with full penetrance, thus providing a model system to dissect the genetic and biochemical events leading to the transition from normal to hyperplastic and neoplastic endometrial epithelium. Here, we show that loss of Pten in the mouse endometrium activates Akt and results in increased phosphorylation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) on Ser(167). ERalpha phosphorylation results, in turn, in the activation of this nuclear receptor both in vivo and in vitro, even in the absence of ligand, and in its increased ability to activate the transcription of several of its target genes. Strikingly, reduction of endometrial ERalpha levels and activity dramatically reduces the neoplastic effect of Pten loss in the endometrium, in contrast to complete estrogen depletion. Thus, we provide for the first time in vivo evidence supporting the hypothesis that loss of Pten and subsequent Akt activation result in the activation of ERalpha-dependent pathways that play a pivotal role in the neoplastic process.
ABCG2 is an ATP-binding cassette half-transporter conferring resistance to chemotherapeutic agents such as mitoxantrone, irinotecan, and flavopiridol. With its one transmembrane and one ATP-binding domain, ABCG2 is thought to homodimerize for function. One conserved region potentially involved in dimerization is a three-amino acid sequence in transmembrane segment 5 (residues 552-554). Mutations in the corresponding residues in the Drosophila white protein (an orthologue of ABCG2) are thought to disrupt heterodimerization. We substituted glycine 553 with leucine (G553L) followed by stable transfection in HEK 293 cells. The mutant was not detectable on the cell surface, and markedly reduced protein expression levels were observed by immunoblotting. A deficiency in N-linked glycosylation was suggested by a reduction in molecular mass compared to that of the 72 kDa wild-type ABCG2. Similar results were observed with the G553E mutant. Confocal microscopy demonstrated mostly ER localization of the G553L mutant in HEK 293 cells, even when coexpressed with the wild-type protein. Despite its altered localization, the G553L and G553E mutants were cross-linked using amine-reactive cross-linkers with multiple arm lengths, suggesting that the monomers are in the proximity of each other but are unable to complete normal trafficking. Interestingly, when expressed in Sf9 insect cells, G553L moves to the cell membrane but is unable to hydrolyze ATP or transport the Hoechst dye. Still, when coexpressed, the mutant interferes with the Hoechst transport activity of the wild-type protein. These data show that glycine 553 is important for protein trafficking and are consistent with, but do not yet prove, its involvement in ABCG2 homodimerization.
PTEN is a tumour suppressor protein with phosphatase activity frequently altered in several types of human cancers.
CYP2C9 is one of the major drug metabolizing enzymes for many drugs including warfarin, NSAIDs and losartan. It is polymorphic in many populations. Data on the distribution of CYP2C9 and the implication of CYP2C9 polymorphism in the Malaysian population is lacking. Our objectives were therefore to investigate the prevalence of CYP2C9 variants among unrelated healthy volunteers of Malays, Chinese and Indians in Malaysia.
SOD1 gene mutations are the most common identified cause of ALS, accounting for approximately 20% of familial ALS cases and around 4% of sporadic ALS cases. However, the prevalence of SOD1 varies in different ethnic groups. No previous epidemiological studies have been carried out in Catalonia.
ACP6 (acid phosphatase 6, lysophosphatidic) is a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-specific phosphatase that hydrolyzes LPA to monoacylglycerol and is involved in lipid metabolism in the mitochondria. Its role in oncogenesis and cancer progression has not been studied. In this study, we examined the expression of ACP6 mRNA and evaluated its clinical significance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Expression of ACP6 mRNA was quantified by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using the LightCycler in 70 esophageal ESCC specimens and their paired normal esophageal mucosa. The data were analyzed with reference to clinicopathological factors. ACP6 mRNA expression in esophageal cancer tissue was significantly lower than that in corresponding normal esophageal mucosa (P=0.0301). Among the esophageal cancer tissues, ACP6 mRNA expression significantly correlated with local tumor invasion (T factor, P=0.0461) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.0128). Furthermore, low ACP6 mRNA expression was associated with a significantly shorter survival time compared with high expression (log-rank test, P=0.0358). In multivariate analysis, ACP6 mRNA expression emerged as a significant independent factor (P=0.0148). Impaired ACP6 expression may lead to more aggressive invasion of ESCC, and ACP6 mRNA expression level could be an independent prognostic factor for patients with ESCC.
ABO and D phenotyping of both blood donors and patients receiving transfusions is routinely performed by blood banks to ensure compatibility. These analyses are performed by antibody-based agglutination assays. Blood is not tested for minor blood group antigens on a regular basis, however, because of cost and time constraints. This can result in alloimmunization of the patient against one to several minor antigens and may complicate future transfusions.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10) is the first antioncogene with phosphatase activity till now, and was found absent or mutational in many primary malignant tumors and cell lines. Its inactivation is correlated to tumor development and prognosis. This study was to investigate the effects of PTEN transfection on proliferation and invasion of human bladder cancer cell line BIU87.
CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 exhibit significant overlap in substrate specificity, but can differ in catalytic activity and regioselectivity. To investigate their characteristics further, the enzymatic reactions of the two CYP3A enzymes were compared using midazolam, nifedipine, testosterone and terfenadine as substrates. Both CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 showed sigmoid and substrate inhibition patterns for testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation and terfenadine t-butylhydroxylation (TFDOH), respectively. In the other reactions, the kinetic model for CYP3A5 was not similar to that for CYP3A4. An inhibition study demonstrated that the interactions between alpha-naphthoflavone (alphaNF) and CYP3A substrates were different for the two CYP3A enzymes. alphaNF stimulated nifedipine oxidation catalysed by CYP3A5, but did not stimulate that catalysed by CYP3A4. alphaNF at less than 32 microM inhibited TFDOH catalysed by CYP3A5, but did not inhibit that catalysed by CYP3A4. These results indicate that CYP3A5 has different enzymatic characteristics from CYP3A4 in some CYP3A catalysed reactions.
PTEN frequently shows loss of heterozygosity in breast and prostate cancers, and mutations in this gene are responsible for Cowden disease, a rare Mendelian syndrome that includes breast cancer as part of its phenotype. Thus, PTEN serves as a candidate susceptibility gene for both breast and prostate cancer risk. Whether common inherited variation (either coding or noncoding) at the PTEN locus contribute to nonfamilial, sporadic breast and prostate cancer risk is not known. In this study, we employed a linkage disequilibrium-based approach to test for association between common genetic variation at the PTEN locus and breast and prostate cancer risk in African-American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese, Latina, and White men and women in the Multiethnic Cohort Study. We genotyped 17 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; >/=5% frequency in at least one ethnic group) spanning the PTEN gene to define the common alleles in these populations. These SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium, indicating that our survey captured most of the common sequence variation across this locus. Eight tagging SNPs were selected to predict the common PTEN haplotypes (>/=0.05 frequency) in these populations (two additional tagging SNPs were required for African Americans). These SNPs were evaluated in a breast cancer case-control study (cases, n = 1,615; controls, n = 1,962) and prostate cancer case-control study (cases, n = 2,320; controls, n = 2,290) nested within the Multiethnic Cohort Study. Multiple testing was explicitly accounted for by applying a permutation-based framework. We found no strong association with any common haplotype in relation to breast or prostate cancer risk. In summary, our results show that common variants in PTEN do not substantially influence risk of these two common cancers.
CP Ti was mirror-polished and then abraded with waterproof SiC papers of two different grit sizes: 16 and 3 microm. As-polished and abraded surfaces were characterized by means of EPMA, XPS, XRD, and hardness test. Oxygen in the mirror-polished surface was uniformly distributed at the lowest level. Comparatively, abrading with SiC papers increased the surface oxygen amount and hardness. Owing to its excellent abrasivity, the coarse grit efficiently scratched the surface and hindered the regenerated oxide film from growing thick, but allowed only the metal-oxide interfacial gradient zone to extend. But, the fine grit merely rubbed the surface and allowed both the oxide film and interfacial zone to extend. Further, the surface appeared to be lightly yellow-colored, suggesting that the oxide film was thicker, probably within 10 nm, than the nominal one. When compared with the bulk, the interfacial zone was rich in oxygen and therefore subjected to high coherency strain, which was introduced to relieve the great lattice mismatch between the outer and inner layers of titanium substrate. Effects of solute oxygen hardening and strain hardening were speculated to be responsible for the surface hardening of both SiC-abraded surfaces. In conclusion, abrading with a coarse grit led to accumulation of a high, non-uniform strain in the titanium substrate, thereby hardening the surface further.
ACE Inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, but ACEI may do so incompletely when administered as monotherapy at conventional doses. In theory, combining an ACEI and ARB might be beneficial, whereas clinical evidence for this approach in hypertension is lacking. An ACEI-ARB combination is likely to be useful in proteinuric renal disease, but recent experimental evidence suggests that very high dose monotherapy with an ARB may be the best approach. However, the results of large outcome studies for combinations vs. ACEI or ARB monotherapy are still awaited.
PTEN is a dual-specificity phosphatase that has been shown to inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration, two key events in the ethiopathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Adenovirus-mediated PTEN overexpression inhibited the formation of vascular obstructive lesions induced by mechanical injury of the vessel wall. In this study, we investigated whether PTEN protects against atheroma formation in apolipoprotein E-null mice (apoE-/-), a widely used animal model characterized by the development of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. We examined atheroma development in the aorta of apoE-/- mice with an intact Pten gene and apoE-/- mice lacking one allele of Pten (Pten(+/-)apoE-/-) that were challenged for six weeks with an atherogenic diet. Compared with apoE-/- controls, Western blot analysis of arterial cell lysates from Pten(+/-)apoE-/- mice revealed a decrease in PTEN expression. This correlated with increased phosphorylation of AKT, thus demonstrating that Pten inactivation in Pten(+/-)apoE-/- mice has functional consequences. However, the extent of atherosclerosis was undistinguishable in both groups of fat-fed mice. Likewise, the atheroma of Pten(+/-)apoE-/- and apoE-/- mice displayed similar VSMC content, cellularity and rates of proliferation and apoptosis. Thus, in spite of the cytostatic and antimigratory activities of PTEN, and in contrast to previous studies demonstrating that Pten is haplo-insufficient for tumor suppression, our results demonstrate that atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic mice is not aggravated by partial inactivation of Pten.
ABCA3 mutations are known to cause fatal surfactant deficiency.
PTEN (phosphatase with tensin homology) is a potent negative regulator of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, an evolutionarily conserved pathway that signals downstream of growth factors, including insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1. In lower organisms, this pathway participates in fuel metabolism and body size regulation and insulin-like proteins are produced primarily by neuronal structures, whereas in mammals, the major source of insulin is the pancreatic beta cells. Recently, rodent insulin transcription was also shown in the brain, particularly the hypothalamus. The specific regulatory elements of the PI3K pathway in these insulin-expressing tissues that contribute to growth and metabolism in higher organisms are unknown. Here, we report PTEN as a critical determinant of body size and glucose metabolism when targeting is driven by the rat insulin promoter in mice. The partial deletion of PTEN in the hypothalamus resulted in significant whole-body growth restriction and increased insulin sensitivity. Efficient PTEN deletion in beta cells led to increased islet mass without compromise of beta-cell function. Parallel enhancement in PI3K signaling was found in PTEN-deficient hypothalamus and beta cells. Together, we have shown that PTEN in insulin-transcribing cells may play an integrative role in regulating growth and metabolism in vivo.
CYP2C19 polymorphisms and smoking influence the efficacy of H. pylori eradication therapy, but interaction between the two have hitherto not been examined. A total of 142 H. pylori-positive patients who received triple drug therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin were categorized into three groups with regard to diplotypes of CYP2C19: homozygous extensive metabolizer (homEM), heterozygous EM (hetEM), and poor metabolizer (PM). The overall success rate was 61.3%. Smoking was an independent risk factor of eradication failure (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.14-6.91), whereas CYP2C19 polymorphisms were less influential. Among non-smokers, the homEM and hetEM groups showed worse eradication rates (58.5 and 67.3%) relative to PM (76.2%) as expected; however, an opposite trend was observed among smokers (homEM 50.0%, hetEM 46.7%, PM 20.0%), indicating possible interactions with CYP2C19 polymorphisms. Smoking has a greater influence on H. pylori eradication than the CYP2C19 genotype. Interaction between smoking and CYP2C19 should be examined in the future.
"PTEN tumor suppressor inactivation is the earliest step in endometrial carcinogenesis, occurring in morphologically unremarkable endometrial glands in half of normal women. We test the hypothesis that sex hormones positively or negatively select for these ""latent precancers"" by examining their emergence, persistence, and regression rates under differing hormonal conditions. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women had an intake endometrial biopsy and underwent hormonal therapy with progestin-impregnated intrauterine device (IUD; n = 21), cyclic oral progestins (n = 28), or surveillance only (n = 22) with follow-up biopsies. For comparison, premenopausal naturally cycling endometrial biopsies were studied as single time points in 87 patients and multiple surveillance time points in 34 patients. Biopsies in which any PTEN protein-null glands were found by immunohistochemistry were scored as containing a latent endometrial precancer. All groups had a similar proportion of latent precancers at intake but differed after therapy. Emergence rates were highest (21%) for the naturally cycling premenopausal group compared with just 9% for untreated perimenopausal women. The IUD group had the highest rate of regression, with a 62% pretherapy and 5% post-therapy rate of latent precancers. This contrasted to nonsignificant changes for the oral progestin and untreated control groups. Delivery of high doses of progestins locally to the endometrium by IUD leads to ablation of preexisting PTEN-inactivated endometrial latent precancers and is a possible mechanism for reduction of long-term endometrial cancer risk known to occur in response to this hormone."
CD38 is a type II glycoprotein that catalyzes the formation of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), an intracellular calcium signalling molecule, from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)). Using a modified version of the fluorimetric cycling assay for cADPR which reduces between-subject variability, we report significant decreases in brain and lung cADPR, which although similar to previously published values, showed much less individual variation. The reduced variation within each group suggests that the range of cADPR is narrower than previously thought, and that the regulatory mechanisms controlling these levels are more finely tuned. We also report significant increases in brain, lung, and kidney NAD(+) in the Cd38(-/-) mouse, and provide the first experimental demonstration of the proximate relationship between CD38 and NAD(+).
ABO blood-type and rhesus distribution were studied in 548 Armenian women with endometrial carcinoma according to Rh-Hr system. The control group included 33,413 plus 440 healthy Armenian women with similar blood characteristics. The ratio of individuals with AB (IV) Rh (-) blood was found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05) as compared to controls. It is suggested that these findings should be taken into account when forming high-risk groups of Armenian patients with endometrial carcinoma.
LPO and apoptosis in blood mononuclear cells were studied in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis before and during treatment with standard chemotherapeutics. Pulmonary tuberculosis was accompanied by LPO activation and intensification of apoptosis in lymphocytes and monocytes. These changes were observed before and after the course of intensive care. The intensity of lipid peroxidation retuned to normal, while activity of apoptosis remained high after therapy.
CYP2E1 metabolizes compounds, including clinical drugs, organic solvents, and tobacco-specific carcinogens. Chlorzoxazone (CZN) is a probe drug used to phenotype for CYP2E1 activity. Smokers have increased CZN clearance during smoking compared with nonsmoking periods; however, it is unclear which cigarette smoke component is causing the increased activity. The relationships between in vivo CZN disposition, in vitro CZN metabolism, and hepatic CYP2E1 have not been investigated in a within-animal design. In control-treated monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops), the in vivo CZN area under the curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC(inf)) was 19.7 +/- 4.5 microg x h/ml, t1/2 was 0.57 +/- 0.07 h, and terminal disposition rate constant calculated from last three to four points on the log-linear end of the concentration versus time curve was 1.2 +/- 0.2 /h. In vitro, the apparent Vmax was 3.48 +/- 0.02 pmol/min/mug microsomal protein, and the Km was 95.4 +/- 1.8 microM. Chronic nicotine treatment increased in vivo CZN disposition, as indicated by a 52% decrease in AUC(inf) (p < 0.01) and 52% decrease in Tmax (p < 0.05) compared with control-treated monkeys. The log metabolic ratios at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h significantly negatively correlated with CZN AUC(inf) (p = 0.01-0.0001). Monkey hepatic CYP2E1 levels significantly correlated with both in vivo AUC(inf) (p = 0.03) and in vitro (p = 0.004) CZN metabolism. Together, the data indicated that nicotine induction of in vivo CZN disposition is related to the rates of in vitro CZN metabolism and hepatic microsomal CYP2E1 protein levels. Nicotine is one component in cigarette smoke that can increase in vivo CZN metabolism via induction of hepatic CYP2E1 levels. Thus, nicotine exposure may affect the metabolism of CYP2E1 substrates such as acetaminophen, ethanol, and benzene.
PDE10A is a newly identified phosphodiesterase that is highly expressed by the medium spiny projection neurons of the striatum. In order to investigate the physiological role of PDE10A in the central nervous system, PDE10A knockout mice (PDE10A(-/-)) were characterized both behaviorally and neurochemically. PDE10A(-/-) mice showed decreased exploratory activity and a significant delay in the acquisition of conditioned avoidance behavior when compared to wild-type (PDE10A(+/+)) mice. However, in a variety of other well-characterized behavioral tasks, including the elevated plus maze (anxiety), forced swim test (depression), hot plate (nociception) and two memory models (passive avoidance and Morris water maze), PDE10A(-/-) mice performed similarly to wild-type mice. When challenged with PCP or MK-801, PDE10A(-/-) mice showed a blunted locomotor response in comparison to PDE10A(+/+) mice. In contrast, PDE10A(-/-) and PDE10A(+/+) mice responded similarly to the locomotor stimulating effects of amphetamine and methamphetamine. Our findings suggest that PDE10A is involved in regulating striatal output, possibly by reducing the sensitivity of medium spiny neurons to glutamatergic excitation. These results are discussed in relationship to the hypothesis that PDE10A inhibition presents a novel treatment for psychosis.
HDC with PBSCT is effective for some intractable cases with malignant neoplasma. We encountered an intractable case of mediastinal seminoma treated by HDC with PBSCT. The patient was a 25-year-old man with mediastinal seminoma. He had undergone chemo-radiotherapy several times and salvage surgery for the mediastinal tumor and chest wall recurrence since September 2001. He was referred to our clinic for management of recurrent seminoma in the chest wall in January 2004. In our clinic, chemo-radiotherapy consisting of cisplatin and etoposide was performed. The tumor size decreased transiently, but re-growth was observed 2 months after chemo-radiotherapy. We then performed HDC with PBSCT twice without any lethal complication. Now, the patient is well and disease-free 1 year after HDC with PBSCT.
ABCA1 promotes cholesterol efflux from cells and is required for maintaining plasma cholesterol levels. Cholesterol homeostasis is important in the production of beta-amyloid (Abeta), a peptide that is overproduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Overexpression of ABCA1 can be achieved by stimulating Liver X Receptors (LXR), and changes in Abeta have been reported after LXR stimulation in vitro. To determine whether ABCA1 could alter endogenous Abeta levels, we used two different in vivo systems. We first examined the effects of an LXR agonist (TO-901317) on wild-type mice and found an increase in brain ABCA1 and apoE levels, which caused an increase in plasma cholesterol. This was accompanied by a decrease in brain Abeta levels. We then examined endogenous Abeta levels in ABCA1 knockout mice and found that, despite having no ABCA1, lowered brain apoE levels, and lowered plasma cholesterol, there was no change in Abeta levels. To assess these in vivo models in an in vitro system, we designed a model in which cholesterol transport via ABCA1 (or related transporters) was prevented. Switching off cholesterol efflux, even in the presence of TO-901317, caused no change in Abeta levels. However, when efflux capability was restored, TO-901317 reduced Abeta levels. These data show that promoting cholesterol efflux is a viable target for Abeta reducing strategies; however, knockout of cholesterol transporters is not sufficient to alter Abeta in vitro or in vivo.
CYP4B1 is highly expressed in rat nasal respiratory mucosa, and to a lesser extent in olfactory mucosa. Examination of high-power photomicrographs suggests that CYP4B1 may be a secreted protein, based on the fact that immunoreactivity appears to be present in the lumens of ducts of Bowman's glands (rather than intracellular localization, as we observed with an antibody recognizing CYP2F4) and in secretory granules in respiratory mucosa. Furthermore, anti-CYP4B1 immunoreactivity is present on the surface of both respiratory and olfactory mucosa. We used SignalP 3.0 analysis to ascertain the likelihood that rat CYP4B1 is a secreted protein. While this analysis does not suggest that rat CYP4B1 is a secreted protein, several other cytochrome P450 enzymes were predicted to be secreted proteins. The observation that multiple human cytochrome P450s appear to be secreted proteins helps to explain the appearance of anti-cytochrome P450 antigens in cases of human autoimmune liver diseases.
CFTR mutations cause defects of CFTR protein production and function by different molecular mechanisms. The mutations can be classified according to the mechanisms by which mutations disrupt CFTR function. This understanding of the different molecular mechanism of CFTR dysfunction provides the scientific basis for development of targeted drugs for mutation specific therapy of CF. Class I mutations are nonsense mutations that result in the presence of premature stop codon that leads to the production of unstable mRNA or the release from the ribosome of a short truncated protein that is not functional. The aminoglycoside antibiotics can suppress premature termination codons by disrupting translational fidelity and allowing the incorporation of an amino acid, thus permitting translation to continue to the normal termination of the transcript. Class II mutations cause impairment of CFTR processing and folding in the Golgi. As a result the mutant CFTR is retained in the ER and eventually targeted for degradation by the quality control mechanisms. Chemical and molecular chaperons such as Sodium-4-phenylbutyrate can stabilize protein structure, and allow it to escape from degradation in the ER and be transported to the cell membrane. Class III mutations disrupt the function of the regulatory domain. CFTR is resistant to phosphorylation or ATP binding. CFTR activators such as alkylxanthines (CPX) and the flavonoid genistein can overcome the affected ATP binding through direct binding to a nucleotide binding fold. In patients carrying class IV mutations, phosphorylation of CFTR results in reduced chloride transport. Increases in the overall cell surface content of these mutants might overcome the relative reduction in conductance. Alternatively restoring native chloride pore characteristics pharmacologically might be effective. Activators of CFTR at the plasma membrane may function by promoting CFTR phosphorylation, by blocking CFTR dephosphorylation, by interacting directly with CFTR, and/or by modulation of CFTR protein-protein interactions. Class V mutations affect the spicing machinery and generate both aberrantly and correctly spliced transcripts, the level of which vary among different patients and among different organs of the same patient. Splicing factors that promote exon inclusion or factors that promote exon skipping can promote increase of correctly spliced transcripts, depending on the molecular defect. Inconsistent results were reported regarding the required level of corrected or mutated CFTR that has to be reached in order to achieve normal function.
PTEN is a dual phosphatase that negatively regulates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway important for cell survival. We determined effects of the inflammation and oxidative stresses of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), respectively, on PTEN, Akt, and GSK3beta signalling in rat primary cortical neurons. The inhibitors bisperoxovanadium [bpV(Pic)] and LY294002 were also used to determine PTEN and PI3K involvement in TNFalpha and HNE modulation of neuronal cell death. PTEN inhibition with bpV(Pic) alone did not affect Ser(473)Akt or Ser(9)GSK3beta phosphorylation. Instead, effects of this inhibitor were manifest when it was used together with TNFalpha and to a lesser extent with HNE. TNFalpha together with PTEN inhibition increased phosphorylation of Ser(473)Akt and Ser(9)GSK3beta. TNFalpha and HNE both gave decreased numbers of viable and increased numbers of early apoptotic neurons. PTEN inhibition partially reversed the toxic effect of TNFalpha as shown by an increased number of viable and a decreased number of early apoptotic neurons. All effects were reversed by PI3K inhibition. HNE together with inhibition of PTEN gave increased Ser(473)Akt but not Ser(9)GSK3beta phosphorylation and no effects on the number of viable or early apoptotic cells. In conclusion, PTEN inhibition gives a mild reversal of TNFalpha- but not HNE-induced cell death via the PI3K pathway.
SOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2) plays a crucial role in protecting the cells against damage caused by free radicals, by catalyzing their detoxification. On the other hand, cell damage caused by free radical generation following methamphetamine administration has been postulated as one of the possible pathophysiological mechanisms for methamphetamine psychosis. Hence, we investigated the association of SOD2 polymorphisms with the development of methamphetamine psychosis, in two independent populations of Japan and Taiwan. We recruited 116 patients with methamphetamine psychosis and 189 controls in Japan, and 135 patients with methamphetamine psychosis and 204 controls in Taiwan. The methamphetamine group was divided into two clinical subtypes: a transient type of psychosis (i.e., good prognosis) and a prolonged type of psychosis (i.e., poor prognosis), according to the course of the manifestation of psychosis. With reference to the genotypic and allelic frequencies of Ala/Val functional polymorphism in exon 2, we found significant differences between individuals with prolonged methamphetamine psychosis and control samples from Japan and Taiwan in the genotypic (P value 0.014 and 0.016, respectively) and in the allelic (P value 0.004 and 0.047, respectively) frequencies. Our results suggest that Ala/Val polymorphism of the SOD2 gene could be associated with the risk of developing methamphetamine psychosis.
CYP2C9 substrates can exhibit both hyperbolic and atypical kinetic profiles, and their metabolism can be activated or inhibited depending on the effector studied. CYP2C9 genetic variants can also affect both substrate turnover and kinetic profile. The present study assessed whether analogs of the effector amiodarone differentially altered the atypical kinetic profile of the substrate naproxen and whether this effect was genotype-dependent. Amiodarone, desethylamiodarone, benzbromarone, and its dimethyl analog (benz(meth)arone) were incubated with naproxen and either CYP2C9.1 or CYP2C9.3. Amiodarone activated naproxen demethylation at lower concentrations, regardless of the CYP2C9 allele, and inhibited metabolism at higher concentrations without altering the kinetic profile. Desethylamiodarone was a potent inhibitor of naproxen demethylation, irrespective of the CYP2C9 allele. Benzbromarone altered naproxen demethylation kinetics from a biphasic profile to that of a hyperbolic form in CYP2C9.1 and CYP2C9.3, resulting in inhibition and activation, respectively. In contrast, benz(meth)arone activated naproxen demethylation in both CYP2C9.1 and CYP2C9.3. In addition, the kinetic profile of naproxen demethylation became more hyperbolic at lower concentrations of benz(meth)arone and then reverted back to biphasic as the benz(meth)arone was increased further. Equilibrium binding and multiple-ligand docking studies were used to propose how such similar compounds exerted very different effects on naproxen metabolism. In summary, effectors of CYP2C9 metabolism can alter not only the degree of substrate turnover (activation or inhibition) but also the kinetic profile of metabolism of CYP2C9 substrates through effects on substrate binding and orientation. In addition, these kinetics effects are concentration- and genotype-dependent.
PTEN is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. Germ line mutations of PTEN have been detected in three rare autosomal-dominant disorders. However, identical mutations in the PTEN gene may lead to different symptoms that have traditionally been described as different disorders, such as Cowden disease, Lhermitte-Duclos disease, and Bannayan-Zonana syndromes. This lack of genotype-phenotype correlation prompted us to directly test the possible effects of genetic background or modifier genes on PTEN-controlled tumorigenesis using genetically engineered mouse models. In this study, we generated two animal models in which either exon 5 (Pten(Delta5)) or promoter to exon 3 (Pten(-)) of the murine Pten gene were deleted and compared phenotypes associated with individual mutations on two genetic backgrounds. We found that the onset and spectrum of tumor formation depend significantly on the genetic background but less on the type of mutation generated. Our results suggest that PTEN plays a critical role in cancer development, and genetic background may influence the onset, the spectrum, and the progression of tumorigenesis caused by Pten mutation.
CD38 expression of tumor cells has been identified as an important prognostic factor in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Although CD38 is involved in effector functions of T cells, the prognostic value of CD38+ T cells has not yet been addressed in B-CLL. In the present study, CD38-expression levels in B-CLL cells and T cells from 204 patients were analyzed by flow cytometry and correlated with clinical and molecular risk parameters. CD38 expression significantly differed in the neoplastic clone from patients with low versus advanced stage, irrespective of the sex of patients. In contrast, CD38 expression was generally higher in T cells from female compared with male patients but only increased in male patients in a stage-dependent manner. In male patients, combined analysis of CD38 in T cells and B-CLL cells identified 4 subgroups with significantly different treatment-free survival. Multivariate analysis including Rai stage and molecular risk parameters of the neoplastic clone identified CD38-expression levels in T cells as an independent prognostic factor in male patients. Combined analysis of CD38 in B-CLL and T cells is superior in predicting outcome of male B-CLL patients than either parameter alone. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the sex-specific role of CD38+ T cells in B-CLL.
CD36 is necessary for inhibition of some angiogenic responses by the matricellular glycoprotein thrombospondin-1 and is therefore assumed to be the receptor that mediates its anti-angiogenic activities. Although ligation of CD36 by antibodies, recombinant type 1 repeats of thrombospondin-1, or CD36-binding peptides was sufficient to inhibit nitric oxide (NO)-stimulated responses in both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, picomolar concentrations of native thrombospondin-1 similarly inhibited NO signaling in vascular cells from wild-type and CD36-null mice. Ligation of the thrombospondin-1 receptor CD47 by recombinant C-terminal regions of thrombospondin-1, thrombospondin-1 peptides, or CD47 antibodies was also sufficient to inhibit NO-stimulated phenotypic responses and cGMP signaling in vascular cells. Thrombospondin-1 did not inhibit NO signaling in CD47-null vascular cells or NO-stimulated vascular outgrowth from CD47-null muscle explants in three-dimensional cultures. Furthermore, the CD36-binding domain of thrombospondin-1 and anti-angiogenic peptides derived from this domain failed to inhibit NO signaling in CD47-null cells. Therefore, ligation of either CD36 or CD47 is sufficient to inhibit NO-stimulated vascular cell responses and cGMP signaling, but only CD47 is necessary for this activity of thrombospondin-1 at physiological concentrations.
PHOSPHO1 is a phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine phosphatase that has previously been implicated in generating inorganic phosphate (P(i)) for matrix mineralization. In this study, we have investigated PHOSPHO1 mRNA expression during embryonic development in the chick. Whole-mount in situ hybridization indicated that PHOSPHO1 expression occurred prior to E6.5 and was initially restricted to the bone collar within the mid-shaft of the diaphysis of long bones but by E11.5 expression was observed over the entire length of the diaphysis. Alcian blue/alizarin red staining revealed that PHOSPHO1 expression seen in the primary regions of ossification preceded the deposition of mineral, suggesting that it is involved in the initial events of mineral formation. We isolated MVs from growth plate chondrocytes and confirmed the presence of high levels of PHOSPHO1 by immunoblotting. Expression of PHOSPHO1, like TNAP activity, was found to be up-regulated in MVs isolated from chondrocytes induced to differentiate by the addition of ascorbic acid. This suggests that both enzymes may be regulated by similar mechanisms. These studies provide for the first time direct evidence that PHOSPHO1 is present in MVs, and its developmental expression pattern is consistent with a role in the early stages of matrix mineralization.
CD38 has been widely characterised both as an ectoenzyme and as a receptor. In the present paper, we investigated the role of CD38 as possible modulator of apoptosis. CD38-positive (CD38(+)) and negative (CD38(-)) fractions, obtained by sorting CD38(+) cells from lymphoma T (Jurkat) and lymphoma B (Raji) and by transfecting lymphoma LG14 and myeloid leukemia K562 cell lines, were used. Cellular subpopulations were exposed to different triggers (H(2)O(2), UV-B, alpha-TOS and hrTRAIL) and the extent of apoptosis was determined by Annexin V-FITC/PI assay. Our data showed that, in lymphoma cells, propensity to apoptosis was significantly linked to CD38 expression and that, remarkably, such response was independent of the nature of the trigger used. Inhibition of CD38 expression by antisense oligonucleotides treatment resulted in CD38-silenced fractions which were as prone to apoptosis as CD38(-) ones. Notably, susceptibility of K562 to apoptosis-inducing challenges was not affected by CD38 expression.
CD38 is a type II transmembrane protein with 25% of its molecular mass consisting of glycosyl moieties. It has long been predicted that the carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins play important roles in the physical function and structural stability of the proteins on cell surfaces. To determine the structural/functional significance of glycosylation of the human CD38, the four potential N-linked glycosylation sites asparagine residues, N100, N164, N209 and N219 were mutated. The mutant (CD38mu) and wild-type (CD38wt) were expressed separately in Escherichia coli, HeLa, and MCF-7 cells. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and western blotting indicated that the molecular mass of the CD38wt is 45 kDa, and that of the CD38mu is 34 kDa in HeLa cells. Importantly, the CD38mu protein expressed in HeLa cells, showed the high molecular weight oligomers in addition to the 34 kDa monomeric form. Similarly, in E. coli, the CD38wt formed dimers and other oligomers besides the monomeric form. Moreover, MCF-7 cells stably transfected with CD38wt cDNA, also revealed the presence of cross-linked oligomers when treated with a N-linked glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (TM). These results suggested that the N-linked glycosylation of CD38 plays a crucial role in the structure stability by preventing the formation inter-molecular cross-links. In addition, immunostaining, enzyme activity (cyclase), and western blotting data revealed that the glycosylation of human CD38 protein is not required for its localization to the cell membrane.
ABCC2 is a member of the multidrug resistance protein subfamily localized exclusively to the apical membrane domain of polarized cells, such as hepatocytes, renal proximal tubule epithelia, and intestinal epithelia. This localization supports the function of ABCC2 in the terminal excretion and detoxification of endogenous and xenobiotic organic anions, particularly in the unidirectional efflux of substances conjugated with glutathione, glucuronate, or sulfate, as exemplified by leukotriene C(4), bilirubin glucuronosides, and some steroid sulfates. The hepatic ABCC2 pump contributes to the driving forces of bile flow. Acquired or hereditary deficiency of ABCC2, the latter known as Dubin-Johnson syndrome in humans, causes an increased concentration of bilirubin glucuronosides in blood because of their efflux from hepatocytes via the basolateral ABCC3, which compensates for the deficiency in ABCC2-mediated apical efflux. In this article we provide an overview on the molecular characteristics of ABCC2 and its expression in various tissues and species. We discuss the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of ABCC2 and review approaches to the functional analysis providing information on its substrate specificity. A comprehensive list of sequence variants in the human ABCC2 gene summarizes predicted and proven functional consequences, including variants leading to Dubin-Johnson syndrome.
AQP3 (aquaporin-3), known as an integral membrane channel in epidermal keratinocytes, facilitates water and glycerol movement into and out of the skin. Here, we demonstrate that AQP3 is also expressed in cultured human skin fibroblasts, which under normal wound healing processes migrate from surrounding tissues to close the wound. EGF (epidermal growth factor), which induced fibroblast migration, also induced AQP3 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. CuSO4 and NiCl2, previously known as AQP3 water transport inhibitors, as well as two other bivalent heavy metals Mn2+ and Co2+, inhibited EGF-induced cell migration in human skin fibroblasts. AQP3 knockdown by small interfering RNA inhibited EGF-induced AQP3 expression and cell migration. Furthermore, an EGFR (EGF receptor) kinase inhibitor, PD153035, blocked EGF-induced AQP3 expression and cell migration. MEK [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) kinase]/ERK inhibitor U0126 and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) inhibitor LY294002 also inhibited EGF-induced AQP3 expression and cell migration. Collectively, our findings show for the first time that AQP3 is expressed in human skin fibroblasts and that EGF induces AQP3 expression via EGFR, PI3K and ERK signal transduction pathways. We have provided evidence for a novel role of AQP3 in human skin fibroblast cell migration, which occurs during normal wound healing.
GGT1 gene of the methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha appears to be a structural and functional homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CIS2/ECM38 gene encoding gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gammaGT). This is confirmed by the absence of the corresponding activity of gammaGT in the mutant with disrupted GGT1 gene. It was shown that gammaGT of both H. polymorpha and S. cerevisiae are involved in detoxification of electrophilic xenobiotics, as the corresponding mutants appeared to be defective in the disappearance of the fluorescent vacuolar complex of GSH with xenobiotic bimane and the further diffuse distribution of this complex in the cytosol. We hypothesize that metabolism of electrophilic xenobiotics in the yeasts H. polymorpha and S. cerevisiae occurs through a gammaGT-dependent mercapturic acid pathway of GSH-xenobiotic detoxification, similar to that known for mammalian cells, with cysteine-xenobiotics and/or N-acetylcysteine-xenobiotics as the end products.
CYP2A6 plays important roles in the metabolism of nicotine and some clinically used drugs. Interindividual variability in the CYP2A6 expression level in human liver might be caused by an inducible property, but the molecular mechanism of induction is unclear. Rifampicin, phenobarbital, and 6-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]thiazole-5-carbaldehyde O-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)oxime, which are activators of pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), induced CYP2A6 mRNA in human hepatocytes. We identified three direct repeat separated by four nucleotides (DR4)-like elements at -6698, -5476, and -4618 in the CYP2A6 gene, to which PXR and CAR could bind after dimerization with retinoid X receptor (RXR)-alpha. In luciferase assays, overexpression of PXR or CAR could not activate the transcriptional activity of CYP2A6 promoter constructs (-6754 to -1) in HepG2 cells. Cotransfection of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha did not affect the transcriptional activities in the absence or presence of PXR or CAR. Interestingly, cotransfection of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) as well as PXR significantly enhanced the transcriptional activity (3.9-fold of control). By the deletion of a possible suppresser region (-4533 to -185), the effects of PXR/PGC-1alpha on the transcriptional activity were increased (6.9-fold of control). Deletion or mutation analyses revealed that two DR4-like elements at -5476 and -4618 are essential for transactivation by PXR/PGC-1alpha. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that PXR and PGC-1alpha bind to CYP2A6 chromatin. In conclusion, we found that CYP2A6 is induced via PXR and PGC-1alpha through the DR4-like element at the distal response region. This is the first study to report the molecular mechanism of the induction of CYP2A6.
CYP2C9 is the third most important cytochrome P450 (CYP) in terms of number of drugs metabolised. A considerable amount of information on this isoform is now available with respect to its structural biology, the mechanisms by which it can be induced and the existence of a range of variant alleles, which are often functionally significant. CYP2C9 makes a very important contribution to metabolism of vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants, and is the main oxidising enzyme for S-warfarin and S-acenocoumarol as well as contributing to phenprocoumon metabolism. A large number of studies have now shown that CYP2C9 genotype predicts dose requirement for both warfarin and acenocoumarol, with a possible contribution for phenprocoumon. Patients with variant alleles are likely to require a lower dose and may be at risk of overcoagulation and resultant bleeding, especially during the induction phase of therapy. Although CYP2C9 genotype is clearly a predictor of vitamin K antagonist dose requirement, especially in Caucasian populations in whom variant alleles are common, a number of recent studies have shown that age, genotype for the gene encoding the target gene vitamin K epoxide reductase and concomitant drugs are equally important factors in determining dose. There is a need for prospective studies to assess the value of predicting dose requirement on the basis of all these factors, including the CYP2C9 genotype.
CYP2J2 metabolizes arachidonic acid to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which play a critical role in the regulation of renal, pulmonary, cardiac, and vascular function. However, the contribution of CYP2J2 to EET formation in the liver remains poorly characterized. Likewise, information is sparse regarding the extent and variability of CYP2J2 expression during human development. This investigation was undertaken to characterize the variability of CYP2J2 expression in fetal liver, heart, kidney, lung, intestine, and brain and in postnatal liver samples. CYP2J2 mRNA expression was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunoreactive CYP2J2 was examined using two anti-CYP2J2 antibodies. CYP2J2 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in pre- and postnatal samples. Fetal hepatic mRNA expression varied 127-fold (1351 +/- 717 transcripts/ng total RNA), but this variation was reduced to 8-fold after exclusion of four samples with extremely low levels of mRNA. Amounts of immunoreactive protein also varied substantially among samples without an apparent relationship with transcript number or genotype. Western blot analysis revealed a different protein pattern between prenatal and postnatal liver samples. DNA resequencing of selected subjects identified a single novel single-nucleotide polymorphism (CYP2J2*10), which was found in only one subject and therefore did not explain the large variability in CYP2J2 protein content. In vitro expression suggests that the protein product of CYP2J2*10 confers reduced enzymatic activity. Aberrant splicing produces three minor transcripts, which were present in all samples tested. Due to premature termination codons, none encodes functional protein. The mechanisms leading to variable amounts of immunoreactive protein and distinct pre- and postnatal CYP2J2 protein patterns warrant further investigation.
PTEN gene, a novel tumor suppressor is frequently mutated or deleted in several malignancies including human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We report previously that human hepatitis B virus-X (HBx) protein achieves protection from apoptotic cell death through-PI3K-Akt-Bad signaling that is p53-independent in liver cells (JBC; 276, 16969 (2000)). In this report, we demonstrated the PTEN effect on HBx induced anti-apoptotic signaling in Chang liver cells (CHL). Expression of PTEN in CHL cells downregulate HBx induced PI3K, Akt activities, Akt, Bad phosphorylations, decreased caspase 3 activity and protection from DNA fragmentations. PTEN suppression of CHL cell growth at G1 phase (JBC;278,4057(2003)) in cell cycle analysis, which is overcome by HBx activated Akt/PKB further confirmed that same PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in cell survival and apoptosis by HBx and PTEN. PTEN suppression of HBx-mediated cell survival through PI3K pathway is specific, since PTEN does not suppress the effect of HBx on the protection from Fas-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PTEN potently modulate HBx-mediated signaling and is a viable target in therapeutic approaches to inhibit the formation of HCC caused by HBV infections.
CYP4B1 belongs to the mammalian CYP4 enzyme family that also includes CYP4A, 4F, 4V, 4X, and 4Z subfamilies. CYP4B1 shares with other CYP4 proteins a capacity to omega-hydroxylate medium-chain fatty acids, which may be related to an endogenous role for the enzyme. CYP4B1 also participates in the metabolism of certain xenobiotics that are protoxic, including valproic acid, 3-methylindole, 4-ipomeanol, 3-methoxy-4-aminoazobenzene, and numerous aromatic amines. Although these compounds have little in common structurally or chemically, their metabolism by CYP4B1 leads to tissue-specific toxicities in several experimental animals. The bioactivation capabilities of rabbit CYP4B1 have also attracted attention in the cancer community and form the basis of a potential therapeutic strategy involving prodrug activation by the CYP4B1 transgene. The metabolic capabilities of human CYP4B1 are less clear due to difficulties in heterologous expression and existence of alternatively spliced products. Also, many CYP4B1 enzymes covalently bind their heme, a posttranslational modification unique to the CYP4 family of P450s, but common to the mammalian peroxidases. These varied characteristics render CYP4B1 an interesting and enigmatic investigational target.
ABCA1 controls the first step in reverse cholesterol transport. The potential associations between G1051A (R219K) and -565C/T genetic polymorphisms in the ABCA1 gene, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and subclinical cardiovascular disease in the general population remains unclear. We examined these associations in a sample of Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants.
ABCG2 encodes a transmembrane transporter associated with multidrug resistance in various cancer cells. ABCG2 is also highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and is down-regulated in most committed progenitors, whereas expression is sharply up-regulated during erythroid differentiation. The mechanisms for regulation of ABCG2 expression in hematopoietic cells are poorly understood. We have recently identified three novel leader exons (termed E1A, E1B, and E1C) located in the 5'-untranslated region of mouse Abcg2 mRNA by data base searches and reverse transcription-PCR. In a mouse erythroid cell line, reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that the transcript containing E1B exon was the only isoform detected. Consistently, the E1B-containing transcript was the predominant isoform of Abcg2 mRNA in primary Ter119+ erythroid cells from mouse bone marrow as well as in mouse fetal liver cells. In contrast, the E1A-containing transcript was highly expressed in c-Kit+, Sca-1+, Lin- (KSL) bone marrow cells, especially in CD34- KSL fraction, which is highly enriched for repopulating HSCs. The differential expression pattern of Abcg2 mRNA isoforms in mouse HSCs and erythroid cells was confirmed by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, indicating that at least two different promoters control mouse Abcg2 transcription during hematopoiesis. Promoter functional assays using EGFP as reporter gene demonstrated that the E1A 5'-flanking region had promoter activity, which contains multiple putative hematopoietic transcription factor binding sites. In summary, our data show that the expression of Abcg2 during hematopoiesis is transcriptionally regulated by alternative use of multiple leader exons and promoters in a developmental stage-specific manner.
CD36 is a member of the scavenger receptor type B family implicated in the binding of lipoproteins, phosphatidylserine, thrombospondin-1, and the uptake of long-chain fatty acids. On mononuclear phagocytes, recognition of apoptotic cells by CD36 contributes to peripheral tolerance and prevention of autoimmunity by impairing dendritic cell (DC) maturation. Besides, CD36 acts as a coreceptor with TLR2/6 for sensing microbial diacylglycerides, and its deficiency leads to increased susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus infections. The RUNX3 transcription factor participates in reprogramming DC transcription after pathogen recognition, and its defective expression leads to abnormally accelerated DC maturation. We present evidence that CD36 expression is negatively regulated by the RUNX3 transcription factor during myeloid cell differentiation and activation. In molecular terms, RUNX3 impairs the activity of the proximal regulatory region of the CD36 gene in myeloid cells through in vitro recognition of two functional RUNX-binding elements. Moreover, RUNX3 occupies the CD36 gene proximal regulatory region in vivo, and its overexpression in myeloid cells results in drastically diminished CD36 expression. The down-regulation of CD36 expression by RUNX3 implies that this transcription factor could impair harmful autoimmune responses by contributing to the loss of pathogen- and apoptotic cell-recognition capabilities by mature DCs.
AQP4 (aquaporin 4) internalization and a concomitant decrease in the osmotic water permeability coefficient (Pf) after histamine exposure has been reported in AQP4-transfected gastric HGT1 cells.
PTEN phosphatase mediates several developmental cues involving cell proliferation, growth, death, and migration. We investigated the function of the PTEN gene at the transition from the cell proliferation state to morphogenesis around the midblastula transition (MBT) and gastrulation in Xenopus embryos. An immunoblotting analysis indicated that PTEN expresses constantly through embryogenesis. By up- or down-regulating PTEN activity using overexpression of the active form or C terminus of PTEN before MBT, we induced elongation of the cell cycle time just before MBT or maintained its speed even after MBT, respectively. The disruption of the cell cycle time by changing the activity of PTEN delayed gastrulation after MBT. In addition, PTEN began to localize to the plasma membranes and nuclei at MBT. Overexpression of a membrane-localizing mutant of PTEN caused dephosphorylation of Akt, whereas overexpression of the C terminus of PTEN caused phosphorylation of Akt and inhibited the localization of EGFP-PTEN to the plasma membranes and nuclei. These results indicate that an appropriate PTEN activity, probably regulated by its differential localization, is necessary for coordinating cell proliferation and early morphogenesis.
CYP27A1 catalyses hydroxylations in the biosynthesis of bile acids and the bioactivation of vitamin D3. We investigated the expression of CYP27A1 in human monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and dendritic cells on mRNA and protein levels as well as its enzymatic activity in comparison with the expression of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1. Macrophages showed a strong expression of CYP27A1, whereas monocytes and dendritic cells expressed low levels of CYP27A1 mRNA. Immunohistochemistry revealed CYP27A1 and CYP27B1 protein expression in macrophages. Accordingly, macrophages converted vitamin D3 into the active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D3. Dendritic cells also metabolized vitamin D3 although to a lesser extent. This could be due to the high expression of CYP24A1, the enzyme that degrades 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3. Our results show that macrophages and dendritic cells are capable to perform both hydroxylation steps of the vitamin D3 metabolism suggesting a possible role of local 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis by myeloid cells in the skin and gut.
WWOX is a putative tumor suppressor gene that spans approximately a 1 Mb genomic region and is the site for the second most common chromosomal fragile site, FRA16D at 16q23. Various studies have focused on the expression of WWOX in human cancer mostly at the RNA level, but little is known about the normal pattern of WWOX protein expression in non-neoplastic tissues. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of WWOX protein expression in normal tissues was performed by means of immunohistochemistry utilizing a very specific anti-WWOX polyclonal antibody. We analyzed tissue cores of human samples representing more than 30 organs, using various tissue microarray (TMA) slides. Due to the potential role of WWOX in sex-steroid metabolism, whole sections from hormonally regulated organs like breast, ovaries, testes and prostate were also analyzed. The results from our study indicate that WWOX is preferentially highly expressed in secretory epithelial cells of reproductive, endocrine and exocrine organs, as well as in ductal epithelial cells from specific segments of the urinary system. Interestingly, we also observed significant WWOX protein expression in various cell types of neural origin including neurons, ependymal cells and astrocytes. No expression of WWOX was detected in adipose, connective, and lymphoid tissues, myelinized structures and blood vessels. By better defining the topographic distribution of WWOX in normal tissues this study provides some insight on the potential physiological role of this novel protein.
ABCA1 controls the rate-limiting step in HDL particle formation and is therefore an attractive molecular target for raising HDL levels and protecting against atherosclerosis. Intestinal ABCA1 significantly and independently contributes to plasma HDL cholesterol levels in mice, suggesting that induction of intestinal ABCA1 expression may raise plasma HDL cholesterol levels. We evaluated the ability of a synthetic Liver X Receptor (LXR) agonist, GW3965, to raise plasma HDL cholesterol levels in control mice and mice with liver- or intestinal-specific deletion of the Abca1 gene. Oral treatment with GW3965 increased the expression of ABCA1 by approximately 6-fold (P=0.004) as well as other LXR target genes in the intestines of mice, with no change in the hepatic expression of these genes. This resulted in a significant approximately 48% elevation of plasma HDL cholesterol levels in wild-type mice (P<0.01) with no change in plasma triglycerides. A similar increase in HDL cholesterol was observed in mice lacking hepatic ABCA1, indicating that the increase in plasma HDL cholesterol was independent of hepatic ABCA1. This effect was completely abrogated in mice lacking intestinal ABCA1. These data indicate that intestinal ABCA1 may be an attractive therapeutic target for raising HDL levels while avoiding the hepatic lipogenesis and hypertriglyceridemia typical of systemic LXR activation.
STS belong to the most challenging diseases in oncology that demand all resources of modern clinical oncology. With the improvement of surgical techniques and radiation therapy the majority of patients with localized disease can be cured. However, for patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease chemotherapeutic treatments have not greatly changed the poor outcome of the disease. The introduction of combined chemoradiotherapy as well as isolated limb-perfusion has improved the limb-salvage rate in locally advanced disease but the impact of systemic chemotherapy on overall survival remains a subject of dispute. For patients with metastatic sarcoma long-term survival can only be achieved in a small number of patients with mostly resectable disease. The list of effective drugs for palliative treatment in general still remains short and the duration of remissions usually does not exceed several months. The lack of alternative chemotherapeutic drugs imposes a considerable challenge in daily clinical practice with many young patients exhibiting a good performance status but progressive disease after standard treatment. A variety of new drugs or drug combinations seem to exhibit considerable activity in certain histological sarcoma subtypes, which may soon broaden the armamentarium of drugs for a subset of patients. However, with the vastly improved understanding of the biology and pathology of soft tissue sarcoma an era of opportunities seems to have begun and the recent success in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors impressively shows how fast a gain in the understanding of oncogenic mechanisms may translate into a highly efficient, clinically useful treatment.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in many human cancers. We used the Cre-loxP system to generate an urothelium-specific null mutation of Pten in mice [FabpCrePten(flox/flox) (FPten(flox/flox)) mice]. Histologic examination revealed that all FPten(flox/flox) mice exhibited urothelial hyperplasia in which component cells showed enlarged nuclei and increased cell size. With time, 10% of FPten(flox/flox) mice spontaneously developed pedicellate papillary transitional cell carcinomas (TCC). This type of tumor also arose in FPten(flox/flox) mice treated with the chemical carcinogen N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine. FPten(flox/flox) urothelial cells were hyperproliferative and showed increased activation of the survival signaling molecules Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. In humans, 53% of primary bladder cancer patients exhibited decreased or absent expression of PTEN protein in either the cytoplasm or nucleus of tumor cells. In early bladder cancers, PTEN expression was repressed in 42% of superficial papillary TCC but in only 8% of cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS). In advanced bladder cancers, PTEN protein was significantly reduced (particularly in the nucleus) in 94% of cases, and this decrease in PTEN correlated with disease stage and grade. Thus, PTEN deficiency may contribute to bladder cancer both by initiating superficial papillary TCC and by promoting the progression of CIS to advanced invasive and metastatic forms.
BHMT (betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase) remethylates homocysteine to form methionine. SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) inhibits BHMT activity, but whether SAM modulates BHMT gene expression is unknown. Transcriptional regulation of the human BHMT is also unknown. The present study examined regulation of the human BHMT gene by SAM and its metabolite, MTA (5'-methylthioadenosine). To facilitate these studies, we cloned the 2.7 kb 5'-flanking region of the human BHMT gene (GenBank accession number AY325901). Both SAM and MTA treatment of HepG2 cells resulted in a dose- and time-dependent decrease in BHMT mRNA levels, which paralleled their effects on the BHMT promoter activity. Maximal suppression was observed with the BHMT promoter construct -347/+33, which contains a number of NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) binding sites. SAM and MTA treatment increased NF-kappaB nuclear binding and NF-kappaB-driven luciferase activities, and increased nuclear binding activity of multiple histone deacetylase co-repressors to the NF-kappaB sites. Overexpression of p50 and p65 decreased BHMT promoter activity, while blocking NF-kappaB activation increased BHMT expression and promoter activity, and prevented SAM but not MTA's ability to inhibit BHMT expression. The NF-kappaB binding site at -301 is responsible, at least in part, for this effect. Lower BHMT expression can impair homocysteine metabolism, which can induce ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress. Indeed, MTA treatment resulted in increased expression ER stress markers. In conclusion, SAM and MTA down-regulate BHMT expression in HepG2 cells in part by inducing NF-kappaB, which acts as a repressor for the human BHMT gene. While SAM's mechanism is NF-kappaB-dependent, MTA has both NF-kappaB-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
ABCG2 is a ubiquitous ATP-binding cassette transmembrane protein that is important in clinical drug resistance. Little is known about the mechanism(s) regulating the expression of ABCG2. We hypothesized that DNA methylation could play a role in the epigenetic regulation of ABCG2 gene expression. The promoter methylation status of three renal carcinoma cell lines was assessed with restriction enzyme digestion-coupled PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing. Both UOK121 and UOK143, with known methylation of the VHL promoter, showed induction of ABCG2 expression after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) treatment, suggesting that aberrant methylation of the ABCG2 gene was associated with gene silencing. In vitro methylation of the ABCG2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter vector resulted in a significant inhibition of transcription. Our data suggested that the ABCG2 gene is regulated coordinately at both histone and DNA levels. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that the methylated promoter in UOK121 and UOK143, but not the unmethylated one in UOK181, is associated with the methyl CpG binding domain proteins (MBDs), MBD2 and MeCP2. Histone deacetylase 1 and a corepressor, mSin3A, were identified binding to the promoter region containing the CpG island, thereby suppressing ABCG2 transcription. Reactivation of ABCG2 was achieved by treatment with 5-aza-dC, a demethylating agent, concomitant with the release of MBDs from the promoter. Furthermore, the association of methylated lysine 9 on histone H3, a hallmark of promoter methylation, with the promoter was reduced following 5-aza-dC treatment. These data suggest that DNA methylation-dependent formation of a repressor complex in the CpG island contributes to inactivation of ABCG2.
UCP3 has been postulated to function in the defense against lipid-induced oxidative muscle damage (lipotoxicity). We explored this hypothesis during cachexia in rats (zymosan-induced sepsis), a condition characterized by increased oxidative stress and supply of fatty acids to the muscle. Muscle UCP3 protein content was increased 2, 6 and 11 days after zymosan injection. Plasma FFA levels were increased at day 2, but dropped below control levels on days 6 and 11. Muscular levels of the lipid peroxidation byproduct 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) were increased at days 6 and 11 in zymosan-treated rats, supporting a role for UCP3 in modulating lipotoxicity during cachexia.
CAD is the most common cause of death in older persons and was present in 43% of 1,160 men and in 41% of 2,464 women, mean age 81 years. Hypertension was present in 60% of these older women and in 57% of these older men. The prevalence of valvular aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and MAC increases with age in older men and in older women. The prevalence and incidence of CHF increase with age. CHF is the most common cause of hospitalization in persons aged 65 years and older. The prevalence of normal LV ejection fraction associated with CHF increases with age and is higher in older women than in older men. The prevalence of chronic atrial fibrillation increases with age and was present in 16% of 1,160 older men and in 13% of 2,464 older women. Atrial fibrillation is an independent predictor of new coronary events and thromboembolic stroke in older persons. Older persons who have unexplained syncope should have 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms to determine whether pauses of longer than 3 seconds are present that require permanent pacemaker implantation.
CEL I, extracted from celery, is the first known eukaryotic nuclease that cleaves DNA with high specificity at sites of base-substitution mismatch and DNA distortion. It is a key enzyme for TILLING research. Here we reported a crude extraction method and activity assay of CEL I. Incision at mismatches of single nucleotide suggested that CEL I can effectively detect DNA at G-->A base substitution and the result can be obtained from an ABI377 Sequencer. Therefore, the extracted enzyme can be used in TILLING.
RRM1 encodes the regulatory subunit of ribonucleotide reductase and is a molecular target of gemcitabine. Previous studies showed increased RRM1 expression on continuous exposure of cell lines to gemcitabine and suggested improved survival for patients with low as opposed to high tumoral RRM1 expression when treated with gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy. However, the principal hypothesis that intratumoral levels of gene expression are associated with disease response has not been addressed.
PC maker Lenovo started out as a distributor of equipment made by IBM and other companies; now it has formed a joint venture with IBM and will eventually affix its own logo to its computers. Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) started out manufacturing vehicles for Volkswagen and GM; now it's preparing to sell its own cars in China, Europe, and North America. Lenovo and SAIC represent a host of formerly anonymous makers of brand-name products that are breaking out of their defined roles and pushing the brands themselves aside. In this article, the authors explore the double-edged relationships original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) forge with their contract manufacturers (CMs). On the one hand, an OEM can reduce its labor costs, free up capital, and improve worker productivity by outsourcing all the manufacturing of a product. The company can then concentrate on value-adding activities--research and development, product design, and marketing, for instance. On the other hand, an OEM that retains a contract manufacturer may find itself immersed in a melodrama replete with promiscuity (the ambitious CM pursues liaisons with other OEMs), infidelity (the OEM's retailers and distributors shift their business to the upstart CM), and betrayal (the brazen CM transmits the OEM's intellectual property to the OEM's rivals or keeps it for itself when the contract is up). OEMs cannot simply terminate their outsourcing arrangements--they need contract manufacturers in order to keep specializing, adding value, and staying competitive. But OEMs can manage these relationships so that they don't become weak or the CMs too strong. Doing so requires modesty about revealing trade secrets; caution about whom one consorts with; and a judicious degree of intimacy, loyalty, and generosity toward partners and customers.
ENPP1 (nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1) encodes a membrane-bound glycoprotein that inhibits the insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in reduced insulin sensitivity. Hence, variants in this gene may be related to obesity and insulin resistance.
ABCA3 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transport proteins and is required for perinatal respiratory adaptation. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were generated against a recombinant human ABCA3 peptide and used to assess its expression in the developing lung and adult tissues. Immunostaining for ABCA3 was detected at highest levels in type II epithelial cells of the lung but was also noted in other organs including liver, stomach, kidney, adrenal, pancreas, trachea, and brain. In the fetal lung, ABCA3 staining and mRNA increased prior to birth. Like other surfactant protein genes, ABCA3 expression was induced by thyroid transcription factor-1 in vitro. ABCA3 was coexpressed with SP-B and proSP-C in type II epithelial cells. ABCA3 staining was detected surrounding large, intracellular organelles consistent with its association with lamellar bodies. In the human fetal lung, ABCA3 staining was not detected prior to 22-23 weeks of gestation, except in the presence of pulmonary inflammation. ABCA3 was detected in type II epithelial cells of the human lung from 28 weeks of gestation and thereafter. Postnatally, intense ABCA3 staining was observed in hyperplastic epithelial cells relining injured airways in infants with chronic lung disease. Localization and regulation of ABCA3 in the respiratory epithelium is consistent with its proposed role in surfactant homeostasis. The role of ABCA3 in extrapulmonary tissues and organs remains to be elucidated. This manuscript contains online supplemental material at (www.jhc.org).

CYP3A4 has been subjected to random and site-directed mutagenesis to enhance peroxide-supported metabolism of several substrates. Initially, a high-throughput screening method using whole cell suspensions was developed for H2O2-supported oxidation of 7-benzyloxyquinoline. Random mutagenesis by error-prone polymerase chain reaction and activity screening yielded several CYP3A4 mutants with enhanced activity. L216W and F228I showed a 3-fold decrease in Km, HOOH and a 2.5-fold increase in kcat/Km, HOOH compared with CYP3A4. Subsequently, T309V and T309A were created based on the observation that T309V in CYP2D6 has enhanced cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH)-supported activity. T309V and T309A showed a > 6- and 5-fold higher kcat/Km, CuOOH than CYP3A4, respectively. Interestingly, L216W and F228I also exhibited, respectively, a > 4- and a > 3-fold higher kcat/Km, CuOOH than CYP3A4. Therefore, several multiple mutants were constructed from rationally designed and randomly isolated mutants; among them, F228I/T309A showed an 11-fold higher kcat/Km, CuOOH than CYP3A4. Addition of cytochrome b5, which is known to stimulate peroxide-supported activity, enhanced the kcat/Km, CuOOH of CYP3A4 by 4- to 7-fold. When the mutants were tested with other substrates, T309V and T433S showed enhanced kcat/Km, CuOOH with 7-benzyloxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin and testosterone, respectively, compared with CYP3A4. In addition, in the presence of cytochrome b5, T433S has the potential to produce milligram quantities of 6beta-hydroxytestosterone through peroxide-supported oxidation. In conclusion, a combination of random and site-directed mutagenesis approaches yielded CYP3A4 enzymes with enhanced peroxide-supported metabolism of several substrates.
CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), a member of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) superfamily of membrane proteins, possesses two NBDs (nucleotide-binding domains) in addition to two MSDs (membrane spanning domains) and the regulatory 'R' domain. The two NBDs of CFTR have been modelled as a heterodimer, stabilized by ATP binding at two sites in the NBD interface. It has been suggested that ATP hydrolysis occurs at only one of these sites as the putative catalytic base is only conserved in NBD2 of CFTR (Glu1371), but not in NBD1 where the corresponding residue is a serine, Ser573. Previously, we showed that fragments of CFTR corresponding to NBD1 and NBD2 can be purified and co-reconstituted to form a heterodimer capable of ATPase activity. In the present study, we show that the two NBD fragments form a complex in vivo, supporting the utility of this model system to evaluate the role of Glu1371 in ATP binding and hydrolysis. The present studies revealed that a mutant NBD2 (E1371Q) retains wild-type nucleotide binding affinity of NBD2. On the other hand, this substitution abolished the ATPase activity formed by the co-purified complex. Interestingly, introduction of a glutamate residue in place of the non-conserved Ser573 in NBD1 did not confer additional ATPase activity by the heterodimer, implicating a vital role for multiple residues in formation of the catalytic site. These findings provide the first biochemical evidence suggesting that the Walker B residue: Glu1371, plays a primary role in the ATPase activity conferred by the NBD1-NBD2 heterodimer.
CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme capable of generating metabolites that release Ca2+ from intracellular stores, including nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). A number of studies have led to the controversial proposal that CD38 mediates an alternate pathway for glucose-stimulated insulin release and contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes. It has recently been shown that NAADP mediates Ca2+ mobilization by insulin in human pancreatic beta-cells. In the present study, we report altered Ca2+ homeostasis and reduced responsiveness to insulin, but not glucose, in Cd38-/- beta-cells. In keeping with the antiapoptotic role of insulin signaling, Cd38-/- islets were significantly more susceptible to apoptosis compared with islets isolated from littermate controls. This finding correlated with disrupted islet architecture and reduced beta-cell mass in Cd38-/- mice, both in the context of a normal lab diet and a high-fat diet. Nevertheless, we did not find robust differences in glucose homeostasis in vivo or glucose signaling in vitro in Cd38-/- mice on the C57BL/6 genetic background, in contrast to previous studies by others of Cd38 knockout mice on the ICR background. Thus, our results suggest that CD38 plays a role in novel antiapoptotic signaling pathways but does not directly control glucose signaling in pancreatic beta-cells.
LPL and its specific physiological activator, apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II), regulate the hydrolysis of triglycerides (TGs) from circulating TG-rich lipoproteins. Previously, we developed a skeletal muscle-specific LPL transgenic mouse that had lower plasma TG levels. ApoC-II transgenic mice develop hypertriglyceridemia attributed to delayed clearance. To investigate whether overexpression of LPL could correct this apoC-II-induced hypertriglyceridemia, mice with overexpression of human apoC-II (CII) were cross-bred with mice with two levels of muscle-specific human LPL overexpression (LPL-L or LPL-H). Plasma TG levels were 319 +/- 39 mg/dl in CII mice and 39 +/- 5 mg/dl in wild-type mice. Compared with CII mice, apoC-II transgenic mice with the higher level of LPL overexpression (CIILPL-H) had a 50% reduction in plasma TG levels (P = 0.013). Heart LPL activity was reduced by approximately 30% in mice with the human apoC-II transgene, which accompanied a more modest 10% decrease in total LPL protein. Overexpression of human LPL in skeletal muscle resulted in dose-dependent reduction of plasma TGs in apoC-II transgenic mice. Along with plasma apoC-II concentrations, heart and skeletal muscle LPL activities were predictors of plasma TGs. These data suggest that mice with the human apoC-II transgene may have alterations in the expression/activity of endogenous LPL in the heart. Furthermore, the decrease of LPL activity in the heart, along with the inhibitory effects of excess apoC-II, may contribute to the hypertriglyceridemia observed in apoC-II transgenic mice.
NOS2 gene-deficient (NOS2(-/-)) mice are less susceptible than wild-type (NOS2(+/+)) mice to infection with Influenza A virus. Virus titres in the lungs of influenza-infected NOS2(-/-) mice are significantly lower than those in NOS2(+/+) mice, with enhanced viral clearance in NOS2(-/-) mice dependent on gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). The current study was undertaken to ascertain the role of specific components of the immune response in promoting virus clearance in influenza-infected NOS2(-/-) mice. Levels of T cell- and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity in the lungs of virus-infected mice were not significantly different between NOS2(+/+) and NOS2(-/-) mice. However, virus-infected NOS2(-/-) mice produced higher levels of virus-specific IgG2a antibody. Furthermore, more viable B cells and plasmablasts, along with greater levels of IFN-gamma, were found in NOS2(-/-) splenocyte cultures stimulated with B-cell mitogens. In addition to the early reduction in virus titres, clinical symptoms and proinflammatory cytokine production were attenuated in NOS2(-/-) mice. Thus, NOS2(-/-) B cells are capable of responding rapidly to influenza virus infection by proliferating and preferentially producing antibody of the IgG2a subtype. The relationship between viral load and the development of immunopathology is discussed.
RDH12 has been suggested to be one of the retinol dehydrogenases (RDH) involved in the vitamin A recycling system (visual cycle) in the eye. Loss of function mutations in the RDH12 gene were recently reported to be associated with autosomal recessive childhood-onset severe retinal dystrophy. Here we show that RDH12 localizes to the photoreceptor inner segments and that deletion of this gene in mice slows the kinetics of all-trans-retinal reduction, delaying dark adaptation. However, accelerated 11-cis-retinal production and increased susceptibility to light-induced photoreceptor apoptosis were also observed in Rdh12(-/-) mice, suggesting that RDH12 plays a unique, nonredundant role in the photoreceptor inner segments to regulate the flow of retinoids in the eye. Thus, severe visual impairments of individuals with null mutations in RDH12 may likely be caused by light damage(1).
CYP2A6 inactivates nicotine to cotinine and cotinine to 3-hydroxycotinine. We investigated which of plasma nicotine and metabolites were most related to CYP2A6 genotype and smoking levels. We assessed demographic and smoking histories in 152 Caucasian ad libitum smokers, measured breath carbon monoxide (CO) levels, and determined plasma nicotine, cotinine, and 3-hydroxycotinine by high-performance liquid chromatography and CYP2A6 genotypes by PCR. Cigarettes per day was most closely related to CO (r = 0.60, P < 0.001) followed by plasma cotinine (r = 0.53, P < 0.001), whereas plasma cotinine was most strongly correlated with CO levels (r = 0.74, P < 0.001), confirming that cotinine is a good indicator of smoking levels; this was not limited by CYP2A6 variants. 3-Hydroxycotinine/cotinine is reported to be a good marker of CYP2A6 activity, and we found that the 3-hydroxycotinine/(cotinine + nicotine) ratio was most correlated with CYP2A6 genotype (r = 0.38, P < 0.001). Inclusion of the CYP2A6*12A allele strengthened the correlation (r = 0.46, P < 0.001), suggesting that the identification of novel alleles will continue to improve this relationship. Nicotine metabolism is slower in smokers, and we have shown that CYP2A6 is reduced by nicotine treatment in monkeys. Here, we found that plasma nicotine levels were inversely correlated with CYP2A6 activity (3-hydroxycotinine/cotinine, r = -0.41, P < 0.001) among those without CYP2A6 variants, suggesting a reduction in metabolism with higher nicotine levels. Together, these findings (a) confirm the use of plasma cotinine and CO as indicators of Caucasians' smoking levels, and that this is not limited by CYP2A6 genetic variation; (b) indicate that 3-hydroxycotinine/cotinine and 3-hydroxycotinine/(cotinine + nicotine) are moderately good indicators of the CYP2A6 genotype; and (c) support that nicotine exposure may reduce its own metabolism.
SLC25A19 mutations cause Amish lethal microcephaly (MCPHA), which markedly retards brain development and leads to alpha-ketoglutaric aciduria. Previous data suggested that SLC25A19, also called DNC, is a mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotide transporter. We generated a knockout mouse model of Slc25a19. These animals had 100% prenatal lethality by embryonic day 12. Affected embryos at embryonic day 10.5 have a neural-tube closure defect with ruffling of the neural fold ridges, a yolk sac erythropoietic failure, and elevated alpha-ketoglutarate in the amniotic fluid. We found that these animals have normal mitochondrial ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate levels, suggesting that transport of these molecules is not the primary role of SLC25A19. We identified thiamine pyrophosphate (ThPP) transport as a candidate function of SLC25A19 through homology searching and confirmed it by using transport assays of the recombinant reconstituted protein. The mitochondria of Slc25a19(-/-) and MCPHA cells have undetectable and markedly reduced ThPP content, respectively. The reduction of ThPP levels causes dysfunction of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, which explains the high levels of this organic acid in MCPHA and suggests that mitochondrial ThPP transport is important for CNS development.
CYP2A6 is a polymorphic enzyme, and CYP2A6 genotype has been shown to be associated with smoking habits and lung cancer. We investigated CYP2A6 polymorphism in Japanese from four different geographic areas of Japan and in the Ovambo and Turk populations. Using two polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLPs), we identified the functionally important variants of CYP2A6: *1A, *1B, *1F, *1G, *4A, and *4D. In the Japanese population the highest frequencies of the CYP2A6*1A allele were observed in subjects from the Fukuoka (Kyushu Island) and Ehime (Shikoku Island) prefectures, whereas subjects in Shimane and Tottori (both located on the Japan Sea side of Honshu Island) showed the highest frequencies of the CYP2A6*1B allele. In the Tottori and Shimane groups no subject was homozygous for the CYP2A6*4A allele, a whole gene deletion type that is prevalent among Asians. In the Ovambo and Turk populations the CYP2A6*1A allele was predominant. Furthermore, two alleles undetected in the Japanese were observed in these latter two ethnic groups: CYP2A6*1G was found solely in the Ovambos, and CYP2A6*1F was found solely in the Turks. The present study is the first to show interprefecture differences in CYP2A6 polymorphism in Japanese who live in relatively close but distinct geographic areas; this is also the first study to evaluate CYP2A6 variations among these Japanese and the Ovambo and Turk populations. The distribution results of these alleles could help to define the true significance of CYP2A6 polymorphism as a genetic susceptibility marker in worldwide populations.
CFTR is the only ABC (ATP-binding cassette) ATPase known to be an ion channel. Studies of CFTR channel function, feasible with single-molecule resolution, therefore provide a unique glimpse of ABC transporter mechanism. CFTR channel opening and closing (after regulatory-domain phosphorylation) follows an irreversible cycle, driven by ATP binding/hydrolysis at the nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1, NBD2). Recent work suggests that formation of an NBD1/NBD2 dimer drives channel opening, and disruption of the dimer after ATP hydrolysis drives closure, but how NBD events are translated into gate movements is unclear. To elucidate conformational properties of channels on their way to opening or closing, we performed non-equilibrium thermodynamic analysis. Human CFTR channel currents were recorded at temperatures from 15 to 35 degrees C in inside-out patches excised from Xenopus oocytes. Activation enthalpies(DeltaH(double dagger)) were determined from Eyring plots. DeltaH(double dagger) was 117 +/- 6 and 69 +/- 4 kJ/mol, respectively, for opening and closure of partially phosphorylated, and 96 +/- 6 and 73 +/- 5 kJ/mol for opening and closure of highly phosphorylated wild-type (WT) channels. DeltaH(double dagger) for reversal of the channel opening step, estimated from closure of ATP hydrolysis-deficient NBD2 mutant K1250R and K1250A channels, and from unlocking of WT channels locked open with ATP+AMPPNP, was 43 +/- 2, 39 +/- 4, and 37 +/- 6 kJ/mol, respectively. Calculated upper estimates of activation free energies yielded minimum estimates of activation entropies (DeltaS(double dagger)), allowing reconstruction of the thermodynamic profile of gating, which was qualitatively similar for partially and highly phosphorylated CFTR. DeltaS(double dagger) appears large for opening but small for normal closure. The large DeltaH(double dagger) and DeltaS(double dagger) (TDeltaS(double dagger) >/= 41 kJ/mol) for opening suggest that the transition state is a strained channel molecule in which the NBDs have already dimerized, while the pore is still closed. The small DeltaS(double dagger) for normal closure is appropriate for cleavage of a single bond (ATP's beta-gamma phosphate bond), and suggests that this transition state does not require large-scale protein motion and hence precedes rehydration (disruption) of the dimer interface.
CD36 is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor that engages in signal transduction implicated in important physiological and pathophysiological events. CD36 in platelets has been shown physically and functionally to associate with members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases, Fyn, Lyn, and Yes, but the nature of this important association has never been rigorously examined. Here, we show that CD36 does not associate with Lyn through a protein-mediated interaction. In COS cells transfected with both CD36 and Lyn these molecules did not co-precipitate, suggesting a requirement for an intermediary molecule absent from the COS cells. Yeast two-hybrid analysis confirmed that the carboxylterminal cytoplasmic tail of CD36 did not bind Lyn directly, and no Lyn binding protein bound to CD36 in a cDNA library screen. Conversely, when the CD36-Lyn association seen in platelets was analysed by biophysical parameters, dissociation occurred at 37 degrees C and also by solubilisation in octylglucoside, indicative of a lipid-mediated association. Since both CD36 and Lyn are enriched in Triton X-100-insoluble rafts at the plasma membrane, these findings point to the importance of raft-associated lipids in CD36-mediated signal transduction.
FAH (fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase) catalyses the final step of tyrosine catabolism to produce fumarate and acetoacetate. HT1 (hereditary tyrosinaemia type 1) results from deficiency of this enzyme. Previously, we prepared a partial mimic of the putative tetrahedral intermediate in the reaction catalysed by FAH co-crystallized with the enzyme to reveal details of the mechanism [Bateman, Bhanumoorthy, Witte, McClard, Grompe and Timm (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 15284-15291]. We have now successfully synthesized complete mimics CEHPOBA {4-[(2-carboxyethyl)-hydroxyphosphinyl]-3-oxobutyrate} and COPHPAA {3-[(3-carboxy-2-oxopropyl)hydroxyphosphinyl]acrylate}, which inhibit FAH in slow-onset tight-binding mode with K(i) values of 41 and 12 nM respectively. A high-resolution (1.35 A; 1 A=0.1 nm) crystal structure of the FAH.CEHPOBA complex was solved to reveal the affinity determinants for these compounds and to provide further insight into the mechanism of FAH catalysis. These compounds are active in vivo, and CEHPOBA demonstrated a notable dose-dependent increase in SA (succinylacetone; a metabolite seen in patients with HT1) in mouse serum after repeated injections, and, following a single injection (1 mumol/g; intraperitoneal), only a modest regain of FAH enzyme activity was detected in liver protein isolates after 24 h. These potent inhibitors provide a means to chemically phenocopy the metabolic defects of either HT1 or FAH knockout mice and promise future pharmacological utility for hepatocyte transplantation.
CD36 and LIMPII analog 1, CLA-1, and its splicing variant, CLA-2 (SR-BI and SR-BII in rodents), are human high density lipoprotein receptors with an identical extracellular domain which binds a spectrum of ligands including bacterial cell wall components. In this study, CLA-1- and CLA-2-stably transfected HeLa and HEK293 cells demonstrated several-fold increases in the uptake of various bacteria over mock-transfected cells. All bacteria tested, including both Gram-negatives (Escherichia coli K12, K1 and Salmonella typhimurium) and Gram-positives (Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes), demonstrated various degrees of lower uptake in control cells. This result is consistent with the presence of high-density lipoprotein-receptor-independent bacterial uptake that is enhanced by CLA-1/CLA-2 overexpression. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides, lipoteichoic acid, and synthetic amphipathic helical peptides (L-37pA and D-37pA) competed with E. coli K12 for CLA-1 and CLA-2 binding. Transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy revealed cytosolic accumulation of bacteria in CLA-1/CLA-2-overexpressing HeLa cells. The antibiotic protection assay confirmed that E. coli K12 was able to survive and replicate intracellularly in CLA-1- and CLA-2-overexpressing HeLa, but both L-37pA and D-37pA prevented E. coli K12 invasion. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from SR-BI/BII-knockout mice demonstrated a 30% decrease in bacterial uptake when compared with macrophages from normal mice. Knockout macrophages were also characterized by decreased bacterial cytosolic invasion, ubiquitination, and proteasome mobilization while retaining bacterial lysosomal accumulation. These results indicate that, by facilitating bacterial adhesion and cytosolic invasion, CLA-1 and CLA-2 may play an important role in infection and sepsis.
CYP2B6 metabolizes a number of drug substrates, that are usually non-planar, neutral or weakly basic, fairly lipophilic with one or two hydrogen bond acceptors, on which it catalyses various oxidative reactions. For bupropion, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, pethidine, ketamine and propofol, these reactions represent major metabolic or activation pathways and for their kinetics CYP2B6 function is of considerable importance. For the rest of the substrates found, CYP2B6 contributes to overall metabolism or to a single pathway, but probably not to a materially significant extent. Among inhibitors, thiotepa, ticlopidine and clopidogrel have been characterised extensively in terms of selectivity and potency. Thiotepa is the most selective of the inhibitors, but is not useful as an in vivo inhibitor, whereas ticlopidine and clopidogrel can be used as CYP2B6-selective probes in human clinical studies. Bupropion hydroxylation is a selective, and consequently useful, in vivo probe for CYP2B6. Computational approaches are being developed to the extent that predictions on affinity of chemicals to CYP2B6 are becoming reliable enough as a first screen of new drug molecules and other chemicals. With validated in vitro and in vivo substrates (e.g. bupropion) and inhibitors (e.g. ticlopidine), it is expected that pharmacological (including pharmacogenetic) and clinical significance of CYP2B6 will be delineated more fully in the near future.
DGUOK [dG (deoxyguanosine) kinase] is one of the two mitochondrial deoxynucleoside salvage pathway enzymes involved in precursor synthesis for mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) replication. DGUOK is responsible for the initial rate-limiting phosphorylation of the purine deoxynucleosides, using a nucleoside triphosphate as phosphate donor. Mutations in the DGUOK gene are associated with the hepato-specific and hepatocerebral forms of MDS (mtDNA depletion syndrome). We identified two missense mutations (N46S and L266R) in the DGUOK gene of a previously reported child, now 10 years old, who presented with an unusual revertant phenotype of liver MDS. The kinetic properties of normal and mutant DGUOK were studied in mitochondrial preparations from cultured skin fibroblasts, using an optimized methodology. The N46S/L266R DGUOK showed 14 and 10% residual activity as compared with controls with dG and deoxyadenosine as phosphate acceptors respectively. Similar apparent negative co-operativity in the binding of the phosphate acceptors to the wild-type enzyme was found for the mutant. In contrast, abnormal bimodal kinetics were shown with ATP as the phosphate donor, suggesting an impairment of the ATP binding mode at the phosphate donor site. No kinetic behaviours were found for two other patients with splicing defects or premature stop codon. The present study represents the first characterization of the enzymatic kinetic properties of normal and mutant DGUOK in organello and our optimized protocol allowed us to demonstrate a residual activity in skin fibroblast mitochondria from a patient with a revertant phenotype of MDS. The residual DGUOK activity may play a crucial role in the phenotype reversal.
NPR1 is required for systemic acquired resistance, and there are five NPR1 paralogs in Arabidopsis. Here we report knockout analysis of two of these, NPR3 and NPR4. npr3 single mutants have elevated basal PR-1 expression and the npr3 npr4 double mutant shows even higher expression. The double mutant plants also display enhanced resistance against virulent bacterial and oomycete pathogens. This enhanced disease resistance is partially dependent on NPR1, can be in part complemented by either wild-type NPR3 or NPR4, and is not associated with an elevated level of salicylic acid. NPR3 and NPR4 interact with TGA2, TGA3, TGA5 and TGA6 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis, we show that NPR3 interacts with TGA2 in the nucleus of onion epidermal cells and Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. Combined with our previous finding that basal PR-1 levels are also elevated in the tga2 tga5 tga6 triple mutant, we propose that NPR3 and NPR4 negatively regulate PR gene expression and pathogen resistance through their association with TGA2 and its paralogs.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene encoding a phosphatase, and it negatively regulates cell survival mediated by the phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3-Kinase)-Akt pathway. To elucidate PTEN expression and its effect on the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway in fibroblasts and macrophages, we investigated the expression of PTEN and the phosphorylation status of Akt in NIH3T3 and RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS. Phosphorylation of Akt was induced by LPS treatment in a dose-dependent manner in RAW264.7 cells, but not in NIH3T3 cells. LPS induced the expression of PTEN in a dose and time-dependent manner in NIH3T3 cells (0-1 microg/ml, 0-6h). However, LPS did not stimulate PTEN expression in RAW264.7 cells. These data indicate the existence of diverse mechanisms for PTEN expression and Akt activation in fibroblasts and macrophages. RNA interference using double-stranded RNA specific for the PTEN gene reduced both mRNA and protein levels of PTEN in NIH3T3 cells treated or not with LPS. The phosphorylation status of Akt in NIH3T3 cells stimulated with LPS did not change when the PTEN expression had been inhibited by RNA interference. The present results suggest that the up-regulation of PTEN expression by LPS is not involved in the activation of Akt in NIH3T3 cells. PTEN expression might be involved in the diverse inflammatory responses to LPS in fibroblasts and macrophages.
CYP2B6 is a highly variable and polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme involved in the biotransformation of an increasing number of drugs, including cyclophosphamide, bupropion, and the nonnucleosidic reverse transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz. Several nonsynonymous and promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP2B6 gene are associated with altered hepatic expression and function, which affect drug plasma concentrations.
LPL mediates the uptake of lipoproteins into different cell types independent of its catalytic activity. The mechanism of this process and its physiological relevance are not clear. Taking into account the importance of the endothelial barrier for lipoprotein uptake, in vitro studies with primary aortic endothelial cells from wild-type and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-deficient (LDLR(-/-)) mice were performed. Addition of LPL almost doubled the uptake of LDL into wild-type cells. However, there was virtually no LPL-mediated change of LDL uptake into LDLR(-/-) cells. Upregulation of LDLR by lipoprotein-deficient serum/lovastatin in wild-type cells resulted in a 7-fold increase of LPL-mediated LDL uptake. Uptake of chylomicron remnants was not affected by LDLR expression. In proteoglycan-deficient cells, LPL did not increase the uptake of lipoproteins. The physiological relevance of this pathway was studied in mice that were both LDLR(-/-) and transgenic for catalytically inactive LPL in muscle. In the presence of LDLR, inactive LPL reduced LDL cholesterol significantly (13-24%). In the absence of LDLR, LDL cholesterol was not affected by transgenic LPL. Metabolic studies showed that in the presence of LDLR, LPL increased the muscular uptake of LDL by 77%. In the absence of LDLR, transgenic LPL did not augment LDL uptake. Chylomicron uptake was not affected by the LDLR genotype. We conclude that LPL-mediated cellular uptake of LDL, but not of chylomicrons, is dependent on the presence of both LDLR and proteoglycans.
LPL and endothelial lipase (EL) are associated with macrophages in human atherosclerotic lesions, and overexpression of LPL in mouse macrophages is associated with a greater extent of atherosclerosis. To investigate potential mechanisms by which macrophage-derived lipase expression may mediate proatherogenic effects, we used lentivirus-mediated RNA interference to suppress the expression of either LPL or EL within THP-1 macrophages. After suppression of either LPL or EL, significant decreases in the concentration of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were observed. Incubation of THP-1 macrophages with either mildly or extensively oxidized LDL consistently decreased cytokine expression, which was additive to that contributed by lipase suppression. Decreased lipase expression was also associated with an altered lipid composition, with reduced percentages of cholesterol (unesterified and esterified), triglycerides, and lysophosphatidylcholine. Microarray data indicated a decreased expression of proinflammatory genes, growth factors, and antiapoptotic genes. By contrast, there was an increased expression of lipoprotein receptors (scavenger receptor 1, low density lipoprotein receptor, scavenger receptor class B type I, and CD36). Thus, we conclude that the suppression of either LPL or EL decreases proinflammatory cytokine expression and influences the lipid composition of THP-1 macrophages. These results provide further insight into the specific metabolic and potential pathological roles of LPL and EL in human macrophages.
PTEN phosphatase, a product of PTEN tumor suppressor gene, exists in cells in phosphorylated and unphosphorylated form and has a central role in regulation of PI3K/Akt signalling which is involved in non-genomic action of estradiol. The purpose of this study was to analyze the level of total PTEN and phosphoPTEN parallel to phosphoAkt in leiomyoma and adjacent myometrium during menstrual cycle and at menopause. The expression of total PTEN in leiomyoma and myometrium did not change throughout the experiments. However, the level of phosphoPTEN was increased in leiomyoma during menstrual cycle. The phosphorylation of PTEN in myometrium was lower during secretory phase than that of proliferative phase. The phosphoAkt was abundant in leiomyoma, and its expression was higher during menstrual cycle than in myometrium. The phosphorylation of PTEN was directly related to phosphoAkt, suggesting a direct link between the inactivation of PTEN and activation of Akt. At the decline of sexual steroids, at menopause, no differences were observed in the expression of studied proteins between the two types of tissues. Our results suggest that the altered phosphorylation of PTEN protein and the consequent activation of survival signals may contribute to the pathomechanism of leiomyoma.
"ABCG2 is a multidrug efflux pump associated with resistance of cancer cells to a plethora of unrelated drugs. ABCG2 is a ""half-transporter,"" and previous studies have indicated that it forms homodimers and higher oligomeric species. In this manuscript, electron microscopic structural analysis directly addressed this issue. An N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged ABCG2(R482G) isoform was expressed to high levels in insect cells. An extensive detergent screen was employed to effect extraction of ABCG2(R482G) from membranes and identified only the fos-choline detergents as efficient. Soluble protein was purified to >95% homogeneity by a three-step procedure while retaining the ability to bind substrates. Cryonegative stain electron microscopy of purified ABCG2(R482G) provided 3D structural data at a resolution of approximately 18 A. Single-particle analysis revealed that the complex forms a tetrameric complex ( approximately 180 A in diameter x approximately 140 A high) with an aqueous central region. We interpret the tetrameric structure as comprising four homodimeric ABCG2(R482G) complexes."
CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genetic variants are associated with low and intermediate warfarin dose requirements, but markers of high doses are less well characterized. We analyzed the VKORC1 coding sequence and known CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms in 15 selected warfarin-resistant (dose, 80 to 185 mg/wk) and 8 warfarin-sensitive patients (7 to 13 mg/wk) and 99 unselected controls (8 to 105 mg/wk). We identified a coding VKORC1 Asp36Tyr polymorphism in 7 of 15 resistant compared with 0 of 8 sensitive patients (P = .026) Carriers of Asp36Tyr in the control group (8 of 99) required significantly higher warfarin doses of 80.9 +/- 10.1 mg/wk compared with 42.7 +/- 7.5 mg/wk in noncarriers (F = 9.79, P = .002). Asp36Tyr was significantly associated with doses of more than 70 mg/wk (odds ratio, 13.0; 95% confidence limit, 1.3 to 124.2), while doses of 20 to 70 mg/wk were associated with Asp36Tyr (partial r(2) = .11; P = .004), CYP2C9*2 and *3 (r(2) = .08; P = .01), and VKORC1*2 and *3 markers (r(2) = .05; P = .05). All Asp36Tyr carriers also had VKORC1*1 tag-single nucleotide polymorphisms (tag-SNPs) indicating a new haplotype. Asp36Tyr was common in Jewish ethnic groups of Ethiopian (15%) and Ashkenazi (4%) origin. We suggest that Asp36Tyr is a new marker of the high end of the warfarin dosing range.
SPR electrode was used in Electrio-Fenton treatment on the effluent from biological and coagulative treatments of solid waste incinerator leachate, at the same time, the kinetics model for the COD effluent concentration were set up. The result indicated that the disposal curve of COD confirm to the pseudo third order kinetics, and the formula is c(t) = (2kt + c(0)(-2))(-0.5), in which the c(t) is the COD concentration of treatment effluent. With the statistical analysis to the disposal curve of COD from Electro-Fenton treatment in different conditions, the experience mathematics model of k value was set up, in which the current density, pH value and COD concentration of influent are effective factors. Moreover, with the comparison between the simulative COD of effluent and the experimental results, it was showed that this kinetic model could be used to investigate the COD disposal efficiency of Electro-Fenton treatment on the effluent from biological and coagulative treatments of solid waste incinerator leachate preferably.
SLC26A4 (pendrin, PDS) is a Na+-independent, Cl-/HCO3-/OH- exchanger that is expressed in the apical regions of type B and non-A, non-B intercalated cells within the cortical collecting duct (CCD), the connecting tubule and the distal convoluted tubule where it mediates HCO3- secretion and Cl- absorption. SLC26A4 is upregulated with aldosterone analogues and with Cl- restriction. While under basal conditions no renal abnormalities are observed in mice and humans with genetic disruption of SLC26A4 (Pendred syndrome), differences become apparent under conditions wherein the transporter is stimulated. Following treatment with aldosterone analogues, e.g. deoxycorticosterone pivalate (DOCP), weight gain and hypertension are observed in Slc26a4+/+ but not in Slc26a4-/- mice. During dietary NaCl restriction, a model in which serum aldosterone is appropriately increased, urinary volume and urinary excretion of Cl- are greater in Slc26a4-/- than in wild-type mice which results in apparent vascular volume contraction in Slc26a4-/- mice. Moreover, during NaCl restriction or following DOCP treatment, Slc26a4-/- mice have a higher serum HCO3- than wild type mice from an impaired ability to excrete OH- equivalents. In conclusion, SLC26A4 regulates blood pressure and arterial pH, likely by participating in the renal regulation of net acid and Cl- excretion.
SLC6A4 encodes the serotonin transporter, the protein primarily responsible for the termination of serotonin neurotransmission. Because many antidepressants inhibit the transporter, it has been the focus of intense pharmacogenetic analysis. We sought to replicate our previous findings that SLC6A4 is associated with response to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in a large case-control study.
RDH12 codes for a member of the family of short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases proposed to function in the visual cycle that supplies the chromophore 11-cis retinal to photoreceptor cells. Mutations in RDH12 cause severe and progressive childhood onset autosomal-recessive retinal dystrophy, including Leber congenital amaurosis. We generated Rdh12 knockout mice, which exhibited grossly normal retinal histology at 10 months of age. Levels of all-trans and 11-cis retinoids in dark- and light-adapted animals and scotopic and photopic electroretinogram (ERG) responses were similar to those for the wild type, as was recovery of the ERG response following bleaching, for animals matched for an Rpe65 polymorphism (p.L450M). Lipid peroxidation products and other measures of oxidative stress did not appear to be elevated in Rdh12(-/-) animals. RDH12 was localized to photoreceptor inner segments and the outer nuclear layer in both mouse and human retinas by immunohistochemistry. The present findings, together with those of earlier studies showing only minor functional deficits in mice deficient for Rdh5, Rdh8, or Rdh11, suggest that the activity of any one isoform is not rate limiting in the visual response.
CA1 pyramidal neurons from animals that have acquired hippocampal tasks show increased neuronal excitability, as evidenced by a reduction in the postburst afterhyperpolarization (AHP). Studies of AHP plasticity require stable long-term recordings, which are affected by the intracellular solutions potassium methylsulphate (KMeth) or potassium gluconate (KGluc). Here we show immediate and gradual effects of these intracellular solutions on measurement of the AHP and basic membrane properties, and on the induction of AHP plasticity in CA1 pyramidal neurons from rat hippocampal slices. The AHP measured immediately after establishing whole-cell recordings was larger with KMeth than with KGluc. In general, the AHP in KMeth was comparable to the AHP measured in the perforated-patch configuration. However, KMeth induced time-dependent changes in the intrinsic membrane properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Specifically, input resistance progressively increased by 70% after 50 min; correspondingly, the current required to trigger an action potential and the fast afterdepolarization following action potentials gradually decreased by about 50%. Conversely, these measures were stable in KGluc. We also demonstrate that activity-dependent plasticity of the AHP occurs with physiologically relevant stimuli in KGluc. AHPs triggered with theta-burst firing every 30 s were progressively reduced, whereas AHPs elicited every 150 s were stable. Blockade of the apamin-sensitive AHP current (I(AHP)) was insufficient to block AHP plasticity, suggesting that plasticity is manifested through changes in the apamin-insensitive slow AHP current (sI(AHP)). These changes were observed in the presence of synaptic blockers, and therefore reflect changes in the intrinsic properties of the neurons. However, no AHP plasticity was observed using KMeth. In summary, these data show that KMeth produces time-dependent changes in basic membrane properties and prevents or obscures activity-dependent reduction of the AHP. In whole-cell recordings using KGluc, repetitive theta-burst firing induced AHP plasticity that mimics learning-related reduction in the AHP.
ABCA3 is a member of the ATP Binding Cassette family of proteins, transporters that hydrolyze ATP in order to move substrates across biological membranes. Mutations in the gene encoding ABCA3 have been found in children with severe neonatal respiratory disease and older children with some forms of interstitial lung disease. This review summarizes current knowledge concerning clinical, genetic, and pathologic features of the lung disease associated with mutations in the ABCA3 gene, and also briefly reviews some other forms of childhood interstitial lung diseases that have their antecedents in the neonatal period and may also have a genetic basis.
CS (chitosan) has emerged as a promising non-viral vector for gene delivery because of its ability to form complexes with pDNA (plasmid DNA) and enhance its transport across cellular membranes through endocytosis. Complexes of CS and pDNA may improve transfection efficiency; however, they are not capable of sustained DNA release and prolonging gene transfer. In order to achieve prolonged delivery of CS-DNA complexes, we prepared CS NP (nanoparticle) and CS-DNA complexes. alpha-Methoxy-omega-succinimidylpoly(ethylene glycol) was then conjugated to the surface of CS-DNA complexes using an active ester scheme; finally, the potential of PEGylation [poly(ethylene glycol)ylation] of CS NP as a non-viral gene-delivery vector to transfer exogenous genes in vitro and in vivo were examined. Electrophoretic analysis suggested that CS NPs could protect the DNA from nuclease degradation. The pDNA carried by CS NPs could enter and be expressed in HepG2 cells. However, the transfection efficiency was very low and the highest dose of DNA transferred was 1.6 microg. The transfection activities of CS-DNA-PEG were preserved and a higher dose (2.4 microg) of pDNA was transferred. This indicated that the transfection efficiency of the PEGylated complexes had been improved. In vivo experiments also showed that CS-DNA-PEG complexes mediated higher gene expression in tissues than did CS-DNA complexes, and that gene expression in tumours induced by CS-DNA-PEG complexes was the highest of all. These results suggested that PEGylation of CS-DNA complexes improves non-viral gene delivery in vitro or in vivo and has the potential to deliver therapeutic genes directly into hepatoma tissues.
SLC26A6 (CFEX, PAT1) is an anion exchanger expressed in several tissues including renal proximal tubule, pancreatic duct, small intestine, liver, stomach, and heart. It has recently been reported that PKC activation inhibits A6-mediated Cl/HCO(3) exchange by disrupting binding of carbonic anhydrase to A6. However, A6 can operate in HCO(3)-independent exchange modes of physiological importance, as A6-mediated Cl/oxalate exchange plays important roles in proximal tubule NaCl reabsorption and intestinal oxalate secretion. We therefore examined whether PKC activation affects HCO(3)-independent exchange modes of Slc26a6 functionally expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We found that PKC activation inhibited Cl/formate exchange mediated by Slc26a6 but failed to inhibit the related anion exchanger pendrin (SLC26A4) under identical conditions. PKC activation inhibited Slc26a6-mediated Cl/formate exchange, Cl/oxalate exchange, and Cl/Cl exchange to a similar extent. The inhibitor sensitivity profile and the finding that PMA-induced inhibition was calcium independent suggested a potential role for PKC-delta. Indeed, the PKC-delta-selective inhibitor rottlerin significantly blocked PMA-induced inhibition of Slc26a6 activity. Localization of Slc26a6 by immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that exposure to PKC activation led to redistribution of Slc26a6 from the oocyte plasma membrane to the intracellular compartment immediately below it. We also observed that PMA decreased the pool of Slc26a6 available to surface biotinylation but had no effect on total Slc26a6 expression. The physiological significance of these findings was supported by the observation that PKC activation inhibited mouse duodenal oxalate secretion, an effect blocked by rottlerin. We conclude that multiple modes of anion exchange mediated by Slc26a6 are negatively regulated by PKC-delta activation.
PC cell-derived growth factor is a novel growth factor for tumor formation and progression. No comprehensive literature concerning PC cell-derived growth factor expression status and its biological function in squamous cell carcinoma, especially in the larynx, is, however, available. The target of this study is to evaluate the clinical significance of PC cell-derived growth factor and the potential of small interfering RNA-induced genetic silencing of PC cell-derived growth factor as a supplementary therapeutic way for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. A total of 146 primary laryngeal cancer, 108 adult laryngeal papilloma and 41 laryngeal leukoplakia samples, as well as 10 normal larynx tissues were investigated. The PC cell-derived growth factor mRNA level was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and protein localization by immunohistochemistry. The biological function of PC cell-derived growth factor was assessed by transfection of small interfering RNA PC cell-derived growth factor construction. The PC cell-derived growth factor protein levels and mRNA levels of the laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas were significantly higher than those of normal laryngeal tissues (P<0.001). Simultaneously, the difference in the levels of mRNA and protein between those of laryngeal precancerous lesions (papilloma/leukoplakia) and those of normal tissues was significant (P<0.05, P<0.05), whereas those of laryngeal precancerous lesions (papilloma/leukoplakia) were significantly lower than those of laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas (P<0.05, P<0.05). Strong PC cell-derived growth factor expression was associated with lymph node metastases in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (P<0.05). Functional studies on Hep-2 cell lines demonstrated that the attenuation of PC cell-derived growth factor expression levels led to diminished cell proliferation rates (P<0.001), anchorage-independent growth in vitro (P<0.001), tumor forming in vivo (P<0.01) and resistance to apoptosis (P<0.001). PC cell-derived growth factor is a pivotal autocrine growth factor in the tumorigenesis of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Our findings also indicate that PC cell-derived growth factor is a logical and potential target for early diagnosis, specific therapy and prognosis of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
CYP1A1 and GSTP1 polymorphisms have been associated with a higher risk to develop several cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which is closely related to tobacco and alcohol consumption. Both genes code for enzymes that have an important role in activating or detoxifying carcinogenic elements found in tobacco and other compounds, and polymorphic variants of these genes may result in alterations of the enzymatic activity. The CYP1A1 gene codes for the enzyme aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, which is responsible for the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The investigated polymorphism, Ile/Val, seems to increase the activity of the enzyme in homozygous individuals, leading to an accumulation of carcinogens. The Ile/Val polymorphism occurs because of an A->G transition at exon 7, resulting in the CYP1A1*2B allele. The GSTP1*B variant shows an A->G transition at exon 5, changing the amino acid Ile to Val, with a reduced catalytic activity of the enzyme. Due to this reduction, the carriers of mutant alleles lost the capability to metabolize carcinogens, which could be responsible for a higher susceptibility to cancer. We conducted a case-control study in a group of 72 cases with newly diagnosed OSCC and 60 healthy controls matched for age, gender, smoking habits, and ethnicity. We used PCR methods to identify the allelic variants CYP1A1*2B and GSTP1*B. The data obtained showed no statistically significant association of allelic or genotypic variants of CYP1A1*2B (OR = 1.06; 95% CI = 0.49-2.29) and GSTP1*B (OR = 1.40; 95% CI = 0.70-2.79) with OSCC.
CYP1A2 is involved in the metabolism of both caffeine and propafenone, a class Ic antiarrhythmic agent. Despite the widespread consumption of caffeine, drug-drug interactions with this agent are often overlooked. This study investigated effects of propafenone on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine. Eight healthy volunteers were included in our study. A total of 300 mg of caffeine was given on 2 occasions, once alone and once during the coadministration of 300 mg propafenone. Serial blood samples were collected and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a population pharmacokinetic approach. A one-compartment PK model with first-order absorption and elimination described plasma concentration profiles. Concomitant administration of propafenone decreased caffeine oral clearance from 8.3 +/- 0.9 L/h to 5.4 +/- 0.7 L/h (P < 0.05). Elimination half-life of caffeine was also increased 54% by propafenone. One of our volunteers was a poor metabolizer of CYP2D6. Concomitant administration of propafenone to this volunteer caused the greatest increase in caffeine plasma concentrations. These results support the concept of competitive inhibition between propafenone and caffeine. Our results suggest that propafenone causes significant inhibition of CYP1A2 activity leading to a decrease in the clearance of caffeine. Caffeine has intrinsic proarrhythmic effects; thus, its coadministration with an antiarrhythmic agent such as propafenone should be used with caution, especially in patients with poor CYP2D6 activity.
CYP2D6 is described as the most relevant enzyme in the metabolism of many antipsychotic drugs. Its contribution to the interindividual differences in drug response is reviewed here highlighting its role in the kinetics of antipsychotic drugs and the occurrence of drug interactions. The activity of CYP2D6 is inherited as a monogenetic trait and the CYP2D6 gene appears highly polymorphic in humans. The polymorphic alleles may lead to altered activity of the CYP enzymes causing absent, decreased (poor), or increased (ultrarapid) metabolism that in turn influence the disposition of the antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotic drug biotransformation is mainly determined by genetic factors mediating CYP2D6 gene polymorphism, however the importance of environmental factors (dietary, smoking, diseases, etc.) is also recognized. Additionally, the potential interaction between CYP2D6 and the endogenous metabolism must be taken into consideration. The present review summarizes the relevance of physiological and environmental factors in CYP2D6 hydroxylation capacity, the inhibition of CYP2D6 activity during treatment, the use of drug/metabolite ratio as a tool to evaluate CYP2D6 hydroxylation capacity in a patient, and the relevance of CYP2D6 for drug plasma concentration and for QTc interval lengthening during treatment with antipsychotic drugs.
CYP3A7 is a member of the human CYP3A family and a major form of P450 expressed in human fetal livers. Although CYP3A7 shares nearly 90% base sequence with CYP3A4, CYP3A7 shows striking functional differences in the catalytic preference for several substrates, such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate (DHEA-3S). First, to clarify the reason for the differences between CYP3A7 and CYP3A4, a homology model of CYP3A7 was constructed using the CYP3A4 crystal structure. Because these two structures were similar, four kinds of chimeric enzymes were constructed to determine which sequences are important for exhibiting the characteristics of CYP3A7. The results of kinetic analysis of DHEA and DHEA-3S 16alpha-hydroxylations by CYP3A7, CYP3A4, and CYP3A chimeras suggested that the amino acid residues from Leu(210) to Glu(279) were important to express the specificity for substrates as CYP3A7. This region was on the F and G helices of the modeled CYP3A7. Furthermore, to assess which amino acid in this sequence is important for the substrate specificity of CYP3A7, a one-point mutation of CYP3A7 to CYP3A4 was made by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutants of K224T and K244E had lost DHEA and DHEA-3S 16alpha-hydroxylation activities. The mutants also greatly decreased the metabolism of testosterone, erythromycin, nevirapine, and triazolam relative to those activities of CYP3A7 wild-type enzyme. From these results, it is expected that CYP3A7 can recognize specific substrates using the lysines in F-G loops.
WWOX is a tumor suppressor that functions as a modular protein partner of transcription factors. WWOX contains two WW domains that mediate protein-protein interactions. In this report, we show that WWOX, via its first WW domain, specifically associates with the proline-rich motif of c-Jun proto-oncogene. Our data show that phosphorylation of c-Jun caused by overexpression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (Mekk1), an upstream activator of c-Jun, enhances the interaction of c-Jun with WWOX. Furthermore, exposure of HaCaT keratinocytes to UVC radiation resulted in the association of endogenous WWOX and c-Jun. The WWOX-c-Jun complexes mainly occur in the cytoplasm. Expression of WWOX attenuates the ability of MEKK1 to increase the activity of a c-Jun-driven activating protein-1 (AP-1)-luciferase reporter plasmid. In contrast, a point mutation in the first WW domain of WWOX has no effect on transactivation of AP-1 when coexpressed with c-Jun protein. Our findings reveal a novel functional cross-talk between c-Jun transcription factor and WWOX tumor suppressor protein.
CYP1A1 activates environmental procarcinogens and catalyzes oxidative metabolism of estrogens and is likely to play an important role in the etiology of prostate cancer. To evaluate this phenomenon, the association between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (A to G transition in exon7 leading to amino acid substitution Ile462Val and T3801C at 3'UTR) of CYP1A1 gene in prostate cancer were analyzed in a case-control study of 100 individuals in South Indian population. The estimated relative risk was significantly high for individuals with w1/m1 genotype at 3'UTR of CYP1A1 gene (OR-4.64; 95%CI = 1.51-14.86; P < 0.01) whereas the CYP1A1 Ile/Val genotype (w2/m2) on exon 7 was found to be associated with a decreased risk for prostate cancer (OR-0.17; 95%CI = 0.02-0.89; P=0.03). A Stratified analysis of the genotypes with age of onset and tumor grade showed the w1/m1 genotype to be significantly associated with an early age of onset; however the tumor grades did not have significant association with the variant genotypes. Thus the present study indicates that individuals with the variant w1/m1 genotype exhibit an increased risk while those with w2/m2 genotype exhibit a decreased risk for prostate cancer.
CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 expression is up-regulated by activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) through binding of ligands such as cigarette smoke components. We examined the association between AhR, CYP1B1, and CYP1A1 expression in noninvasive bronchioloalveolar carcinomas (BAC) and lung adenocarcinomas and investigated the effects of AhR overexpression on cell physiology.
CYP3A4 has unusual kinetic characteristics because it has a large active site. CYP3A4 produced more 4-hydroxytriazolam than alpha-hydroxytriazolam at concentrations of more than 60 muM triazolam, and different steroids had different inhibitory effects on the system. To clarify these interesting observations, the interactions between substrate and substrate/steroid were investigated by theoretical calculations. When two triazolam molecules were docked into the active site, the distance between the O-atom and the 4-hydroxylated site was less than the distance to the alpha-hydroxylated site because of interaction between the two triazolam molecules. Estradiol inhibited both alpha- and 4-hydroxytriazolam formation by 50%. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) inhibited alpha-hydroxylation more than 4-hydroxytriazolam formation, whereas aldosterone had no effect. When one triazolam molecule and one steroid molecule were simultaneously docked, estradiol increased the distance between the O-atom and the two hydroxylated sites, DHEA only increased the distance between the O-atom and alpha-hydroxylated site, and aldosterone did not change the distances. The relevant angles of Fe-O-C in the hydroxylated site of triazolam also widened, together with increased distance. These findings indicate that formation of a substrate and substrate/effector complex in the active site may be a factor for determining the enzyme kinetic parameters of CYP3A4.
UGT1A8 and UGT2B7 are important uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms for the glucuronidation of mycophenolic acid (MPA). The aim of this investigation was to elucidate MPA pharmacokinetics in UGT1A8 and UGT2B7 genotypes in Japanese renal transplant recipients.
CYP2B6 is the primary enzyme involved in bupropion (Zyban; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) metabolism. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2B6, such as CYP2B6*6, can alter bupropion metabolism and may affect bupropion treatment outcome.
PHOSPHO1 is a phosphatase highly expressed in bone. We studied its functional involvement in mineralization through the use of novel small molecule inhibitors. PHOSPHO1 expression was present within matrix vesicles, and inhibition of enzyme action caused a decrease in the ability of matrix vesicles to calcify.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is a tumour suppressor that functions as a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 3-phosphatase to inhibit cell proliferation, survival and growth by antagonizing PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-dependent signalling. Recent work has begun to focus attention on potential biological functions of the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN and on the possibility that some of its functions are phosphatase-independent. We discuss here the structural and regulatory mechanisms that account for the remarkable specificity of PTEN with respect to its PtdIns substrates and how it avoids the soluble headgroups of PtdIns that occur commonly in cells. Secondly we discuss the concept of PTEN as a constitutively active enzyme that is subject to negative regulation both physiologically and pathologically. Thirdly, we review the evidence that PTEN functions as a dual specificity phosphatase with discrete lipid and protein substrates. Lastly we present a current model of how PTEN may participate in the control of cell migration.
"ALAD porphyria is a rare porphyric disorder, with five documented compound heterozygous patients, and it is caused by a profound lack of porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS) activity. PBGS, also called ""delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase,"" is encoded by the ALAD gene and catalyzes the second step in the biosynthesis of heme. ALAD porphyria is a recessive disorder; there are two common variant ALAD alleles, which encode K59 and N59, and eight known porphyria-associated ALAD mutations, which encode F12L, E89K, C132R, G133R, V153M, R240W, A274T, and V275M. Human PBGS exists as an equilibrium of functionally distinct quaternary structure assemblies, known as ""morpheeins,"" in which one functional homo-oligomer can dissociate, change conformation, and reassociate into a different oligomer. In the case of human PBGS, the two assemblies are a high-activity octamer and a low-activity hexamer. The current study quantifies the morpheein forms of human PBGS for the common and porphyria-associated variants. Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, followed by separation of the octameric and hexameric assemblies on an ion-exchange column, showed that the percentage of hexamer for F12L (100%), R240W (80%), G133R (48%), C132R (36%), E89K (31%), and A274T (14%) was appreciably larger than for the wild-type proteins K59 and N59 (0% and 3%, respectively). All eight porphyria-associated variants, including V153M and V275M, showed an increased propensity to form the hexamer, according to a kinetic analysis. Thus, all porphyria-associated human PBGS variants are found to shift the morpheein equilibrium for PBGS toward the less active hexamer. We propose that the disequilibrium of morpheein assemblies broadens the definition of conformational diseases beyond the prion disorders and that ALAD porphyria is the first example of a morpheein-based conformational disease."
CYP27B1 is a critical enzyme of Vitamin D biosynthesis that hydroxylates 25(OH)D(3) at the final step of the biosynthetic pathway. The CYP27B1 gene is expressed primarily in kidney and negatively controlled by Vitamin D receptor. We have characterized the negative vitamin D response element and its binding protein, a bHLH transcription factor. This factor directly binds to the 1alphanVDRE and activates transcription, but its transcriptional activity is suppressed by the ligand-activated Vitamin D receptor through recruitment of histone deacetylase. We have shown that histone deacetylation is a critical step for chromatin structure remodeling in suppression of the CYP27B1 gene. We have further demonstrated that, in addition to histone acetylation, this transrepression by VDR requires DNA methylation in the CYP27B1 gene promoter. Thus, transcriptional regulation of the CYP27B1 gene appears to be mediated by dual epigenetic modifications.
ELOVL4 was first identified as a disease-causing gene in Stargardt macular dystrophy (STGD3, MIM 600110.) To date, three ELOVL4 mutations have been identified, all of which result in truncated proteins which induce autosomal dominant juvenile macular degenerations. Based on sequence homology, ELOVL4 is thought to be another member within a family of proteins functioning in the elongation of long chain fatty acids. However, the normal function of ELOVL4 is unclear. We generated Elovl4 knockout mice to determine if Elovl4 loss affects retinal development or function. Here we show that Elovl4 knockout mice, while perinatal lethal, exhibit normal retinal development prior to death at day of birth. Further, postnatal retinal development in Elovl4 heterozygous mice appears normal. Therefore haploinsufficiency for wildtype ELOVL4 in autosomal dominant macular degeneration likely does not contribute to juvenile macular degeneration in STGD3 patients. We found, however, that Elovl4+/- mice exhibit enhanced ERG scotopic and photopic a and b waves relative to wildtype Elovl4+/+ mice suggesting that reduced Elovl4 levels may impact retinal electrophysiological responses.
NOS3 and MPO genes encode endothelial nitric oxide synthase and myeloperoxidase (MPO), respectively, which generate nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species. Because cigarette smoking generates reactive species, we hypothesized that NOS3 and MPO polymorphisms could influence susceptibility to breast cancer, particularly among smokers. We examined the associations between NOS3 Glu298Asp and MPO G-463A polymorphisms and breast cancer risk by cigarette smoking among post-menopausal women in the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort. Included in this analysis were 502 women who provided blood samples and were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1992 and 2001 and 505 cancer-free controls who were matched to the cases by age, race/ethnicity and date of blood donation. Genotyping for NOS3 and MPO was performed using TaqMan, and unconditional logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). No statistically significant relationships were found between NOS3 and MPO genotypes and breast cancer risk. When considering smoking, variant NOS3 genotypes (GT and TT) were significantly associated with reduced breast cancer risk among never smokers (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.45-0.99), but were associated with higher risk among ever smokers (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.05-2.41) and 2-fold increase in risk for those who smoked >10 cigarettes per day (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.21-3.97). NOS3 genotypes appeared to be associated with risk of post-menopausal breast cancer among smokers, supporting the hypothesis that subgroups of women based upon genetic profiles may be at higher risk of breast cancer when exposed to tobacco smoke.
PC cell-derived growth factor (PCDGF), also called epithelin/granulin precursor (GEP), is an 88-kDa secreted glycoprotein with the ability to stimulate cell proliferation in an autocrine fashion. In addition, some studies indicated that PCDGF participated in invasion, metastasis and survival of cancer cells by regulating cell migration, adhesion and proliferation. Yet the effects of PCDGF on proliferation and invasion of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and the mechanisms by which PCDGF mediates biological behaviors of ovarian cancer have rarely been reported. In the present study we investigated whether and how PCDGF/GEP mediated cell proliferation and invasion in ovarian cancer.
ABCA3 protein is expressed predominantly at the limiting membrane of the lamellar bodies in alveolar type II cells, and mutations in the ABCA3 gene cause lethal respiratory distress in newborn infants. To investigate the function of ABCA3 protein, we generated Abca3-deficient mice by targeting Abca3. Full-term Abca3(-/-) newborn pups died within an hour after birth because of acute respiratory failure. Ultrastructural analysis revealed abnormally dense lamellar body-like organelles and no normal lamellar bodies in Abca3(-/-) alveolar type II cells. TLC and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analyses of lipids in the pulmonary interstitium showed that phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol, which contain palmitic acid and are abundant in normal surfactant lipids, were dramatically decreased in Abca3(-/-) lung. These findings indicate that ABCA3 plays an essential role in pulmonary surfactant lipid metabolism and lamellar body biogenesis, probably by transporting these lipids as substrates.
RALBP1 (RLIP76) is the major transporter of doxorubicin (DOX) in lung cancer cells, and that the difference in sensitivity of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells to DOX is due to differential phosphorylation by PKCalpha. Our recent studies have suggested that RALBP1 present in MCF-7 breast cancer cells has significantly lower specific activity for transport of DOX than wild-type recombinant protein, and its level of expression is significantly lower than that in lung cancer cells. In the present study, we have explored whether or not this is a generalized phenomenon for breast cancer, and have compared the relative contributions of RALBP1 and the ABC-family transporter, ABCG2 to total DOX transport activities in two SCLC (H1417 and H1618), two non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (H358 and H520), and three breast cancer (T-47D, MDA-MB231, and MCF-7) cell lines. Results of these studies show lower protein expression and specific activity of RALBP1 in all three breast cancer cell lines as compared with lung cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RALBP1 contributes only a minor fraction of DOX transport activity in breast cancer cell lines, suggesting that greater DOX sensitivity of breast cancer may be related to lower RALBP1 transporter activity and that the transport mechanisms involved in multidrug resistance of lung and breast cancer are distinct.
GPI membrane anchors of cell surface glycoproteins have been shown to confer functional properties that are different from their transmembrane (TM)-anchored counterparts. For the human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family, a subfamily of the immunoglobulin superfamily, conversion of the mode of membrane linkage from TM to GPI confers radical changes in function: from tumor suppression or neutrality toward inhibition of differentiation and anoikis and distortion of tissue architecture, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis. We show here that GPI anchorage in the CEA family evolved twice independently in primates, very likely from more primitive TM anchors, by different packages of mutations. Both mutational packages, one package found in many primates, including humans, and a second, novel package found only in the Cebidae radiation of New World monkeys, give rise to efficiently processed GPI-linked proteins. Both types of GPI anchors mediate inhibition of cell differentiation. The estimated rate of nonsynonymous mutations (Ka) in the anchor-determining domain for conversion from TM to GPI anchorage in the CEA family that were fixed during evolution in these primates is 7 times higher than the average Ka in primates, indicating positive selection. These results suggest therefore that the functional changes mediated by CEA GPI anchors, including the inhibition of differentiation and anoikis, could be adaptive and advantageous.
CD38 expression is an important prognostic marker in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with high levels of CD38 associated with shorter overall survival. In this study, we used gene expression profiling and protein analysis of highly purified cell-sorted CD38(+) and CD38(-) chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to elucidate a molecular basis for the association between CD38 expression and inferior clinical outcome. Paired CD38(+) and CD38(-) CLL cells derived from the same patient were shown to be monoclonal by V(H) gene sequencing but despite this, CD38(+) CLL cells possessed a distinct gene expression profile when compared with their CD38(-) sub-clones. Importantly, CD38(+) CLL cells relatively over expressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and appeared to preferentially utilize an internal autocrine VEGF survival loop. Elevated VEGF expression was associated with increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Inhibition of VEGF receptor signaling also resulted in a reduction in cell viability. In contrast, exogenous VEGF caused a significant increase in CD38(-) CLL cell viability and a marked induction of Mcl-1; both effects were less obvious in CD38(+) CLL cells. Taken together, our data provide a biological rationale for the poor prognosis of CD38(+) CLL and indicate that both VEGF and Mcl-1 may prove to be useful therapeutic targets.
CYP27A1 catalyzes vitamin D(3) 25-hydroxylation and further hydroxylation at C-1alpha, C-24 or C-26(27). Molecular modeling of human CYP27A1 and docking with 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) predicted that Gln 85 might be important for 1alpha-hydroxylation activity of CYP27A1 by forming a hydrogen bond with the 25-OH group of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3). Expectedly, the mutant Q85H expressed in Escherichia coli showed no detectable 1alpha-hydroxylation activity toward 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3). In addition, Q85H prefers 24-hydroxylation toward 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) whereas the wild-type prefers 26(27)-hydroxylation. A molecular modeling study also suggests that Gln 85 of CYP27A1 simultaneously interacts with Asn 107 and the hydroxyl group of the substrate. The fact that Q85L did not contain a heme molecule suggests that the hydrogen bond between Gln 85 and Asn 107 is important for protein folding of CYP27A1. Based on these results, it is possible that Gln 85 plays essential roles in both substrate-binding and protein folding.
CYP3A4 is the most abundantly expressed drug-metabolizing P450 enzyme in human liver and contributes to the metabolism of a large number of drugs in use today. CYP3A4 is constitutively expressed in adult hepatocytes but it can also be transcriptionally induced by a variety of structurally diverse xenochemicals. CYP3A4 strongly contributes to the important variability in the therapeutic and toxic effects of drugs owing to the major role it plays in xenobiotic metabolism and the large intra- and inter-individual variability to which it is subjected. The functional examination of up to 13 kb of the CYP3A4 5'-flanking region has revealed that the regulation of this gene is a complex issue, with numerous transcription factors interacting with multiple promoter/enhancer elements. This also suggests that a high degree of human variability in the hepatic CYP3A4 expression could result from regulatory polymorphisms. Several transcription factors and nuclear receptors contribute to the hepatic-specific expression of CYP3A4, including: C/EBPalpha, C/EBPbeta, HNF4alpha, HNF3gamma, CAR and PXR. The induction phenomenon and the down-regulation of CYP3A4 in pathophysiological conditions, such as inflammatory situations, are key processes involved in the toxic vs. therapeutic effects of many drugs. Since CYP3A4 variation may affect the efficacy and toxicity of new drugs, development of reliable hepatic models for the assessment and prediction of the role of CYP3A4 in drug metabolism are important for drug development. Cultured human hepatocytes are the closest model to the human liver as far as CYP3A4 regulation and induction are concerned. However, other hepatic models should be considered in drug development for screening purposes owing to the limited availability of human hepatocytes.
CYP2D6 is a member of cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolise over 25% of commonly used drugs. Genetic polymorphisms can cause insufficient drug efficacy at usually administered doses or can be the cause of adverse drug reaction. CYP2D6 genotyping can be used to predict CYP2D6 phenotype and thereby explain some abnormalities in drug response and thus optimize pharmacotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of functionally important variant alleles of the CYP2D6 gene throughout the Czech population to predict the prevalence of ultra-rapid and poor metabolizer phenotypes. The DNA of 223 unrelated, healthy volunteers was analysed to detect the presence of CYP2D6*6, *5, *4, *3 and gene duplication. The variant allele frequencies in our population were 0.22%, 3.14%, 22.87%, 1.12% and 3.14% for CYP2D6*6, CYP2D6*5, CYP2D6*4, CYP2D6*3 and CYP2D6*MxN, respectively. Fifteen subjects carried two variant alleles leading to predicted poor type of metabolism, 84 subjects were heterozygous extensive metabolizers (het-EM). The full-text contains detailed comparison with European white populations. The distribution of variant alleles complies with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequencies of functional variant alleles of CYP2D6 in Czech population are in concordance with other Caucasian populations.
ACE inhibitors or AT(1) antagonists are powerful therapeutic strategies to slow the progression of renal disease. However, they provide only imperfect protection since they cannot always prevent end-stage renal failure. Innovative approaches are needed to keep patients with chronic kidney disease off dialysis. Blockade of the aldosterone pathway may prove to be such a beneficial therapeutic concept.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently mutated in type I endometrioid endometrial carcinomas (EECs), and is involved in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In this study, we aimed to assess the relationship between PTEN expression and estrogen, progesterone receptors (PRs), other apoptosis-related proteins, such as bcl-2 and bax, and apoptotic index (AI) in EEC, its precursor lesion hyperplasia, and cyclical endometrium. We also evaluated the relationship between PTEN expression and clinicopathologic parameters. PTEN, estrogen receptor (ER), PR, and bcl-2 and bax expressions were evaluated immunohistochemically, and AI was evaluated in hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained slides in 23 cyclical and 37 hyperplastic endometria and in 35 EECs. PTEN expression was higher in cyclical endometrium than in the carcinomas (p<0.05). The PTEN expression level was significantly higher in non-atypical hyperplasias than in EEC, but there were no differences between atypical complex hyperplasia (ACH) and EEC and between hyperplasias. In the carcinomas, there was a negative correlation between grade and PTEN expression (r=-0.338, p=0.047). In conclusion, we presume that PTEN is involved in the early phases of endometrial tumorigenesis, and it can be speculated that decreased PTEN expression with loss of differentiation in carcinoma can contribute to the emergence of tumors with a more aggressive phenotype.
PTEN exerts its tumour suppressor function by dephosphorylating the phospholipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP(3)). Herein, we demonstrate that the PTEN-catalysed PIP(3) dephosphorylation reaction involves two-steps: (i) formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate (PE) in which Cys-124 in the active site is thiophosphorylated, and (ii) hydrolysis of PE. For protein tyrosine- and dual-specificity phosphatases, catalysis requires the participation of a conserved active site aspartate as the general acid in Step 1. Its mutation to alanine severely limits PE formation. However, mutation of the homologous Asp-92 in PTEN does not significantly limit PE formation, indicating that Asp-92 does not act as the general acid. G129E is a common germline PTEN mutations found in Cowden syndrome patients. Mechanistic analysis reveals that this mutation inactivates PTEN by both significantly slowing down Step 1 and abolishing the ability to catalyse Step 2. Taken together, our results highlight the mechanistic similarities and differences between PTEN and the conventional protein phosphatases and reveal how a disease-associated mutation inactivates PTEN.
CYP2D6 has been suggested to be functionally similar to the dopamine transporter. The present study was aimed at analysing the frequency of CYP2D6 alleles and genotype among schizophrenic patients compared to healthy volunteers. CYP2D6 *3, *4, *5, *6, *10 and duplicated alleles were analysed in 128 unselected schizophrenia inpatients (SP) and 142 unrelated white European Spanish healthy volunteers (HV). SP and HV with >2, 2, 1 or 0 CYP2D6 active genes were 4.7, 64.8, 28.1 and 2.3%, and 6.3, 52.1, 33.1 and 8.5%, respectively. The frequency of homozygous for CYP2D6 inactive alleles or poor metabolizers (PMs) was lower (P<0.05) in SP than in HV. Furthermore, the frequency of CYP2D6 inactive alleles was also lower in SP than in HV (16.8 vs 25.7; P<0.05), specifically the CYP2D6*6 allele was not found among patients. The present study shows a lower frequency of PMs in schizophrenic patients than in healthy volunteers supporting the hypothesis of a potential role of CYP2D6 in the vulnerability to schizophrenia.
CYP2C9 is one of the major drug-metabolizing enzymes, and it is involved in the oxidative metabolism of approximately 10% of clinically important drugs, among which some, such as the anticoagulant warfarin, have a narrow therapeutic index. The human CYP2C9 gene is highly polymorphic. We found a new sequence variation in exon 7 of the CYP2C9 gene (1060G>A) resulting in a substitution of acidic amino acid glutamate to basic lysine (E354K) when translated. The allele, designated CYP2C9(*)24, was present in heterozygous state in one warfarin-treated patient. To characterize the CYP2C9(*)24 allele, we expressed the wild-type and CYP2C9.24 protein in a recombinant yeast expression system and a human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cell system. Carbon monoxide difference spectra were recorded on dithionite-reduced microsomes, and protein was determined by Western blotting. Transfection with CYP2C9.1 cDNA resulted in detectable CYP2C9 protein in yeast or HEK-293 cells, whereas only small amounts of the protein were detected in yeast transfected with CYP2C9.24 cDNA. A strong differential absorption peak at 450 nm was observed with microsomes of yeast transfected with CYP2C9.1 cDNA, whereas no peak was detected with microsomes of yeast transfected with CYP2C9.24 cDNA or empty pYeDP60 plasmid. These results suggest that CYP2C9.24 may be improperly folded, both in yeast and mammalian cells, resulting in improper heme incorporation and rapid intracellular degradation. The data obtained in the expression systems are consistent with our findings in vivo. In conclusion, we have identified a novel defective CYP2C9 variant allele of potential importance for drug metabolism in vivo.
CD36 is a scavenger receptor that has been implicated in malaria pathogenesis as well as innate defense against blood-stage infection. Inflammatory responses to Plasmodium falciparum GPI (pfGPI) anchors are believed to play an important role in innate immune response to malaria. We investigated the role of CD36 in pfGPI-induced MAPK activation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Furthermore, we explored the role of this receptor in an experimental model of acute malaria in vivo. We demonstrate that ERK1/2, JNK, p38, and c-Jun became phosphorylated in pfGPI-stimulated macrophages. In contrast, pfGPI-induced phosphorylation of JNK, ERK1/2, and c-Jun was reduced in Cd36(-/-) macrophages and Cd36(-/-) macrophages secreted significantly less TNF-alpha in response to pfGPI than their wild-type counterparts. In addition, we demonstrate a role for CD36 in innate immune response to malaria in vivo. Compared with wild-type mice, Cd36(-/-) mice experienced more severe and fatal malaria when challenged with Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi AS. Cd36(-/-) mice displayed a combined defect in cytokine induction and parasite clearance with a dysregulated cytokine response to infection, earlier peak parasitemias, higher parasite densities, and higher mortality rates than wild-type mice. These results provide direct evidence that pfGPI induces TNF-alpha secretion in a CD36-dependent manner and support a role for CD36 in modulating host cytokine response and innate control of acute blood-stage malaria infection in vivo.
PTEN and beta-catenin are the most common genes for which genetic abnormalities are found in endometrioid adenocarcinoma (type I) and even in their precursors. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) classifies endometrial hyperplasia as a premalignant disease. However, one of the problems in the current WHO endometrial hyperplasia schema is that it is not always a reproducible classification system. Subsequently, the alternative molecular genetics and morphometric-based classification, referred to as the endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) classification system, has been proposed. We reclassified endometrial lesions in Japanese women using the EIN category and compared them with the results of PTEN as well as beta-catenin immunohistochemistry. A total of 117 cases that were initially diagnosed as endometrial hyperplasia according to WHO classification were reevaluated histopathologically by the EIN diagnosis category. They were classified into 38 EIN and 32 benign architectural changes of unopposed estrogen (BAC), and 47 cases were excluded. In addition, for comparison, we examined 20 cases of normal proliferative endometrium (NPE). Subsequently, the expressions of PTEN and beta-catenin were analyzed immunohistochemically. Glandular epithelium was positive for PTEN in all the cases of NPE (20/20), whereas 12.5% (4/32) of BAC and 34.2% (13/38) of EIN were PTEN-null (negative). Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia was significantly less frequently positive for PTEN than NPE (P < .025). The nuclear staining for beta-catenin was seen in 26.3% (10/38) of EIN cases, and the intensity was generally strong. Instead, none of the BAC or NPE showed positive nuclear staining. Thus, the nuclear staining was statistically more frequently seen in EIN than in the other 2 categories (P < .025 for each). In addition, 22 of 38 EIN cases (57.9%) were either PTEN-negative or nuclear beta-catenin-positive. This combination was statistically significantly more frequently seen than BAC (4/32, 12.5%) (P < .001) and NPE (0/20, 0%) (P < .0001). Immunohistochemical loss of PTEN and positive nuclear staining of beta-catenin were frequently seen in EIN but were not seen in NPE cases in Japanese women. The combination of PTEN-negative/beta-catenin-positive results may become the reliable marker for detecting EIN.
ABO incompatibility and positive cross match between the donor and the recipient are no longer considered absolute counter indications to renal transplantation. One-year and 5-years graft survival are similar to ABO compatible transplantation, although a higher incidence of acute humoral rejection is observed. Calcineurin inhibitors nephrotoxicity can be reduced since the introduction of new immunosuppressive drugs. Two forms of peritoneal dialysis are available: continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and automated peritoneal dialysis. In each situation the treatment must be tailored to the patient. Various clinical and biological parameters allow to judge the adequacy of the peritoneal dialysis. The last guidelines fixed the minimal target value of one of them, the Kt/V, at 1.7.
CYP2D6 is a highly polymorphic phase I enzyme that metabolizes 20%-25% of clinically used drugs. The objective of this study was to validate a CYP2D6 genotyping assay with the NanoChip Molecular Biology Workstation.
G6PD deficiency is the most common metabolic disorder of red blood cells, involving about 35 million people worldwide. Tropical and subtropical regions in the eastern hemisphere have the highest prevalence, up to 35% in some areas. The prevalence varies in different parts of the world. According to WHO, there is a 10-14.9% prevalence of G6PD deficiency in Iran. With this high prevalence, blood products are not still checked for G6PD deficiency. So, they may be used for transfusion in neonates with jaundice or for patients using oxidants. In this cross-sectional study, we have observed the effects of using this kind of blood in patients receiving blood in the Pediatric and Neonatology Departments of Imam Sajjad's Hospital in Yasuj. Samples were taken from 261 blood bags used for transfusion or exchange, and examined by spot fluorescence for G6PD deficiency. All of the patients receiving blood were examined for hemoglobin, hematocrit, and bilirubin before and after transfusion. They were also examined for hemoglobinuria, factors involved in hemolysis due to G6PD deficiency, and oxidants.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is an important tumour-suppressor gene that encodes a 3-phosphatase. The major substrate of PTEN is PIP(3) (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate) generated by the action of PI3Ks (phosphoinositide 3-kinases). Hereditary mutation of PTEN causes tumour-susceptibility diseases such as Cowden disease. We used the Cre-loxP system to generate an endothelial cell-specific mutation of PTEN in mice. Heterozygous mutation of PTEN in endothelial cells enhances postnatal neovascularization, including tumour angiogenesis necessary for tumour growth. This observation suggests that Cowden disease patients are not only at risk for additional tumorigenic mutations due to complete loss of PTEN function, but may also experience accelerated growth of incipient tumours due to enhanced angiogenesis. Homozygous mutation of Pten in murine endothelial cells impairs cardiovascular morphogenesis and is embryonic lethal due to endothelial cell hyperproliferation and impaired vascular remodelling. Additional homozygous mutation of p85alpha, the regulatory subunit of class IA PI3Ks, or p110gamma, the catalytic subunit of the sole class IB PI3K, led to a partial rescue of all phenotypes in our PTEN-deficient mice. Thus inhibition of the PI3K pathway, including the targeting of PI3Kgamma, may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of various malignancies.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is well known as a tumour suppressor. In dephosphorylating the 3-position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides such as PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), PTEN's lipid phosphatase activity is an important counteracting mechanism in PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) signalling. This is essential for cell motility and migration due to the achievement of a PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)/PtdIns(4,5)P(2) gradient that is also involved in metastasis. Furthermore, PTEN's tumour suppressor role is linked to the control of cell-cycle progression and cell proliferation by counteracting Akt (also called protein kinase B) signalling which is PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)-dependent. Akt is upstream of several kinases involved in proliferation and apoptotic signalling which are often found to be deregulated or mutated in tumours. However, Akt is also the key enzyme in insulin signalling regulating glucose uptake and cell growth. Therefore PTEN has recently moved into the spotlight as a drug target in diabetes. This review summarizes studies undertaken on PTEN's role in glucose uptake, insulin resistance, diabetes and its controversial role in GLUT (glucose transporter)-mediated glucose uptake. Currently available techniques for inhibiting PTEN and the suitability of PTEN as a drug target will be discussed.
PTEN is an important tumor-suppressor gene associated with many cancers. Through expression profiling of glioblastoma tissue samples and prostate cancer xenografts, we identified a molecular signature for loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor in glioblastoma and prostate tumors. The PTEN signature consists of a minimum of nine genes, several of which are involved in various pathways already implicated in tumor formation. Among these signature genes, the most significant was an increase in insulin growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2) mRNA. Up-regulation of IGFBP-2 was confirmed at the protein level by Western blot analysis and validated in samples not included in the microarray analysis. The link between IGFBP-2 and PTEN was of particular interest because elevated serum IGFBP-2 levels have been reported in patients with prostate and brain tumors. To further investigate this link, we determined that IGFBP-2 expression is negatively regulated by PTEN and positively regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt activation. In addition, Akt-driven transformation is impaired in IGFBP2(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts, implicating a functional role for IGFBP-2 in PTEN signaling. Collectively, these studies establish that PTEN and IGFBP-2 expression are inversely correlated in human brain and prostate cancers and implicate serum IGFBP-2 levels as a potential serum biomarker of PTEN status and PI3K Akt pathway activation in cancer patients.
SLC11A1 is known to link infections, autoimmunity and cancers. A review is presented of the mechanisms by which a balance is maintained between infections caused by pathogens (viral, bacterial and protozoan; intracellular and extracellular) and disorders resulting from (acute or chronic) inflammation, and of the interactions that determine how the initial innate immune system directs subsequent acquired immune responses in human populations.
CD38 is a novel multifunctional protein that serves not only as an antigen but also as an enzyme. It catalyzes the metabolism of cyclic ADP-ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate, two structurally and functionally distinct Ca(2+) messengers targeting, respectively, the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomal Ca(2+) stores. The protein has recently been crystallized and its three-dimensional structure solved to a resolution of 1.9 A. The crystal structure of a binary complex reveals critical interactions between residues at the active site and a bound substrate, providing mechanistic insights to its novel multi-functional catalysis. This article reviews the current advances in the understanding of the structural determinants that control the multiple enzymatic reactions catalyzed by CD38.
CYP2E1 is widely accepted as the sole form of cytochrome P450 responsible for alcohol-mediated increases in acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity. However, we previously found that alcohol [ethanol and isopentanol (EIP)] causes increases in APAP hepatotoxicity in Cyp2e1(-/-) mice, indicating that CYP2E1 is not essential. Here, using wild-type and Cyp2e1(-/-) mice, we investigated the relative roles of CYP2E1 and CYP3A in EIP-mediated increases in APAP hepatotoxicity. We found that EIP-mediated increases in APAP hepatotoxicity occurred at lower APAP doses in wild-type mice (300 mg/kg) than in Cyp2e1(-/-) mice (600 mg/kg). Although this result suggests that CYP2E1 has a role in the different susceptibilities of these mouse lines, our findings that EIP-mediated increases in CYP3A activities were greater in wild-type mice compared with Cyp2e1(-/-) mice raises the possibility that differential increases in CYP3A may also contribute to the greater APAP sensitivity in EIP-pretreated wild-type mice. At the time of APAP administration, which followed an 11 h withdrawal from the alcohols, alcohol-induced levels of CYP3A were sustained in both mouse lines, whereas CYP2E1 was decreased to constitutive levels in wild-type mice. The CYP3A inhibitor triacetyloleandomycin (TAO) decreased APAP hepatotoxicity in EIP-pretreated wild-type and Cyp2e1(-/-) mice. TAO treatment in vivo resulted in inhibition of microsomal CYP3A-catalyzed activity, measured in vitro, with no inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 activities. In conclusion, these findings suggest that both CYP3A and CYP2E1 contribute to APAP hepatotoxicity in alcohol-treated mice.
ABO blood group is a genetic determinant of von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels. We investigated the effect of ABO genotypes on VWF and factor VIII (FVIII) levels and on the degree to which VWF is loaded with A- and B-antigens, expressed as normalized ratios, nA-ratio and nB-ratio, respectively, in the Leiden Thrombophilia Study, a large case-control study on venous thrombosis. We found that the ABO locus had an allele-specific, dosage dependent effect on VWF and FVIII levels and on the loading of VWF with A-antigen and B-antigen. The highest mean nA- and nB-ratios were found in A(1)A(1) and BB genotypes, respectively. Four A(1)O carriers had four 43-bp repeats in the minisatellite region of the ABO gene in stead of the expected one repeat. All had a reduced nA-ratio compared to A(1)O carriers with one repeat in their A(1) allele. The amount of A- and B-antigens expressed onVWF (nA-ratio and nB-ratio) explained about 18% (R(2)) of the variation in VWF levels.
PTEN is an ubiquitously expressed tumor suppressor which plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of many types of sporadic solid tumors, including breast cancer, as well as hematologic malignancies. Germline PTEN mutations cause 85% of Cowden syndrome (CS), characterized by a high risk of breast and thyroid cancers, and 65% of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), characterized by lipomatosis, hemangiomas and speckled penis. Historically, PTEN's role in tumor suppression has been linked to the down-regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by PTEN's lipid phosphatase activity. Beyond the AKT pathway, however, there has been minimal examination of PTEN's responsibility in lipid-derived cellular signaling. As phospholipids have been shown to be critical components in signal transduction and cellular proliferation and PTEN controls cellular phospholipid levels, we hypothesized that PTEN functions as a regulator of lipid signaling and homeostasis. Increased PTEN expression in unstimulated MCF-7 breast cancer cells results in a 51% increase in phosphatidic acid, with a decrease in phosphatidylcholine, suggesting that PTEN may regulate phospholipase D (PLD). PTEN overexpression results in a 30% increase in basal PLD activity. As phospholipase C (PLC) is both involved in PLD activation and is regulated by PIP2/3 levels, we investigated the role of PTEN on PLC activation. Our data suggest that PTEN modulates PLC:PLD activation pathways and indicate that the pathogenesis of CS/BRRS has a more complex biochemical basis beyond simply activating the PI3K pathway. This provides alternative routes for PTEN's tumor suppressor action that may be beneficial in the creation of novel targets for cancer therapy and prevention.
PC (pyruvate carboxylase) plays a crucial role in intermediary metabolism including glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic islets. In the present study, we identified two regions of the 1.2 kb distal promoter, the -803/-795 site and the -408/-403 E-box upstream of the transcription start site, as the important cis-acting elements for transcriptional activation of the luciferase reporter gene. Site-directed mutagenesis of either one of these sites in the context of this 1.2 kb promoter fragment, followed by transient transfections in the insulinoma cell line, INS-1, abolished reporter activity by approx. 50%. However, disruption of either the -803/-795 or the -408/-403 site did not affect reporter gene activity in NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that this promoter fragment is subjected to cell-specific regulation. The nuclear proteins that bound to these -803/-795 and -408/-403 sites were identified by gel retardation assays as HNF3beta (hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta)/Foxa2 (forkhead/winged helix transcription factor box2) and USFs (upstream stimulatory factors), USF1 and USF2, respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using antisera against HNF3beta/Foxa2, USF1 and USF2 demonstrated that endogenous HNF3beta/Foxa2 binds to the -803/-795 Foxa2 site, and USF1 and USF2 bind to the -408/-403 E-box respectively in vivo, consistent with the gel retardation assay results. Although there are weak binding sites located at regions -904 and -572 for PDX1 (pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1), a transcription factor that controls expression of beta-cell-specific genes, it did not appear to regulate PC expression in INS-1 cells in the context of the 1.2 kb promoter fragment. The results presented here show that Foxa2 and USFs regulate the distal promoter of the rat PC gene in a cell-specific manner.
FABP7 expression has been analysed in a series of 123 glioblastomas (68 pure GBM, 55 GBMO, i.e. with oligodendroglial component). FABP7, found in 91/123 samples, showed a pure cytoplasmic expression in 69 cases, and cytoplasmic+nuclear expression in 22 cases. FABP7 expression was associated with pure GBM histology and shorter survival (15.7 months versus 21.5 months). Nuclear expression of FABP7 was more specifically related to EGFR amplification and more invasive tumors. These data, although they need to be confirmed by further studies, support the relation between FABP7, astrocytic features, invasion and poor prognosis and suggests that EGFR amplification is associated with nuclear translocation of FABP7.
CYP2C9 is the main enzyme participating in warfarin metabolism, of which genetic polymorphism is typical. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of having allelic variants CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 on the pharmacokinetics, dosage regimen, and the rate of hemorrhage in patients with constant atrial fibrillation taking warfarin. Eighty-two patients with constant atrial fibrillation taking warfarin were included in the study. It was shown that in patients with CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 the clearance of warfarin and its dose were lower, while the episodes of excessive hypocoagulation and hemorrhage associated with warfarin were more frequent than in patients without these allelic variants. Basing on the results of the study, the authors propose an algorithm of choosing the initial warfarin dose depending on CYP2C9 genotype.
CYP1A1 and 1A2 play critical roles in the metabolic activation of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic aromatic amines/amides (HAAs), respectively, to electrophilic reactive intermediates, leading to toxicity and cancer. CYP1As are highly inducible by PAHs and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons via aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated gene transcription. The impact of CYP1A induction on the carcinogenic and toxic potentials of environmental, occupational, dietary, and therapeutic chemicals has been a central focus of human risk evaluation and has broadly influenced the fields of cancer research, toxicology, pharmacology, and risk assessment over the past half-century. From the early discovery of CYP1A induction and its role in protection against chemical carcinogenesis in intact animals, to the establishment of CYP1A enzymes as the principal cytochromes P450 for bioactivation of PAHs and HAAs in in vitro assays, to the recent realization of an essential protective role of CYP1A in benzo[a]pyrene-induced lethality and carcinogenesis with CYP1A knockout mice, the understanding of the interrelation between CYP1A induction and chemical safety has followed a full circle. This unique path of CYP1A research underscores the importance of whole animal and human studies in chemical safety evaluation.
CFTR was reported to regulate ENaC channel opening, decreasing ENaC activity in airways and increasing it in sweat ducts. We generated MDCK-I cell lines stably expressing tagged alphabetagammaENaC+CFTR or ENaC alone, and developed an assay to quantify cell-surface half-life of ENaC. Surprisingly, we found that co-expressed CFTR stabilizes ENaC at the plasma membrane, suggesting that CFTR regulates ENaC stability, not just opening.
CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 are the inducible forms of cytochrome P450 expressed in extrahepatic tissues, which are responsible for the biotransformation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines and estradiol to the carcinogenic intermediates. The aim of our research was to determine and compare the inhibitory effect of naturally occurring analogues of trans-resveratrol on the catalytic activities of human recombinant CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. Pinostilbene (3,4'-dihydroxy-5-methoxystilbene), desoxyrhapontigenin (3,5-dihydroxy-4'-methoxystilbene), and pterostilbene (3,5-dimethoxy-4'-hydroxystilbene) appeared to be very potent inhibitors of CYP1A1 catalytic activity with Ki values of 0.13, 0.16 and 0.57 microM, respectively. Results from this study indicate that trans-resveratrol analogues in which the hydroxy groups are substituted by methoxy groups exhibit a remarkably stronger inhibitory effect towards CYP1A1 in comparison to the parent compound. On the contrary, the potency of pinostilbene, desoxyrhapontigenin and pterostilbene towards CYP1B1 with Ki values of 0.90, 2.06 and 0.91 microM, respectively, was comparable to that of resveratrol. It appears that between these analogues, inhibition of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 catalytic activities does not vary much regardless of the number and position of methylether substitution. The results suggest that the trans-resveratrol analogues: pinostilbene, desoxyrhapontigenin and pterostilbene, which occur in some food plants, might be considered as promising chemopreventive agents.
CD36 is a multi-ligand scavenger receptor present on the surface of a number of cells such as platelets, monocytes/macrophages, endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Monocyte/macrophage CD36 has been shown to play a critical role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions by its capacity to bind and endocytose oxidized low density lipoproteins (OxLDL), and it is implicated in the formation of foam cells. However, the significance of CD36 in atherosclerosis has recently been called into question by different studies, and therefore its exact role still needs to be clarified. The aim of this article is to carefully review the importance of CD36 as an essential component in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
ACE on a microchip (MC-ACE) is introduced as a fast and reliable method to determine binding affinities. It is based on monitoring the change in the ionic mobility of a receptor upon binding to a ligand, or vice versa. The method is complementary to other standard methods for binding affinity determinations, like isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, etc. and allows for affinity studies of weak to strong binding interactions. The method is attractive since it principally allows for the analysis of the binding affinity of multiple receptors to a given ligand and requires comparatively small quantities of the binding partners (particularly in comparison to affinity measurements on capillary). We demonstrate the applicability of MC-ACE for the determination of the binding affinities between acid-rich diketopiperazine receptors and basic tripeptides in aqueous solution.
ABO incompatibility is not a barrier for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation but is associated with specific complications. Major ABO incompatibility is associated with delayed erythroid engraftment, increased transfusion requirement and cases of pure red cell aplasia. Minor ABO incompatibility may be responsible for acute haemolytic reactions in the first months following transplantation. The widely used non myeloablative conditioning regimens might modify the management of ABO incompatibility. They could favour pure red cell aplasia development in the setting of major ABO mismatch since they are associated with a prolonged persistence of host anti-donor isohemagglutinins after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the setting of minor ABO incompatibility, the use of peripheral blood stem cells and the nature of graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis regimen may have an impact on the incidence of haemolytic reactions. In that review, the clinical and therapeutic aspects of ABO incompatibility are studied, especially regarding the impact of the conditioning regimen intensity.
CD36 is a broadly expressed membrane glycoprotein that acts as a facilitator of fatty acid uptake, a signaling molecule, and a receptor for a wide range of ligands, including apoptotic cells, modified forms of low density lipoprotein, thrombospondins, fibrillar beta-amyloid, components of Gram positive bacterial walls and malaria infected erythrocytes. CD36 expression on macrophages, dendritic and endothelial cells, and in tissues including muscle, heart, and fat, suggest diverse roles, and indeed, this is truly a multi-functional receptor involved in both homeostatic and pathological conditions. Despite an impressive increase in our knowledge of CD36 functions, in depth understanding of the mechanistic aspects of this protein remains elusive. This review focuses on CD36 in cardiovascular disease-what we know, and what we have yet to learn.
ACE2 appears to counterbalance the vasopressor effect of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) in the reninangiotensin system. We hypothesized that ACE2 polymorphisms could confer a high risk of hypertension and have an impact on the antihypertensive response to ACE inhibitors. The hypothesis was tested in two casecontrol studies and a clinical trial of 3,408 untreated hypertensive patients randomized to Atenolol, Hydrochlorothiazide, Captopril, or Nifedipine treatments for 4 weeks. ACE2 rs2106809 T allele was found to confer a 1.6-fold risk for hypertension in women (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.132.06), whereas when combined with the effect of the ACE DD genotype, the risk was 2.34-fold (95% CI, 1.754.85) in two independent samples. The adjusted diastolic blood pressure response to Captopril was 3.3 mm Hg lower in ACE2 T allele carriers than in CC genotype carriers (P=0.019) in women. We conclude that the ACE2 T allele confers a high risk for hypertension and reduced antihypertensive response to ACE inhibitors.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10), also referred to as MMAC1 (mutated in multiple advanced cancers) gene was recently identified as a putative tumor suppressor in a variety of malignant tumors. PTEN expression has been investigated in some squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of head and neck. However, there is only little knowledge about laryngeal malignancies. Therefore, we examined PTEN product protein immunohistochemically in 30 consecutive laryngeal specimens from patients with laryngeal SCC and compared the results according to the clinicopathologic characteristics of the patients.
DGAT2 is a promising candidate gene for obesity because of its function as a key enzyme in fat metabolism and because of its localization on chromosome 11q13, a linkage region for extreme early onset obesity detected in our sample. We performed a mutation screen in 93 extremely obese children and adolescents and 94 healthy underweight controls. Association studies were performed in samples of up to 361 extremely obese children and adolescents and 445 healthy underweight and normal weight controls. Additionally, we tested for linkage and performed family based association studies at four common variants in the 165 families of our initial genome scan.
DBH is a candidate gene in Parkinson's disease (PD) and contains a putative functional polymorphism (-1021C-->T) that has been reported to modify PD susceptibility. We examined -1021C-->T in a sample of 1,244 PD patients and 1,186 unrelated control subjects. There was no significant difference in allele (p = 0.14) or genotype (p = 0.26) frequencies between the two groups. A similar result was obtained after pooling our data with those previously published. Furthermore, we found no evidence for an effect of genotype on age at onset among patients. Our findings argue against DBH -1021C-->T as a risk factor or age at onset modifier in PD.
ABCB1 encodes the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which regulates the intracellular concentration of many xenobiotics, including several HIV protease inhibitors (PIs). Exposure to some xenobiotics, such as the antibiotic rifampicin, increases P-gp expression. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the HIV PIs saquinavir and atazanavir on the expression and function of ABCB1 and P-gp in primary and cultured lymphocytes, as well as the molecular interactions between these drugs and P-gp. ABCB1 and P-gp expression and function were examined in lymphocyte samples from healthy subjects before and after atazanavir-boosted saquinavir treatment. Expression and function were also studied in CEM cells following exposure to atazanavir and saquinavir. The inhibitory effects of these drugs were investigated in ABCB1-transfected HEK293T cells.
CYP2C9 polymorphisms are associated with decreased S-warfarin clearance and lower maintenance dosage. Decreased expression of VKORC1 resulting from the -1639G>A substitution has also been implicated in lower warfarin dose requirements. We investigated the additional contribution of this polymorphism to the variance in warfarin dose.
MTHFR C677T polymorphism and hyperhomocysteinemia have been associated with congenital malformations of the heart and neural tube defects. A common missense mutation in the MTHFR gene (C to T substitution at position 677) produces a variant with reduced enzymatic action. The aim of this retrospective case control study was to investigate whether the occurrence of the MTHFR polymorphism is increased in mothers and fathers of children with a congenital heart disease (CHD) in our population.
DHCR24 gene in chromosome 1 encodes seladin 1, a cholesterol synthesizing enzyme. Seladin 1 protects neurons from Abeta(42) mediated toxicity and participates in regulation of Abeta(42) formation by organizing the placement of APP cleaving beta-secretase in cholesterol-rich detergent-resistant membrane domains (DRMs). In Alzheimer's disease (AD) the level of seladin 1 in affected neurons is reduced, DRMs are disorganized and Abeta(42) formation is increased. To examine genetic association of the DHCR24 with AD, we genotyped four single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites (rs638944, rs600491, rs718265, and rs7374) in 414 Finnish AD cases and 459 controls and calculated the allelic and genotypic distribution of both cases and controls. The single locus association analysis indicated that men carrying the T allele of rs600491 had an increased risk of AD (OR 1.7 95% CI 1.2-2.4; P = 0.004, Bonferroni corrected P = 0.048 with 12 tests). We estimated haplotypes of SNPs rs638944 and rs600491 between cases and controls and found overall distribution of haplotypes highly significant (P < 0.001). There was a common protective haplotype TC with frequency of 0.22 in cases and 0.30 in controls (P < 0.001) and a risk haplotype GC with frequency of 0.10 in cases and 0.05 in controls (P < 0.001). We also measured CSF Abeta(42), tau and phosphorylated tau (ptau) levels in a subgroup of AD cases (n = 44) and controls (n = 10) and found that AD cases that carry rs718265 GG had lower levels of Abeta(42) than other genotype carriers. Our findings indicate that DHCR24 gene may be associated with AD risk.
ABCA1 plays key roles in cholesterol transport and apolipoprotein E (APOE) metabolism in the brain. To evaluate the relationship between ABCA1 genetic variants and Alzheimer's disease (AD), independently or in concert with the APOE epsilon4 allele, we examined three ABCA1 polymorphisms located in the coding region (R219K, I883M, and R1587K) and two ABCA1 polymorphisms in the promoter region (C-14T and C-477T) in a group of 372 Spanish AD patients and 440 controls. The ABCA1 219K, 883I, 1587R haplotype was significantly associated with AD, conferring a risk of 1.78 (P = 0.007). The ABCA1 C-14T polymorphism modified the risk of AD in an APOE epsilon4 allele-dependent fashion: in APOE epsilon4 carriers, homozygous for the ABCA1 -14T allele had 3.7 times higher risk of developing AD (OR = 13.99) than carriers of the ABCA1 -14CC and CT genotypes (OR = 3.79). These data suggest that the development of AD might be influenced by either a qualitative change of the ABCA1 protein caused by coding region variants (219K, 883I, and 1587R), or by a quantitative change in ABCA1 expression caused by promoter region variant (-14T) in concert with the APOE epsilon4 allele.
"FABP4 delivers specific ligands from the cytosol to the nuclear receptor PPARgamma in the nucleus, thereby facilitating the ligation and enhancing the transcriptional activity of the receptor. Here, we delineate the structural features that underlie the nucleocytoplasmic transport of FABP4. The primary sequence of FABP4 does not harbor a readily identifiable nuclear localization signal (NLS). However, such a signal could be found in the three-dimensional structure of the protein and was mapped to three basic residues that form a functional NLS stabilized by the FABP4/PPARgamma ligand troglitazone. We show that FABP4 is also subject to active nuclear export. Similarly to the NLS, the nuclear export signal (NES) is not apparent in the primary sequence, but assembles in the tertiary structure from three nonadjacent leucine residues to form a motif reminiscent of established NES. The data demonstrate that both nuclear export and nuclear import are critical for enabling FABP4 to enhance the transcriptional activity of PPARgamma. Additionally, the observations provide insight into the fundamental question of how proteins are activated by ligands. Such an activation may be understood by the ""induced-fit"" model, which states that ligand-induced conformational changes precede activation of a protein. Alternatively, the ""pre-existing equilibrium"" hypothesis postulates that activated conformations exist within the repertoire of apoproteins, and that ligands do not induce these but merely stabilize them. Studies of the subcellular localization of FABP4 support the validity of the ""pre-existing equilibrium"" model for the ligand-controlled activation of the nuclear import of FABP4."
TPO (thrombopoietin) and SCF (stem-cell factor) are functionally related cytokines with overlapping but distinct haematopoietic effects. In the present study, a novel TPO-SCF fusion protein that combined the complementary biological effects of TPO and SCF into a single molecule was expressed in, and purified from, Sf9 [Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm)] insect cells. The specific activity of rhTPO (recombinant human TPO)-SCF in megakaryoblastic Mo7e cell proliferation assays was 2.90+/-0.35 x 10(7) units/micromol, approx. 1.7 times as high as that of rhTPO. The specific activity of rhTPO-SCF in TF-1 cells proliferation assays was 7.10+/-0.95 x 10(6) units/micromol, approx. 1.2 times as high as that of rhSCF (recombinant human SCF). In a megakaryocyte-colony-forming assay using human peripheral-blood CD34(+) cells, the SCF moiety of rhTPO-SCF worked in a synergistic way to augment the colony number and exhibited a higher potential to stimulate megakaryocyte colony growth. According to the results of EMSA (electrophoretic mobility-shift assay) and semi-quantitative RT (reverse transcriptase)-PCR, the synergistic effects of the SCF moiety were also reflected in increased STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5) DNA binding and enhanced up-regulation of p21 expression in Mo7e cells treated by rhTPO-SCF, suggesting that rhTPO-SCF could be more potent in promoting megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation.
GPI mannosyltransferase I (GPI-MT-I) transfers the first mannose to a GPI-anchor precursor, glucosamine-(acyl)phosphatidylinositol [GlcN-(acyl)PI]. Mammalian GPI-MT-I consists of two components, PIG-M and PIG-X, which are homologous to Gpi14p and Pbn1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. In the present study, we disrupted yeast GPI14 and analysed the phenotype of gpi14 yeast. The gpi14 haploid cells were inviable and accumulated GlcN-(acyl)PI. We cloned PIG-M homologues from human, Plasmodium falciparum (PfPIG-M) and Trypanosoma brucei (TbGPI14), and tested whether they could complement gpi14-disrupted yeast. None of them restored GPI-MT-I activity and cell growth in gpi14-disrupted yeast. However, gpi14-disrupted yeast cells with human PIG-M, but not with PfPIG-M or TbGPI14, grew slowly but significantly when they were supplemented with rat PIG-X. This suggests that the association of PIG-X and PIG-M for GPI-MT-I activity is not interchangeable between mammals and the other lower eukaryotes.
ABO incompatible (ABO-In) liver transplant remains a controversial solution to acute liver failure in adults. Adult liver recipients with acute liver failure or severely decompensated end-stage disease, intubated and/or in the intensive care unit, were grouped as ABO-In (n = 14), ABO-compatible (n = 29, ABO-C) and ABO-identical (n = 65, ABO-Id). ABO-In received quadruple immunosuppression with antibody-depleting induction agents (except two), calcineurin inhibitors, antimetabolites and steroids. No significant difference of patient and graft survivals was observed among ABO-In, ABO-C and ABO-Id: graft survivals were 64%, 62% and 67%, respectively, in 1 year and 56%, 54% and 60%, respectively, in 5 years; patient survivals 86%, 69% and 67%, respectively, in 1 year and 77%, 61% and 62%, respectively, in 5 years. Three ABO-In grafts were lost (one hyper-acute rejection and two hepatic artery thrombosis). Surgical and infectious complications were similarly distributed between groups, except the hepatic artery thrombosis, more frequent in ABO-In (2, 14%) than ABO-I (1, 1.5%, P < 0.05). In contrast to previous studies, no significant difference of patient and graft survivals could be observed among all ABO-compatibility settings. Our results suggest that ABO-incompatible transplants should be viewed as an important therapeutic option in adult patients with acute liver failure awaiting an emergency procedure.
UGT1A7 and UGT1A9 are uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms involved in the glucuronidation of mycophenolic acid (MPA). The aim of this study was to elucidate MPA pharmacokinetics in UGT1A7 and UGT1A9 intronic I399 genotypes in Japanese adult renal transplant recipients. Eighty recipients were given repeated doses of combination immunosuppressive therapy consisting of mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus every 12 hours at a designated time (9:00 am and 9:00 pm). On day 28 after renal transplantation, plasma MPA concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. All patients had UGT1A9 98TT/-275TT/-2152CC and UGT1A10 177GG/605CC genotypes. The UGT1A7*1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3, *2/*3, and *3/*3 genotypes were detected in 35 (43.8%), five (6.2%), 28 (35.0%), eight (10.0%), and four (5.0%) patients, respectively, and the UGT1A9 I399C/C, C/T, and T/T genotypes were detected in 12 (15.0%), 33 (41.2%), and 35 (43.8%) patients of the 80 Japanese recipients. There were no significant differences in MPA pharmacokinetics among UGT1A7 or UGT1A9 intronic I399 genotype groups. The mean dose-adjusted area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to 12 hours (AUC0-12) of MPA in UGT1A7*1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3, *2/*3, and *3/*3 were 95, 98, 99, 88, and 86 ng.h/mL/mg, respectively (P = 0.9475). The mean dose-adjusted AUC0-12 of MPA in UGT1A9 I399C/C, C/T, and T/T were 87, 99, and 95 ng.h/mL/mg, respectively (P = 0.6937). The dose-adjusted trough levels of MPA in UGT1A9 I399C/C, C/T, and T/T were 5.4, 5.5, and 4.7 ng/mL/mg (P = 0.5845). Although UGT1A7*3 and UGT1A9 I399C/C are known to have low-activity variants when studied in vitro, they do not have reduced in vivo MPA glucuronidation activity. UGT1A7 and UGT1A9 I399 polymorphisms do not contribute to interindividual differences in MPA pharmacokinetics.
CD38 is a multifunctional ectoenzyme that behaves either as an enzyme, a cell adhesion molecule or as a cell surface receptor involved in cell signalling. It is expressed in cells of several lineages, including B and T lymphocytes, and macrophages. CD38 was shown to be important for the development of T-cell dependent humoral immune responses against extracellular pathogens. It also appears to be functionally important in macrophages, which are the host cells of Mycobacterium avium, an intracellular parasite that survives within these cells by avoiding a number of their microbicidal strategies. The present work aimed at investigating whether CD38 had any role on the immune response against mycobacterial infection. After intraperitoneal M. avium infection, the immune response of CD38KO mice was compared to that of their parental strain, C57Bl.6 mice. Absence of CD38 rendered mice more susceptible to mycobacterial infection. This susceptibility seems to be due to ineffective Th1 differentiation and polarization, which is essential for the control of M. avium infection. In addition, absence of CD38 seems to compromise the maintenance of the granulomatous barrier, leading to dissemination and unrestrained growth of mycobacteria.
SULT1A3 is an enzyme that catalyzes the sulfonation of many endogenous and exogenous phenols and catechols. The most important endogenous substrate is dopamine (DA), which is often used as a probe substrate for SULT1A3. We developed a new method for analyzing the SULT1A3 reaction products by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. The sulfonate donor 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), DA and the two dopamine sulfates, DA-3-O-sulfate and DA-4-O-sulfate, can be separated within 3 min. This enables quantitation of the sulfates without radioactive PAPS or the precipitation of unreacted PAPS. Both sulfates were synthesized as reference substances and characterized by (1)H and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The purity of the dopamine sulfates was estimated by HPLC using a diode array detector. We determined the enzyme kinetic parameters for formation of DA-3-O-sulfate and DA-4-O-sulfate using purified recombinant human SULT1A3. The reactions followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics up to 50 microM DA concentration, and strong substrate inhibition was observed at higher concentrations. The apparent K(m) values for sulfonation at both hydroxy groups were similar (2.21+/-0.764 and 2.59+/-1.06 microM for DA-4-O-sulfate and DA-3-O-sulfate, respectively), but the V(max) was approximately six times higher for the formation of the 3-O-sulfate (344+/-139 nmol/min/mg protein) than the 4-O-sulfate (45.4+/-16.5 nmol/min/mg protein). These results are in accordance with the observation that DA-3-O-sulfate is more abundant in human blood than DA-4-O-sulfate and that in the crystal structure of SULT1A3 with dopamine bound to the active site, the 3-hydroxy group is aligned to form hydrogen bonds with catalytic residues of the enzyme.
CYP2A6 is a major phase I enzyme metabolizing tobacco-specific nitrosamines, implicated as risk factors for lung cancer. In this study, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (ISH) for CYP2A6 with human lung cancer tissues (n=31) obtained by surgical resection showed significantly higher immunoreactivity in the cases with lymph node metastasis. The adenocarcinoma cases (n=23) with lymph node metastasis or large tumor size showed a high immunoreactivity for CYP2A6. The squamous cell carcinoma cases (n=6) with large tumor size showed a tendency for low CYP2A6 immunoreactivity. ISH for CYP2A6 revealed mRNA expression in both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma cells. The data suggest that CYP2A6 could have an important role in the development and proliferation of lung carcinomas. With adenocarcinomas, CYP2A6 could be a target candidate for therapeutic and chemopreventive intervention.
UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 are enzymes that commonly contribute to drug glucuronidation. Since genetic factors have been suggested to contribute to variability in activities and expression levels of these enzymes, a quantitative assessment of the influence of the major genotypes (UGT1A1*28 or UGT2B7*2) on enzyme activities was conducted.
CYP2C8 is known to metabolize various drugs including an anticancer drug paclitaxel. Although large interindividual differences in CYP2C8 enzymatic activity and several nonsynonymous variations were reported, neither haplotype structures nor their associations with pharmacokinetic parameters of paclitaxel were reported.
UGT1A3 is one of the most efficient at conjugating estrone, a precursor for biosynthesis of estradiol in peripheral tissues. We established the genetic mechanisms that might contribute to individual variation in UGT1A3 expression and activity. UGT1A3 first exon and 5'-flanking regions were sequenced in 249 Caucasians. We identified 17 polymorphisms, among them seven regulatory and 10 exonic polymorphisms with six leading to amino-acid changes. Luciferase reporter assays, site-directed mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays using hepatoma HepG2 cells were carried out to show functionality of variant promoters. Reduced transcriptional activity was associated with all six variant promoters (two-fold; P<0.001). One of the potential mechanisms would involve the -148 T>C and -581 C>T variations that modulate gene function by affecting hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha binding, respectively. Then, estrone-conjugating activity was assessed with 11 heterologously expressed allozymes. Three phenotypes were observed; UGT1A3*1, *2 (WR, VA) and *3 (WR) with high intrinsic clearance values; UGT1A3*5 (QR, WR), *7 (FI), *9 (WR, ML), *10 (VA) and *11 (WR, VA and MI) had intermediate CLint (2X-10X lower vs. *1), whereas UGT1A3*4 (RW), *6 (WR, VA, MV) and *8 (AV) had low CLint (>10X lower vs. *1). Diplotype analyses indicate that 20.1% of individuals carry two alleles affecting UGT1A3 expression and/or activity. This study did not investigate genotype-phenotype association, but raise the possibility that genetically determined variation might contribute to variability in the inactivation of estrone by UGT1A3 and subsequent changes in lifetime exposure to estrogens potentially modifying risk of cancer.
PDE1B is a calcium-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase that is highly expressed in the striatum. In order to investigate the physiological role of PDE1B in the central nervous system, PDE1B knockout mice (C57BL/6N background) were assessed in behavioral tests and their brains were assayed for monoamine content. In a variety of well-characterized behavioral tasks, including the elevated plus maze (anxiety-like behavior), forced swim test (depression-like behavior), hot plate (nociception) and two cognition models (passive avoidance and acquisition of conditioned avoidance responding), PDE1B knockout mice performed similarly to wild-type mice. PDE1B knockout mice showed increased baseline exploratory activity when compared to wild-type mice. When challenged with amphetamine (AMPH) and methamphetamine (METH), male and female PDE1B knockout mice showed an exaggerated locomotor response. Male PDE1B knockout mice also showed increased locomotor responses to higher doses of phencyclidine (PCP) and MK-801; however, this effect was not consistently observed in female knockout mice. In the striatum, increased dopamine turnover (DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA ratios) was found in both male and female PDE1B knockout mice. Striatal serotonin (5-HT) levels were also decreased in PDE1B knockout mice, although levels of the metabolite, 5HIAA, were unchanged. The present studies demonstrate increased striatal dopamine turnover in PDE1B knockout mice associated with increased baseline motor activity and an exaggerated locomotor response to dopaminergic stimulants such as methamphetamine and amphetamine. These data further support a role for PDE1B in striatal function.
ALDH3A1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1) is abundant in the mouse cornea but undetectable in the lens, and ALDH1A1 is present at lower (catalytic) levels in the cornea and lens. To test the hypothesis that ALDH3A1 and ALDH1A1 protect the anterior segment of the eye against environmentally induced oxidative damage, Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) double knock-out and Aldh1a1(-/-) and Aldh3a1(-/-) single knock-out mice were evaluated for biochemical changes and cataract formation (lens opacification). The Aldh1a1/Aldh3a1- and Aldh3a1-null mice develop cataracts in the anterior and posterior subcapsular regions as well as punctate opacities in the cortex by 1 month of age. The Aldh1a1-null mice also develop cataracts later in life (6-9 months of age). One- to three-month-old Aldh-null mice exposed to UVB exhibited accelerated anterior lens subcapsular opacification, which was more pronounced in Aldh3a1(-/-) and Aldh3a1(-/-)/Aldh1a1(-/-) mice compared with Aldh1a1(-/-) and wild type animals. Cataract formation was associated with decreased proteasomal activity, increased protein oxidation, increased GSH levels, and increased levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal- and malondialdehyde-protein adducts. In conclusion, these findings support the hypothesis that corneal ALDH3A1 and lens ALDH1A1 protect the eye against cataract formation via nonenzymatic (light filtering) and enzymatic (detoxification) functions.
CYP2D6 metabolic capacity shows genetic polymorphism. Two metabolic phenotypes, poor and extensive, can be determined by the ratio of debrisoquine to its metabolite in urine (MR). A subgroup of ultrarapids has been also described. We analyzed the inter-ethnic differences on the polymorphic hydroxylation of debrisoquine in a Cuban population in comparison to Spaniards.
CYP1A2 expression is constitutively high in mouse liver and is well known for metabolizing several drugs and many procarcinogens to reactive intermediates that can cause toxicity or cancer. In the present study, the basal level of hepatic CYP1A2 activity was shown to vary among different inbred mouse strains. The highest methoxyresorufin-O-demethylase activity (261+/-52pmol/mgprotein/min) was registered in CC57BR and the lowest (82+/-11pmol/mgprotein/min) in C3H/a. We have tested the hypothesis that possible polymorphisms in regulatory elements in the 5'-upstream region of the mouse CYP1A2 gene could cause the differences in CYP1A2 enzyme activity among different inbred strains. We have performed a study on the CYP1A2 gene by sequencing the regulatory region from -4675 to -4204 where two enhancer elements were recently identified. The absence of mutation prescribing the phenotype in the CYP1A2 gene was found. The region studied seems to be a highly conserved in mice and not to be associated with interstrain differences in constitutive CYP1A2 enzyme activity.
ABCA3 is proposed to function as a lung surfactant lipid transporter. Here we report ABCA3-dependent lipid uptake into intracellular vesicles in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. A549 cells stably expressing GFP-tagged wild-type ABCA3 (A549/ABCA3(WT)) had larger LAMP3-positive vesicles than their parental cells as well as A549 cells expressing a Walker A motif mutant (A549/ABCA3(N568D)). The choline-phospholipids level in A549/ABCA3(WT) was increased 1.25-fold compared to that in A549 and A549/ABCA3(N568D) cells, while the cholesterol levels were similar. Sucrose gradient fractionation analysis in A549/ABCA3(WT) cells revealed that choline-phospholipids were enriched in low-density and nile red-positive vesicles. Electronmicroscopic analysis showed multilamellar vesicles in A549/ABCA3(WT) cells. These results indicate that ABCA3 mediates ATP-dependent choline-phospholipids uptake into intracellular vesicles.
ABCG2 is a transporter with potential importance in cancer drug resistance, drug oral absorption, and stem cell biology. In an effort to identify novel inhibitors of ABCG2, we examined the ability of commercially available bisindolylmaleimides (BIM) and indolocarbazole protein kinase inhibitors (PKI) to inhibit ABCG2, given the previous demonstration that the indolocarbazole PKI UCN-01 interacted with the transporter. At a concentration of 10 micromol/L, all of the compounds tested increased intracellular fluorescence of the ABCG2-specific substrate pheophorbide a in ABCG2-transfected HEK-293 cells by 1.3- to 6-fold as measured by flow cytometry; the ABCG2-specific inhibitor fumitremorgin C increased intracellular fluorescence by 6.6-fold. In 4-day cytotoxicity assays, wild-type ABCG2-transfected cells were not more than 2-fold resistant to any of the compounds, suggesting that the PKIs are not significantly transported by ABCG2. BIMs I, II, III, IV, and V, K252c, and arcyriaflavin A were also able to inhibit [(125)I]iodoarylazidoprazosin labeling of ABCG2 by 65% to 80% at 20 micromol/L, compared with a 50% to 70% reduction by 20 micromol/L fumitremorgin C. K252c and arcyriaflavin A were the most potent compounds, with IC(50) values for inhibition of [(125)I]iodoarylazidoprazosin labeling of 0.37 and 0.23 micromol/L, respectively. K252c and arcyriaflavin A did not have any effect on the ATPase activity of ABCG2. Four minimally toxic compounds--BIM IV, BIM V, arcyriaflavin A, and K252c-reduced the relative resistance of ABCG2-transfected cells to SN-38 in cytotoxicity assays. We find that indolocarbazole and BIM PKIs directly interact with the ABCG2 protein and may thus increase oral bioavailability of ABCG2 substrates.
SDHD germ-line mutations predispose to pheochromocytoma (PCC) and paraganglioma (PGL).
CFTR is a multifunctional protein of the ATP binding cassette family that may contribute to overall electrolyte homeostasis by acting as a chloride channel in the kidney. In renal tissues CFTR does not exists only in its full-length form, but also as a kidney-specific, truncated splice variant, TNR-CFTR. In this study we show that both forms of CFTR are regulated by thyroid hormones in rat renal tissue. Four groups of male rats were used: control, hypothyroid, hypothyroid with T(4) treatment and hyperthyroid rats. The hypothyroid rats showed a decrease of both CFTR and TNR-CFTR mRNAs (44%, and 49%, respectively, n=5; p<0.05) and proteins (30% and 37%, respectively, n=5, p<0.05) expressions, compared to control group. In hyperthyroid rats, a significant increase in both CFTR and TRN-CFTR mRNAs expressions (43% and 95%, n=5; p<0.05) and proteins (250% and 38%, respectively, n=5, p<0.05) was observed when compared to control group. Treatment of immortalized rat proximal tubule cells (IRPTC) with T(3) (10(-7)M) produced also an increase of CFTR mRNA expression (95%, n=5, p<0.05). Analysis of the promoter region of CFTR transfected to IRPTC showed that T(3) (10(-7) M) stimulates the CFTR promoter (38%, n=4, p<0.05).
CYP2C9 is known as an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of various clinically important drugs. Recently, we cloned a cDNA corresponding to a CYP2C9 splicing variant (SV), which seemed to have an open reading frame of a protein with 482 amino acid residues. To investigate whether or not the SV can be translated as a functionally active protein, we expressed the CYP2C9SV in insect cells, and spectrophotometric and enzymatic properties were characterized. The CYP2C9SV protein showed a typical reduced CO-difference spectrum, indicating that the translated protein binds a heme moiety. However, CYP2C9SV did not metabolize tolbutamide or diclofenac at all, suggesting that the SV protein appeared to lack the ability to catalyze reactions mediated by CYP2C9. Although the CYP2C9SV mRNA was detected in all human liver samples examined in this study by real-time PCR, the level was generally low, ranging between 0.7 and 9.6% of the normal CYP2C9 mRNA. These results suggest that the CYP2C9SV protein is unlikely to contribute to CYP2C9 activities, although it appears to be expressed in most individuals.
CYP1A2 is an important inducible enzyme involved in the metabolism of antipsychotics. This study examined two functional polymorphisms in the gene as potential markers in predicting prolongation of QTc interval in patients treated with antipsychotics. QT intervals were measured by 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) for patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia. Genomic DNA extracted from venous blood were genotyped for the two polymorphisms by PCR-RFLP. Statistically significant result for CYP1A2(*)1F was noted for all patients receiving chlorpromazine equivalent doses of above 300 mg and also for a further subgroup on antipsychotics known to be CYP1A2 substrates (p=0.007, mean QTc in ms for A/A: 395.5+/-15.1, A/C: 425.7+/-25.1, C/C: 427.3+/-20.7). For CYP1A2(*)1C, there was no statistically significant association between genotypes and mean QTc interval. Overall, there was a trend of those with the C allele of the CYP1A2(*)1F polymorphism having longer QTc intervals. The results of this study suggest that the CYP1A2(*)1F polymorphism may contribute to the risk of developing prolonged QT-interval in patients who are treated with higher doses of antipsychotics.
PTEN mutations are among the most frequent genetic alterations found in human prostate cancers. Our previous works suggest that although precancerous lesions were found in Pten heterozygous mice, cancer progression and metastasis only happened when both alleles of Pten were deleted. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of PTEN in prostate cancer control, we generated two pairs of isogenic, androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate epithelial lines from intact conditional Pten knock-out mice that are either heterozygous (PTEN-P2 and -P8) or homozygous (PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8) for Pten deletion. Further characterization of these cells showed that loss of the second allele of Pten leads to increased anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo without obvious structural or numerical chromosome changes based on SKY karyotyping analysis. Despite no prior exposure to hormone ablation therapy, Pten null cells are tumorigenic in both male and female severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Furthermore, knocking down PTEN can convert the androgen-dependent Myc-CaP cell into androgen independence, suggesting that PTEN intrinsically controls androgen responsiveness, a critical step in the development of hormone refractory prostate cancer. Importantly, knocking down AR by shRNA in Pten null cells reverses androgen-independent growth in vitro and partially inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo, indicating that PTEN-controlled prostate tumorigenesis is AR dependent. These cell lines will serve as useful tools for understanding signaling pathways controlled by PTEN and elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in hormone refractory prostate cancer formation.
ABCG2 belongs to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transmembrane proteins and is ubiquitously expressed in stem cells including those in the developing nervous system. The ability of ABCG2 to preferentially exclude DNA-intercalating dyes is regarded to be the basis for the enrichment of stem cells or progenitors as dye(low) side population (SP) cells. However, the role of ABCG2 in neural stem cells remains speculative and poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate using retinal stem cells, that ABCG2 is the molecular determinant of SP cell phenotype of neural stem cells and plays an important role in their maintenance. Overexpression of ABCG2 prevents the SP cell phenotype and adversely affects the lineage commitment of retinal stem cells. By contrast, targeted attenuation of ABCG2 depletes retinal SP cells and promotes their differentiation along pan neural and retinal lineages. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that ABCG2 is a target of Notch signaling, and as such, constitutes one of the genes in the regulatory network of Notch signaling, involved in the maintenance of stem cells.
PAH generation behaviors in carbonization were compared, using cypress, chestnut, and bamboo as samples. Generation of tarry matter was almost completed by the time the temperature reached 400 degrees C, while generation of PAHs continued until the temperature reached 1,000 degrees C. The weight of tarry matter per unit sample weight was large with bamboo, while the amount of PAHs was large with cypress. Of the 15 types of PAHs measured this time, the largest amount collected was fluorene, followed by phenanthrene and anthracene. The amount of PAHs generated accounted for 6 x 10(-6) to 16 x 10(-6) of the weight of the wood samples.
CD36 is a multiligand receptor involved in various metabolic pathways, including cellular uptake of long-chain fatty acids. Defect function or expression of CD36 can result in dyslipidemia or insulin resistance. We have previously shown that CD36 expression is female-predominant in rat liver. In the present study, hormonal and nutritional regulation of hepatic CD36 expression was examined in male and female rats. Since alternative transcription start sites have been described in murine and human Cd36, we investigated whether alternative CD36 transcripts are differentially regulated in rat liver during these conditions.
CYP2J2 is abundant in cardiac tissue and active in the biosynthesis of eicosanoids such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). To determine the effects of CYP2J2 and its eicosanoid products in the heart, we characterized the electrophysiology of single cardiomyocytes isolated from adult transgenic (Tr) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of CYP2J2. CYP2J2 Tr cardiomyocytes had a shortened action potential. At 90% repolarization, the action potential duration (APD) was 30.6 +/- 3.0 ms (n = 22) in wild-type (Wt) cells and 20.2 +/- 2.3 ms (n = 19) in CYP2J2 Tr cells (p < 0.005). This shortening was probably due to enhanced maximal peak transient outward K(+) currents (I(to,peak)), which were 38.6 +/- 2.8 and 54.4 +/- 4.9 pA/pF in Wt and CYP2J2 Tr cells, respectively (p < 0.05). In contrast, the late portion of the transient outward K(+) current (I(to,280ms)), the slowly inactivating outward K(+) current (I(K,slow)), and the voltage-gated Na(+) current (I(Na)) were not significantly altered in CYP2J2 Tr cells. N-Methylsulphonyl-6-(2-proparglyloxy-phenyl)hexanamide (MS-PPOH), a specific inhibitor of EET biosynthesis, significantly reduced I(to,peak) and increased APD in CYP2J2 Tr cardiomyocytes but not in Wt cells. Intracellular dialysis with a monoclonal antibody against CYP2J2 also significantly reduced I(to,peak) and increased APD in CYP2J2 Tr cardiomyocytes. Addition of 11,12-EET or 8-bromo-cAMP significantly reversed the MS-PPOH- or monoclonal antibody-induced changes in I(to,peak) and APD in CYP2J2 Tr cells. Together, our data demonstrate that shortening of the action potential in CYP2J2 Tr cardiomyocytes is associated with enhanced I(to,peak) via an EET-dependent, cAMP-mediated mechanism.
SLC11A1 (also known as Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein1, NRAMP1) plays a crucial role in resistance of inbred mice to infection with several intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium, Leishmania and Salmonella. In this study, PCR amplification and sequencing were performed to obtain the genomic organization and sequence of porcine SLC11A1 gene by comparative genomic analysis. Results showed that porcine SLC11A1 gene consists of 15 exons and 14 introns, which is consistent with that of mice and human. All introns were sequenced and their nucleotide sequences were submitted to GenBank. The exon/intron boundaries were determined by comparing cDNA sequence with amplified genomic DNA sequences. Mutational analysis was performed on exonic and neighboring intronic region by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and sequencing confirmation. Forty polymorphisms were identified; six are located in exons and thirty-four in introns. Two exonic polymorphisms are nonsynonymous changes (D6H and V175I), three are synonymous changes (S23, G33 and I155), and one is in 3' UTR. The availability of the fine genomic organization and identification of the polymorphisms will facilitate the evaluation of porcine SLC11A1 functional role in diseases resistance or susceptibility.
ABCA1 is a key element of cholesterol efflux, but the mechanism of ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux is still unclear. Monoclonal antibodies against ABCA1 were used to map functional domains of ABCA1. Two antibodies were directed against a fragment of the first extracellular loop of ABCA1, and the third antibody was directed against a fragment of the fourth extracellular loop. One antibody against the first loop inhibited cholesterol efflux from human macrophages without inhibiting apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) binding and internalization. Another antibody against the first loop inhibited apoA-I binding and internalization without inhibiting cholesterol efflux. The antibody against the fourth loop inhibited apoA-I binding to ABCA1 but enhanced cholesterol efflux from macrophages and reduced intracellular cholesterol content. This antibody also increased cholesterol efflux from HeLa cells transfected with ABCA1 but not from cells with DeltaPEST-ABCA1. The mechanism of the stimulating effect of this antibody on cholesterol efflux was found to be stabilization of ABCA1 leading to the increase in abundance of cell surface ABCA1. We conclude that a site on the first extracellular loop is required for cholesterol efflux, whereas a site on the fourth extracellular loop may be responsible for ABCA1 stability.
ACE inhibition results in secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) through different mechanisms including improvement of endothelial dysfunction. The Perindopril-Function of the Endothelium in Coronary artery disease Trial (PERFECT) evaluated whether long-term administration of perindopril improves endothelial dysfunction.
CBS is a vitamin B6-dependent transsulfuration enzyme needed to synthesize cysteine from methionine, catalyzing the condensation of serine with homocysteine to form cystathionine. A deficiency of CBS causes homocystinuria (MIM 236200), one of the most prevalent inborn errors, characterized by mental retardation, seizures, psychiatric disturbances, skeletal abnormalities and vascular disorders. Patients with CBS deficiency exhibit a major biochemical abnormality, hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), a condition associated with highly elevated plasma homocysteine levels. HHcy is recognized as a risk factor for several neurological diseases, such as cognitive impairment, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Although the link between CBS deficiency and homocystinuria was first described over 40 years ago and mental retardation was the first clinical feature of the disease to be classified, very little is known about the role of CBS in the CNS. Here we show the regional and cellular distribution of CBS in the adult and developing mouse brain. In the adult mouse brain, CBS was expressed ubiquitously, but most intensely in the cerebellar molecular layer and hippocampal dentate gyrus. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CBS is preferentially expressed in cerebellar Bergmann glia and in astrocytes throughout the brain. At early developmental stages, CBS was expressed in neuroepithelial cells in the ventricular zone, but its expression changed to radial glial cells and then to astrocytes during the late embryonic and neonatal periods. Moreover, CBS was significantly accumulated in reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus after kainic acid-induced seizures, and cerebellar morphological abnormalities were observed in CBS-deficient mice. These results support the role of CBS in the development and maintenance of the CNS, and suggest that radial glia/astrocyte dysfunction might be involved in the complex neuropathological features associated with abnormal homocysteine metabolism.
CYP2A13 is the most efficient cytochrome P450 enzyme in the metabolic activation of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a tobacco-specific lung carcinogen. The aims of this study were to determine the levels of CYP2A13 protein in human lung microsomes and to ascertain whether CYP2A13 plays any role in lung microsomal NNK metabolic activation. The expression of CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 was examined using a high-resolution immunoblotting method, following immunopurification with an anti-CYP2A5 antibody. We found that, of 116 human lung microsomal samples analyzed, approximately 90% had detectable CYP2A6, whereas only 12% had detectable CYP2A13 with a detection limit of approximately 2 fmol of CYP2A/mg protein. For the majority of microsomal samples analyzed, the level of CYP2A13 was found to be lower than the level of CYP2A6; overall, the highest level of CYP2A13 found ( approximately 20 fmol/mg protein) was approximately 10-fold lower than the highest level of CYP2A6 detected. Quantitative RNA-polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed that the highly variable expression of the CYP2A proteins was consistent with variations in the levels of the corresponding CYP2A mRNAs in the same tissue samples. It is noteworthy that the level of CYP2A13, but not CYP2A6, was correlated with lung microsomal NNK metabolic activation activity. Furthermore, the addition of 8-methoxypsoralen, a CYP2A inhibitor, led to greater inhibition of NNK metabolic activation in microsomes containing relatively high levels of CYP2A13 than in samples containing no detectable CYP2A13. Taken together, these data indicate that human lung microsomal CYP2A13 is active in NNK metabolic activation. Therefore, individuals having relatively high levels of CYP2A13 expression will likely have an increased risk of developing smoking-related lung cancer.
SLC26A9 is a member of the SLC26 family of anion transporters, which is expressed at high levels in airway and gastric surface epithelial cells. The transport properties and regulation of SLC26A9, and thus its physiological function, are not known. Here we report that SLC26A9 is a highly selective Cl(-) channel with minimal OH(-)/HCO(3)(-) permeability that is regulated by the WNK kinases. Expression in Xenopus oocytes and simultaneous measurement of membrane potential or current, intracellular pH (pH(i)) and intracellular Cl(-) (Cl(-)(i)) revealed that expression of SLC26A9 resulted in a large Cl(-) current. SLC26A9 displays a selectivity sequence of I(-) > Br(-) > NO(3)(-) > Cl(-) > Glu(-), but it conducts Br(-) > Cl(-) > I(-) > NO(3)(-) > Glu(-), with NO(3)(-) and I(-) inhibiting the Cl(-) conductance. Similarly, expression of SLC26A9 in HEK cells resulted in a large Cl(-) current. Although detectable, OH(-) and HCO(3)(-) fluxes in oocytes expressing SLC26A9 were very small. Moreover, HCO(3)(-) had no discernable effect on the Cl(-) current, the reversal potential in the presence or absence of Cl(-)(o) and, importantly, HCO(3)(-) had no effect on Cl(-) fluxes. These findings indicate that SLC26A9 is a Cl(-) channel with minimal OH(-)/HCO(3)(-) permeability. Co-expression of SLC26A9 with the WNK kinases WNK1, WNK3 or WNK4 inhibited SLC26A9 activity, and the inhibition was independent of WNK kinase activity. Immunolocalization in oocytes and cell surface biotinylation in HEK cells indicated that the WNK-mediated inhibition of SLC26A9 activity is caused by reduced SLC26A9 surface expression. Expression of SLC26A9 in the airway and the response of the WNKs to homeostatic stress raise the possibility that SLC26A9 serves to mediate the response of the airway to stress.
CD36 is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the class B scavenger receptor family. The CD36 gene is located on chromosome 7 q11.2 and is encoded by 15 exons. Defective CD36 is a likely candidate gene for impaired fatty acid metabolism, glucose intolerance, atherosclerosis, arterial hypertension, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, Alzheimer disease, and modification of the clinical course of malaria. Contradictory data concerning the effects of antiatherosclerotic drugs on CD36 expression indicate that further investigation of the role of CD36 in the development of atherosclerosis may be important for the prevention and treatment of this disease. This review summarizes current knowledge of CD36 gene structure, splicing, and mutations and the molecular, metabolic, and clinical consequences of these phenomena.
CYP2A6 metabolizes various nitrosamines, such as those in the diet and in tobacco smoke, which have been implicated as risk factors for colorectal tumors. To determine whether changes in expression levels could contribute to their progression, we carried out immunohistochemistry for CYP2A6 in human colon tumors. Colon specimens (n = 53) were diagnosed as adenoma (n = 16), adenocarcinoma (n = 30) or carcinoma in or with adenoma (n = 7). Colon tumor cells showed cytoplasmic granular immunoreactivity for CYP2A6. Adenocarcinomas and adjacent mucosa showed similar highly elevated degrees of CYP2A6 expression, whereas carcinomas in or with adenoma and adenomas showed lesser increases. To further determine whether CYP2A6 mRNA was expressed at the same level as the CYP2A6 protein, we carried out in situ hybridization of CYP2A6 in two cases of adenocarcinoma. In situ hybridization for CYP2A6 revealed mRNA expression in adenocarcinoma cells. The data indicate that CYP2A6 may have important roles in human colorectal tumorigenesis and progression, so that it could be a candidate therapeutic and chemopreventive target for colorectal cancers.
CYP2C9 catalyzes the demethylation of the biphasic kinetics substrate (S)-naproxen, and the CYP2C9*2 (R144C) and CYP2C9*3 (I359L) variants are associated with lower rates of (S)-naproxen demethylation. To assess the reasons for these reductions in catalytic activity of the two variants and potential substrate concentration-dependent differences in a biphasic kinetics substrate, cytochrome P450 (P450) cycle coupling and uncoupling were monitored during coincubation of (S)-naproxen and CYP2C9 over a range of P450 reductase concentrations. Coupling was greatest in the CYP2C9.1 enzyme, followed by CYP2C9.2, and then CYP2C9.3. Uncoupling in CYP2C9.1 and CYP2C9.3 was primarily to H(2)O(2). In contrast, CYP2C9.2 uncoupled to excess water preferentially. The conversion of enzyme to the high spin state was similar in CYP2C9.1 and CYP2C9.2, but lower in CYP2C9.3. It is noteworthy that neither altered substrate binding nor altered interaction with reductase seemed to be involved in reduced catalysis. These results suggest that in addition to coupling differences, differential uncoupling to shunt products and differences in spin state help explain the reduced catalytic activity in these enzymes.
WWOX (WW domain-containing oxidoreductase) gene, located on chromosome 16q 23.3-24.1 in the region recognized as the common fragile site FRA16D is considered to be a tumor suppressor gene involved in various cancers: breast, ovarian, prostate, esophageal, lung, pancreatic, gastric and hepatic. The aim of this study was to describe (i) putative protein interactions of WWOX (ii) the molecular mechanisms of tumor suppressor activity (iii) present an overview of WWOX in relation to nervous system and breast, prostate and ovarian cancers.
G6PD deficiency is a common hemolytic genetic disorder, particularly in the areas endemic to malaria. Individuals are generally asymptomatic and hemolytic anemia occurs when some anti-malarial drugs or other oxidizing chemicals are administered. It has been proposed that G6PD deficiency provides protection against malaria. Maintaining of G6PD deficient alleles at polymorphic proportions is complicated because of the X-linked nature of G6PD deficiency. A comprehensive review of the literature on the hypothesis of malarial protection and the nature of the selection is being presented. Most of the epidemiological, in vitro and in vivo studies report selection for G6PD deficiency. Analysis of the G6PD gene also reveals that G6PD-deficient alleles show some signatures of selection. However, the question of how this polymorphism is being maintained remains unresolved because the selection/fitness coefficients for the different genotypes in the two sexes have not been established. Prevalence of G6PD deficiency in Indian caste and tribal populations and the different variants reported has also been reviewed.
SLC35A3 encodes a Golgi-resident UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter. Here, the porcine SLC35A3 gene was assigned to Sus scrofa chromosome 4 (SSC4) by a combination of radiation hybrid and linkage analysis. Expression profiling using real time RT-PCR showed ubiquitous but variable transcription of SLC35A3 in a selection of tissues. The deduced 325 amino acid sequence revealed a hydrophobic protein with 10 predicted transmembrane helices and the N- and C-terminal tails facing the cytosolic side of the Golgi apparatus. In addition, mutated versions of the UDP-GlcNAc transporter were analyzed in a yeast complementation assay, which allowed us to identify important domains and amino acid residues. Thus, the N-terminal tail was inessential for activity, whereas removal of the first transmembrane domain inhibited yeast complementation. The hydrophilic C-terminus was dispensable while mutant proteins either fully or partially deprived of the last membrane-spanning helix were functionally impaired. The third luminal loop showed modest sequence conservation and appeared structurally flexible as certain deletions were acceptable. In contrast, the fourth luminal loop was more sensitive to changes since the competence of the mutant protein was lowered by mutations. Substitutions of glycines 190, 215 and 254, which are invariant positions in the SLC35A subfamilies affected activity negatively. Interestingly, inhibition of function by a valine to phenylalanine mutation, which has been associated with skeletal malformations, is likely caused by structural incompatibility of the bulky aromatic phenylalanine side chain with the integrity of the transmembrane helix, since substitutions with the smaller aliphatic side chains of leucine and isoleucine were acceptable changes.
CBS (cystathionine beta-synthase) domains are found in proteins from all kingdoms of life, and point mutations in these domains are responsible for a variety of hereditary diseases in humans; however, the functions of CBS domains are not well understood. In the present study, we cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and characterized a family II PPase (inorganic pyrophosphatase) from Moorella thermoacetica (mtCBS-PPase) that has a pair of tandem 60-amino-acid CBS domains within its N-terminal domain. Because mtCBS-PPase is a dimer and requires transition metal ions (Co2+ or Mn2+) for activity, it resembles common family II PPases, which lack CBS domains. The mtCBS-PPase, however, has lower activity than common family II PPases, is potently inhibited by ADP and AMP, and is activated up to 1.6-fold by ATP. Inhibition by AMP is competitive, whereas inhibition by ADP and activation by ATP are both of mixed types. The nucleotides are effective at nanomolar (ADP) or micromolar concentrations (AMP and ATP) and appear to compete for the same site on the enzyme. The nucleotide-binding affinities are thus 100-10000-fold higher than for other CBS-domain-containing proteins. Interestingly, genes encoding CBS-PPase occur most frequently in bacteria that have a membrane-bound H+-translocating PPase with a comparable PP(i)-hydrolysing activity. Our results suggest that soluble nucleotide-regulated PPases act as amplifiers of metabolism in bacteria by enhancing or suppressing ATP production and biosynthetic reactions at high and low [ATP]/([AMP]+[ADP]) ratios respectively.
CYP3A4 (cytochrome P450 3A4) is involved in the metabolism of more than 50% of drugs and other xenobiotics. The expression of CYP3A4 is induced by many structurally dissimilar compounds. The PXR (pregnane X receptor) is recognized as a key regulator for the induction, and the PXR-directed transactivation of the CYP3A4 gene is achieved through a co-ordinated mechanism of the distal module with the proximal promoter. Recently, a far module was found to support constitutive expression of CYP3A4. The far module, like the distal module, is structurally clustered by a PXR response element (F-ER6) and elements recognized by HNF-4alpha (hepatocyte nuclear receptor-4alpha). We hypothesized that the far module supports PXR transactivation of the CYP3A4 gene. Consistent with the hypothesis, fusion of the far module to the proximal promoter of CYP3A4 markedly increased rifampicin-induced reporter activity. The increase was synergistically enhanced when both the far and distal modules were fused to the proximal promoter. The increase, however, was significantly reduced when the F-ER6 was disrupted. Chromatin immunoprecipitation detected the presence of PXR in the far module. Interestingly, HNF-4alpha increased the activity of the distal-proximal fused promoter, but decreased the activity of the far-proximal fused promoter. Given the fact that induction of CYP3A4 represents an important detoxification mechanism, the functional redundancy and synergistic interaction in supporting PXR transactivation suggest that the far and distal modules ensure the induction of CYP3A4 during chemical insults. The difference in responding to HNF-4alpha suggests that the magnitude of the induction is under control through various transcriptional networks.
ABCG2 is a half ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that facilitates efflux of a wide variety of substrates ranging from natural products to synthetic anticancer drugs. Over-expression of ABCG2 has been shown to cause multidrug resistance in both laboratory model cell lines and in clinical settings. The polymorphism in ABCG2 has also been suggested to affect the function and clinical outcome in cancer patients. More recently, ABCG2 has been suggested to play a protective role for cancer and normal stem cells. Thus, ABCG2 is an ideal target for therapeutic development to chemo-sensitize drug resistant cancers. In this paper, the recent progress on understanding the structure, function, and pharmacology of ABCG2 and its role in drug resistance and cancer stem cells will be reviewed.
CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein found mainly on the plasma membrane involved in the metabolism of cADPR and NAADP, two nucleotides with calcium mobilizing activity independent of inositol trisphosphate. Recent data report the presence of CD38 in different cellular compartments raising new questions about its effective role in cellular metabolism. In rat hepatocyte nuclei, CD38 has been proposed as a responsive to cADPR integral inner membrane protein suggesting that the nuclear envelope may also be an important source of Ca2+ stores. Further reports indicating that CD38 is localized in nuclear compartments in a variety of cell types and tissues including brain, liver, eye, spleen, and bone raise the condition of resolving the question concerning the effective presence of CD38 within the nucleus. Here we report data supporting the presence of CD38 at nuclear level independently of expression of surface CD38. We utilized two different human leukemia cell lines expressing or not expressing CD38 molecule on their cell surface. The morphological and biochemical results including enzymatic activity and proteomic determinations explain the effective nuclear localization of CD38 in human Raji and K562 cells. Since cell nucleus is a complex and highly dynamic environment with many functionally specialized regions, the nuclear localization of specific proteins represents an important mechanism in signal transduction. The presence of CD38 at the interchromatin region whether linked to nuclear scaffold or stored in nuclear structures as micronuclei and Cajal bodies co-localizing with coilin, suggests its involvement in nuclear processes including transcription, replication, repairing and splicing.
WWOX is a putative tumor suppressor gene encoded within common chromosomal fragile site region FRA16D, in chromosome band 16q23. Multiple studies have demonstrated that WWOX expression is often reduced or lost in various tumor types. WWOX tumor suppressor activity was suggested by re-expressing WWOX in breast, ovarian, and lung tumor cell lines leading to tumor growth inhibition in vivo. To determine whether loss of Wwox gene expression has a role in tumorigenesis, we generated a mouse strain containing a Wwox gene mutated by a gene-trap vector. Homozygous Wwox gene-trap mice (Wwox(gt/gt)) had no detectable Wwox protein in most tissues examined, although, a low level could be detected in a minority of tissues. Because of these observations, we concluded that these mice are Wwox hypomorphs. Remarkably, Wwox hypomorphic mice are viable in contrast to the recently reported postnatal lethality of Wwox knockout mice. Testes from Wwox(gt/gt) males had high numbers of atrophic seminiferous tubules and reduced fertility when compared with wild-type counterparts. We observed that the Wwox(gt/gt) mice had a significantly shorter lifespan, and female hypomorphs had a higher incidence of spontaneous B-cell lymphomas. In conclusion, we describe a novel Wwox hypomorphic mouse model that overcomes postnatal lethality that was recently observed in Wwox knockout mice. Therefore, tumorigenesis studies using this model more closely recapitulates the loss of WWOX expression observed in human cancers. Importantly, our observation that Wwox hypomorphs had an increased incidence of B-cell lymphomas supports a role of Wwox as a tumor suppressor.
NPC1L1 (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1), the pharmacological target of the cholesterol-uptake inhibitor ezetimibe, is a transporter localized on the brush border of enterocytes. Although this protein plays a key role in intestinal uptake of sterols, multiple molecular events that underlie intestinal cholesterol absorption have not been fully characterized. Two proteins that might be involved in this process are NPC1 and NPC2 (Niemann-Pick disease type C proteins 1 and 2), which function in the endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol egress pathway and whose deficiency results in NPC (Niemann-Pick type C) disease. The involvement of these proteins in intestinal cholesterol absorption was examined in mutant mice lacking either NPC1 or NPC2. Our data indicate that deficiencies in either protein do not have an effect on cholesterol uptake or absorption. This contrasts with recent results obtained for the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, which indicate that a deficiency of NPC1 (dNPC1a being its Drosophila homologue) leads to activation of an NPC1L1 (Drosophila homologue dNPC1b)-independent cholesterol uptake pathway, underscoring fundamental differences in mammalian and non-mammalian cholesterol metabolism.
UCP3 (uncoupling protein-3) is a mitochondrial membrane transporter expressed preferentially in skeletal muscle. UCP3 lowers mitochondrial membrane potential and protects muscle cells against an overload of fatty acids, and it probably reduces excessive production of reactive oxygen species. Accordingly, ucp3 gene transcription is highly sensitive to fatty acid-dependent stimulation and also to other unrelated stress signals. In this study, glucocorticoids are identified as major inducers of ucp3 gene transcription in muscle. Glucocorticoids activate the transcription of the ucp3 gene through a glucocorticoid receptor-binding site in the promoter region. Glucocorticoids are capable of inducing ucp3 gene transcription independently from the myogenic regulatory factor MyoD, in contrast with the transcriptional activation of the ucp3 gene through other nuclear hormone receptors. An interplay of regulatory factors modulates positively (p300) or negatively (histone deacetylases) the action of glucocorticoids on ucp3 gene transcription via histone acetylation or deacetylation processes, respectively. Among them, SIRT1 acts as a major repressor of ucp3 gene expression in response to glucocorticoids. The action of SIRT1 requires its deacetylase activity and results in histone deacetylation in the ucp3 promoter. Moreover, it involves a specific impairment of association of p300 with the glucocorticoid receptor. Agents activating SIRT1, such as resveratrol, repress ucp3 gene expression. The control of SIRT1 activity via the metabolic redox status of the cell points to a novel regulatory pathway of ucp3 gene transcription in response to metabolic and stress signaling in muscle cells.
ACE is a popular technique for evaluating association constants between drugs and proteins. However, ACE has not previously been applied to study the association between electrically neutral biomolecules and plasma proteins. We studied the affinity between human and bovine serum albumins (HSA and BSA, respectively) and three neutral endogenous steroid hormones (testosterone, epitestosterone and androstenedione) and two synthetic analogues (methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone) by applying the partial-filling technique in ACE (PF-ACE). From the endocrinological point of view, the distribution of endogenous steroids among plasma components is of great interest. Strong interactions with albumins suppress the biological activity of steroids. Notable differences in the association constants were observed. In the case of the endogenous steroids, the interactions between testosterone and the albumins were strongest, and those between androstenedione and the albumins were substantially weaker. The association constants, K(b), for testosterone, epitestosterone and androstenedione and HSA at 37 degrees C were 32 100 +/- 3600, 21 600 +/- 1500 and 13 300 +/- 1300 M(-1), respectively, while the corresponding values for the steroids and BSA were 18 800 +/- 1500, 14 000 +/- 400 and 7800 +/- 900 M(-1). Methyltestosterone was bound even more strongly than testosterone, while fluoxymesterone was only weakly bound by the albumins. Finally, the steroids were separated by PF-ACE with HSA and BSA used as resolving components.
"CYP2A6 is one of the enzymes involved in the hepatic metabolism of a naturally produced compound, skatole, in the pig. Low CYP2A6 activity has been linked to excessive accumulation of skatole in pig adipose tissue and development of the phenomenon ""boar taint."" CYP2A6 activity varies between male and female animals, suggesting the involvement of sex hormones in regulation of the enzyme activity and/or expression. The present study investigated whether pig hepatic CYP2A6 protein expression is regulated by the testicular steroids testosterone, androstenone, or estrone sulfate using primary cultured hepatocytes as a model system. The study has also examined whether CYP2A6 expression can be modulated by the boar taint compounds skatole and indole. The research has established that androstenone inhibits CYP2A6 protein expression at the concentration of 1, 10, and 100 nM by 55, 37, and 44%, respectively. In contrast to androstenone, skatole and indole (final concentrations, 1, 10, and 100 nM) had a stimulatory effect on CYP2A6 expression. The effect of indole was more pronounced than that of skatole (maximum induction by 145 and 70%, respectively). Estrone sulfate and testosterone did not have a significant effect on CYP2A6 protein level. This is, as far as we know, the first communication to report the regulation of pig hepatic CYP2A6 expression by steroids and boar taint compounds. The hormonal modulation of CYP2A6 expression might contribute to gender-related differences in pig hepatic CYP2A6 activity and skatole accumulation in pig adipose tissue."
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in many human cancers. We generated a bronchioalveolar epithelium-specific null mutation of Pten in mice [SP-C-rtTA/(tetO)(7)-Cre/Pten(flox/flox) (SOPten(flox/flox)) mice] that was under the control of doxycycline. Ninety percent of SOPten(flox/flox) mice that received doxycycline in utero [SOPten(flox/flox)(E10-16) mice] died of hypoxia soon after birth. Surviving SOPten(flox/flox)(E10-16) mice and mice that received doxycycline postnatally [SOPten(flox/flox)(P21-27) mice] developed spontaneous lung adenocarcinomas. Urethane treatment accelerated number and size of lung tumors developing in SOPten(flox/flox) mice of both ages. Histological and biochemical examinations of the lungs of SOPten(flox/flox)(E10-16) mice revealed hyperplasia of bronchioalveolar epithelial cells and myofibroblast precursors, enlarged alveolar epithelial cells, and impaired production of surfactant proteins. Numbers of bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs), putative initiators of lung adenocarcinomas, were increased. Lungs of SOPten(flox/flox)(E10-16) mice showed increased expression of Spry2, which inhibits the maturation of alveolar epithelial cells. Levels of Akt, c-Myc, Bcl-2, and Shh were also elevated in SOPten(flox/flox)(E10-16) and SOPten(flox/flox)(P21-27) lungs. Furthermore, K-ras was frequently mutated in adenocarcinomas observed in SOPten(flox/flox)(P21-27) lungs. These results indicate that Pten is essential for both normal lung morphogenesis and the prevention of lung carcinogenesis, possibly because this tumor suppressor is required for BASC homeostasis.
PNP deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by severe combined immunodeficiency, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and by a complex of neurologic manifestations including ataxia, developmental delay, and spasticity. PNP protein catalyzes the phosphorolysis of deoxyinosine and deoxyguanosine. It is found in most tissues of the body but is expressed at the highest levels in lymphoid tissues. This tissue distribution explains why the lymphoid system is predominantly affected in PNP deficiency. We describe a five-yr-old boy with muscular hypertonia, impaired growth, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and neutropenia who underwent HSCT from his HLA-identical sister. One yr post-HSCT, the boy developed normal immunological functions, and his neurological status improved.
CYP2A13 is an efficient catalyst of metabolic activation of the human carcinogens 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN). This study investigated the functional consequences of CYP2A13 polymorphisms that result in single amino acid substitutions. Five CYP2A13 variants, namely CYP2A13*2 (R257C), CYP2A13*5 (F453Y), CYP2A13*6 (R494C), CYP2A13*8 (D158E), and CYP2A13*9 (V323L), were expressed and evaluated for coumarin binding affinity, coumarin 7-hydroxylation, and -hydroxylation of (S)-NNN and NNK. In addition, the 133_134 Thr deletion variant, coded for by CYP2A13*3, was expressed but was not stable to the protein purification procedure. A 30-42% decrease in coumarin 7-hydroxylation catalytic efficiency was determined for R257C and D158E. No effect on coumarin binding or (S)-NNN metabolism was observed. Three variants, R257C, D158E, and V323L, had two- to threefold decreased catalytic efficiency for NNK -hydroxylation. CYP2A13 polymorphisms resulted in modest changes in coumarin 7-hydroxylation and NNK -hydroxylation activities in vitro. Although these changes are not likely to impact in vivo metabolism, these data should aid in the interpretation and design of future epidemiology studies.
CD36 is a multifunctional membrane receptor and a cell-adhesion molecule that is expressed in platelets, monocytes/macrophages, microvascular endothelial cells, cardiac monocytes and adipocytes. In this study, we investigated whether genetic polymorphisms of the CD36 gene are associated with risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in a Korean population.
MTHFR gene variants C677T and A1298C seem to be related to an increased risk of migraine. Folates' metabolism could play a role in the pathophysiology of migraine. We supplemented 16 children with migraine, hyperhomocysteinemia, and MTHFR polymorphisms with folic acid and obtained a resolution/reduction of migraine attacks. Although the mechanism leading to these effects has been not made clear, we believe that the use of folic acid needs further investigations in migraineurs with hyperhomocysteinemia and MTHFR variants. A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover trial is needed to support these findings.
"CD38 controls the chemotaxis of leukocytes to some, but not all, chemokines, suggesting that chemokine receptor signaling in leukocytes is more diverse than previously appreciated. To determine the basis for this signaling heterogeneity, we examined the chemokine receptors that signal in a CD38-dependent manner and identified a novel ""alternative"" chemokine receptor signaling pathway. Similar to the ""classical"" signaling pathway, the alternative chemokine receptor pathway is activated by Galpha(i2)-containing Gi proteins. However, unlike the classical pathway, the alternative pathway is also dependent on the Gq class of G proteins. We show that Galpha(q)-deficient neutrophils and dendritic cells (DCs) make defective calcium and chemotactic responses upon stimulation with N-formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine and CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 3 (neutrophils), or upon stimulation with CCL2, CCL19, CCL21, and CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) 12 (DCs). In contrast, Galpha(q)-deficient T cell responses to CXCL12 and CCL19 remain intact. Thus, the alternative chemokine receptor pathway controls the migration of only a subset of cells. Regardless, the novel alternative chemokine receptor signaling pathway appears to be critically important for the initiation of inflammatory responses, as Galpha(q) is required for the migration of DCs from the skin to draining lymph nodes after fluorescein isothiocyanate sensitization and the emigration of monocytes from the bone marrow into inflamed skin after contact sensitization."
GK (glucokinase) catalyses the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate in glucosensitive cells. In pancreatic beta-cells, this reaction is the rate-limiting step of insulin release. Recent work has led to the discovery of synthetic small-molecule activators of GK that stimulate beta-cell physiology and subsequently enhance the glucose-dependent release of insulin. It is currently recognized that these compounds may represent a significant advance in the development of new agents in the treatment of diabetes. In addition, GKAs (GK activators) are emerging as reagents that are useful tools with which to probe the function of pancreatic beta-cells and other glucosensitive cells. This includes providing insights into the physiology of the beta-cell by helping to elucidate the kinetic cycle of GK, confirming the central role of glucose metabolism to the beta-cell and highlighting subtle species-dependent differences in insulin secretion between rodent and human islets of Langerhans.
ABO genotyping is complicated by the remarkable diversity at the ABO locus. Recombination or gene conversion between common alleles may lead to hybrids resulting in unexpected ABO phenotypes. Furthermore, numerous mutations associated with weak subgroups and nondeletional null alleles should be considered. All known ABO genotyping methods, however, risk incorrect phenotype predictions if any such alleles are present.
CYP1A1 homology models based on the CYP2C5 and a composite of CYP2C5, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9 X-ray crystal structures were compared to a model generated using the recently published coordinates of CYP1A2. The model using the CYP1A2 coordinates, CYP1A1-(1A2), gave near ideal stereochemical quality and was favored energetically. Docking studies identified the active-site residues potentially involved in binding of the prototypic CYP1A1 substrate 7-ethoxyresorufin. CYP1A1 mutants S122A, F123A, F224A, A317Y, T321G, and I386G were generated to explore the roles of these residues in 7-ethoxyresorufin binding and turnover, and generally confirmed the importance of aromatic interactions over hydrogen bonding in orientating 7-ethoxyresrufin in a catalytically favorable orientation. Although 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation by CYP1A1 and several mutants exhibited substrate inhibition, it is unlikely that inhibition arises from the simultaneous binding of two substrates within the active-site given the geometry of the active site-cavity.
G6PD deficiency is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases in Lebanon (1% in Lebanese males). Easy and effective screening methods exist to detect this deficiency early in newborns.
CYP2A6 is the major enzyme involved in nicotine metabolism, yet large interindividual variations in the rate of nicotine metabolism exist within groups of individuals having the same CYP2A6 genotype. We investigated the influence of genetic variation in another potential nicotine-metabolizing enzyme, CYP2B6, and its interaction with CYP2A6, on the metabolism of nicotine.
UGT1A1 coding region mutations, including UGT1A1*6 (G71R), UGT1A1*7 (Y486D), UGT1A1*27 (P229Q) and UGT1A1*62 (F83L), have been linked to Gilbert syndrome in Asian populations, whereas homozygosity for UGT1A1*7 is associated with the Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II. This work compared the effects of (a) the individual UGT1A1 mutations on the glucuronidation kinetics bilirubin, beta-estradiol, 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) and 1-naphthol (1NP), and (b) the Y486 mutation, which occurs in the conserved carboxyl terminal domain of UGT1A enzymes, on 4MU, 1NP and naproxen glucuronidation by UGT1A3, UGT1A6 and UGT1A10.
GPI anchor attachment is catalyzed by the GPI transamidase (GPIT) complex. GAA1, PIG-T and PIG-U are the three of five GPIT subunits. Previous studies demonstrated amplification and overexpression of GPIT subunits in bladder and breast cancer with oncogenic function. We performed an analysis of these subunits in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
UROS (uroporphyrinogen III synthase; EC 4.2.1.75) is the enzyme responsible for the formation of uroporphyrinogen III, the precursor of all cellular tetrapyrroles including haem, chlorophyll and bilins. Although UROS genes have been cloned from many organisms, the level of sequence conservation between them is low, making sequence similarity searches difficult. As an alternative approach to identify the UROS gene from plants, we used functional complementation, since this does not require conservation of primary sequence. A mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was constructed in which the HEM4 gene encoding UROS was deleted. This mutant was transformed with an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library in a yeast expression vector and two colonies were obtained that could grow in the absence of haem. The rescuing plasmids encoded an ORF (open reading frame) of 321 amino acids which, when subcloned into an Escherichia coli expression vector, was able to complement an E. coli hemD mutant defective in UROS. Final proof that the ORF encoded UROS came from the fact that the recombinant protein expressed with an N-terminal histidine-tag was found to have UROS activity. Comparison of the sequence of AtUROS (A. thaliana UROS) with the human enzyme found that the seven invariant residues previously identified were conserved, including three shown to be important for enzyme activity. Furthermore, a structure-based homology search of the protein database with AtUROS identified the human crystal structure. AtUROS has an N-terminal extension compared with orthologues from other organisms, suggesting that this might act as a targeting sequence. The precursor protein of 34 kDa translated in vitro was imported into isolated chloroplasts and processed to the mature size of 29 kDa. Confocal microscopy of plant cells transiently expressing a fusion protein of AtUROS with GFP (green fluorescent protein) confirmed that AtUROS was targeted exclusively to chloroplasts in vivo.
UCP2 and UCP3 are members of the uncoupling protein family, which may play roles in energy homeostasis. In order to determine the regulation of the predominant expression of UCP3 in skeletal muscle, the effects of differentiation and myogenic regulatory factors on the promoter activities of the mouse UCP2 and UCP3 genes were studied. Reporter plasmids, containing approximately 3 kb of the 5'-upstream region of the mouse UCP2 and UCP3 genes, were transfected into C2C12 myoblasts, which were then induced to differentiate. Differentiation positively induced the reporter expression about 20-fold via the UCP3 promoter, but by only 2-fold via the UCP2 promoter. C2C12 myoblasts were cotransfected with expression vectors for myogenin and/or MyoD as well as reporter constructs. The simultaneous expression of myogenin and MyoD caused an additional 20-fold increase in the reporter expression via the UCP3 promoter, but only a weak effect via the UCP2 promoter. In L6 myoblasts, only MyoD activated the UCP3 promoter, but in 3T3-L1 cells neither factor activated the UCP3 promoter, indicating that additional cofactors are required, which are present only in C2C12 myoblasts. The expression of UCP2 and UCP3 is differentially regulated during muscle differentiation due to the different responsiveness of their promoter regions to myogenin and MyoD.
CD38 is involved in normal airway function, IL-13-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and is also regulated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. This study aimed to determine whether TNF-alpha-induced CD38 upregulation in ASM cells contributes to AHR, a hallmark of asthma. We hypothesized that AHR would be attenuated in TNF-alpha-exposed CD38-deficient (CD38KO) mice compared with wild-type (WT) controls. Mice (n = 6-8/group) were intranasally challenged with vehicle control or TNF-alpha (50 ng) once and every other day during 1 or 4 wk. Lung inflammation and AHR, measured by changes in lung resistance after inhaled methacholine, were assessed 24 h following the last challenge. Tracheal rings were incubated with TNF-alpha (50 ng/ml) to assess contractile changes in the ASM. While a single TNF-alpha challenge caused no airway inflammation, both multiple-challenge protocols induced equally significant inflammation in CD38KO and WT mice. A single intranasal TNF-alpha challenge induced AHR in the WT but not in the CD38KO mice, whereas both mice developed AHR after 1 wk of challenges. The AHR was suppressed by extending the challenges for 4 wk in both mice, although to a larger magnitude in the WT than in the CD38KO mice. TNF-alpha increased ASM contractile properties in tracheal rings from WT but not from CD38KO mice. In conclusion, CD38 contributes to TNF-alpha-induced AHR after a brief airway exposure to the cytokine, likely by mediating changes in ASM contractile responses, and is associated with greater AHR remission following chronic airway exposure to TNF-alpha. The mechanisms involved in this remission remain to be determined.
G6PD deficiency mutational profile and haplotype diversity using 6 RFLPs (FokI/PvuII/BspHI/PstI/BclI/NlaIII) and a (CTT)(n) microsatellite, were investigated in 70 G6PD-deficient Portuguese individuals. All but one G6PD A-(376G/202A) variants (44/45) have a single haplotype (+/+/-/+/-/+/195). G6PD Betica(376G/968C) alleles (n=10) have a single RFLP haplotype (+/-/-/+/-/+) and 4 different (CTT)(n) repeats. Age estimates based on microsatellite variation suggest that Betica mutation arose 900 generations ago. G6PD SantaMaria(376G/542T) allele was found on haplotype (+/-/-/+/-/+/201) and 10 G6PD variants on RFLP haplotypes (-/-/+/+/-/-), (-/-/+/+/-/+) and (-/-/+/+/+/+).
CYP2E1 metabolizes many low-molecular weight toxins and carcinogens. Some in vitro experiments suggest that CYP2E1 may be involved in the metabolic activation of diethylnitrosamine. However, there has been no direct evidence demonstrating a role for CYP2E1 in diethylnitrosamine-mediated carcinogenesis in vivo. To clarify this, we carried out a diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis experiment using Cyp2e1-null mice. Male 14-day-old wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice were treated with diethylnitrosamine (10 mg/kg of body weight) and killed at weeks 24 and 36 after diethylnitrosamine treatment for investigation of tumors and at 6, 24, and 48 h for examination of apoptosis and gene expression. Liver weights of Cyp2e1-null mice were significantly different at weeks 24 and 36 compared with wild-type mice (P < 0.01). Liver tumor incidences of Cyp2e1-null mice were significantly decreased at weeks 24 and 36 compared with wild-type mice (P < 0.01). Cyp2e1-null mice showed significant decrease in the multiplicities of hepatocellular adenoma at weeks 24 and 36 (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), and of hepatocellular carcinoma at week 36 (P < 0.01) compared with wild-type mice. Apoptotic index and caspase-3 and/or Bax mRNA expression of Cyp2e1-null mice were significantly different at 6, 24, and 48 h after diethylnitrosamine treatment compared with wild-type mice (P < 0.05). We conclude that Cyp2e1-null mice show lower tumor incidence and multiplicity compared with wild-type mice in diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. It is suggested that CYP2E1 completely participates in diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, and high frequency of tumors in wild-type mice could be associated with the increased apoptosis.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is a tumor suppressor that can inhibit proliferation and migration and controls apoptosis in a number of cell types, mainly through inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Patients carrying inactivating mutations of PTEN show a prevalence to develop tumors that can coincide with neurological defects such as mental retardation, ataxia and seizures. A number of in vitro and in vivo studies were instrumental in uncovering a direct correlation between deregulated PI3K/PTEN signaling and changes in neuronal morphogenesis, which is likely to have profound bearings upon the pathogenesis of neurological symptoms. This review outlines recent work on the function of PTEN during vertebrate brain development and the current understanding of the signaling pathways downstream of PTEN that control neuronal connectivity in the brain.
AKR1B10 is a human aldo-keto reductase (AKR) found to be elevated in several cancer types and in precancerous lesions. In vitro, AKR1B10 exhibits a much higher retinaldehyde reductase activity than any other human AKR, including AKR1B1 (aldose reductase). We here demonstrate that AKR1B10 also acts as a retinaldehyde reductase in vivo. This activity may be relevant in controlling the first step of retinoic acid synthesis. Up-regulation of AKR1B10, resulting in retinoic acid depletion, may lead to cellular proliferation. Both in vitro and in vivo activities of AKR1B10 were inhibited by tolrestat, an AKR1B1 inhibitor developed for diabetes treatment. The crystal structure of the ternary complex AKR1B10-NADP(+)-tolrestat was determined at 1.25-A resolution. Molecular dynamics models of AKR1B10 and AKR1B1 with retinaldehyde isomers and site-directed mutagenesis show that subtle differences at the entrance of the retinoid-binding site, especially at position 125, are determinant for the all-trans-retinaldehyde specificity of AKR1B10. Substitutions in the retinaldehyde cyclohexene ring also influence the specificity. These structural features should facilitate the design of specific inhibitors, with potential use in cancer and diabetes treatments.
"CLC Cl(-)/H(+) exchangers are homodimers with Cl(-)-binding and H(+)-coupling residues contained within each subunit. It is not known whether the transport mechanism requires conformational rearrangement between subunits or whether each subunit operates as a separate exchanger. We designed various cysteine substitution mutants on a cysteine-less background of CLC-ec1, a bacterial CLC exchanger of known structure, with the aim of covalently linking the subunits. The constructs were cross-linked in air or with exogenous oxidant, and the cross-linked proteins were reconstituted to assess their function. In addition to conventional disulfides, a cysteine-lysine cross-bridge was formed with I(2) as an oxidant. The constructs, all of which contained one, two, or four cross-bridges, were functionally active and kinetically competent with respect to Cl(-) turnover rate, Cl(-)/H(+) exchange stoichiometry, and H(+) pumping driven by a Cl(-) gradient. These results imply that large quaternary rearrangements, such as those known to occur for ""common gating"" in CLC channels, are not necessary for the ion transport cycle and that it is therefore likely that the transport mechanism is carried out by the subunits working individually, as with ""fast gating"" of the CLC channels."
CYP2E1 is recognized as the most important enzyme for initiation of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced toxicity. In this study, the resistance of Cyp2e1-null mice to APAP treatment was confirmed by comparing serum aminotransferase activities and blood urea nitrogen levels in wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice. However, unexpectedly, profiling of major known APAP metabolites in urine and serum revealed that the contribution of CYP2E1 to APAP metabolism decreased with increasing APAP doses administered. Measurement of hepatic glutathione and hydrogen peroxide levels exposed the importance of oxidative stress in determining the consequence of APAP overdose. Subsequent metabolomic analysis was capable of constructing a principal components analysis (PCA) model that delineated a relationship between urinary metabolomes and the responses to APAP treatment. Urinary ions high in wild-type mice treated with 400 mg/kg APAP were elucidated as 3-methoxy-APAP glucuronide (VII) and three novel APAP metabolites, including S-(5-acetylamino-2-hydroxyphenyl)mercaptopyruvic acid (VI, formed by a Cys-APAP transamination reaction in kidney), 3,3'-biacetaminophen (VIII, an APAP dimer), and a benzothiazine compound (IX, originated from deacetylated APAP), through mass isotopomer analysis, accurate mass measurement, tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation, in vitro reactions, and chemical treatments. Dose-, time-, and genotype-dependent appearance of these minor APAP metabolites implied their association with the APAP-induced toxicity and potential biomarker application. Overall, the oxidative stress elicited by CYP2E1-mediated APAP metabolism might significantly contribute to APAP-induced toxicity. The combination of genetically modified animal models, mass isotopomer analysis, and metabolomics provides a powerful and efficient technical platform to characterize APAP-induced toxicity through identifying novel biomarkers and unraveling novel mechanisms.
ABO genotyping is a useful tool in case of ABO discrepancies and in legal medicine. Recent knowledge of various alleles in the ABO gene has led to the need of a different method that can cover numerous polymorphisms. We performed a polymerase chain reaction using sequencespecific priming (PCR-SSP) with 12 primer sets and evaluated its value in the detection of 8 ABO alleles.
NSF is a new and emerging disease. Significant investigative work to date has led to an unexpected suspect-gadolinium-containing contrast agents. Considerable additional work is now underway to formulate specific recommendations about the use of these agents in the population of patients who have renal disease. Goals on the immediate research horizon include (1) the identification of risk factors and conditions that must be met to permit the development of NSF in patients who have renal disease, (2) the characteristics of contrast agents that make them more or less likely to induce NSF, and (3) the development of prophylactic or treatment strategies that can reduce the overall development and severity of NSF. The investigative process has already yielded new insight into the functions (and malfunctions) of the CF in the setting of NSF. As the CF is being increasingly implicated in other organ-specific and systemic fibrosing disorders, we can expect to see significant developments in the studies of allied disorders as well.
ABCA1 plays an important role in HDL metabolism. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABCA1 gene were associated with variation in plasma HDL-c.
CYP2B6 is a polymorphic human drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 with clinical relevance for several drug substrates including cyclophosphamide, bupropion, and efavirenz. The common allele CYP2B6*6 [c. 516G>T, Q172H, and c.785A>G, K262R] has previously been associated with lower expression in human liver and with increased plasma levels of efavirenz in human immunodeficiency virus patients, but the molecular mechanism has remained unclear. We present novel data showing that hepatic CYP2B6 mRNA levels are reduced in *6 carriers, suggesting a pretranslational mechanism resulting in decreased expression. As one possibility, we first analyzed the common promoter variant, -750T>C, but the results did not suggest a prominent role in phenotype determination. In contrast, analysis of liver mRNA splicing variants demonstrated that the most common form lacking exons 4 to 6 (SV1) was tightly associated with the *6 allele and apparently also with the rare variant c.777C>A(CYP2B6*3). Further investigation using minigene constructs transfected into eukaryotic cell lines COS-1 and Huh7 demonstrated that the single nucleotide polymorphism c.516G>T in allele CYP2B6*6 was alone responsible for aberrant splicing resulting in high-splice variant (SV) 1 and low-CYP2B6 expression phenotype. Minigenes carrying the single c.785A>G polymorphism or the rare c.777C>A variant resulted in normal and intermediate expression phenotypes, respectively. In conclusion, the mechanism of the common *6 allele involves predominantly aberrant splicing, thus leading to reduced functional mRNA, protein, and activity. These results establish the single nucleotide polymorphism 516G>Tasthe causal sequence variation for severely decreased expression and function associated with CYP2B6*6.
PTEN and the pan phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1 benzopyran-4-one (LY294002) exert significant control over tumor-induced angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. The LY294002 compound is not a viable drug candidate due to poor pharmacologic variables of insolubility and short half-life. Herein, we describe the development and antitumor activity of a novel RGDS-conjugated LY294002 prodrug, termed SF1126, which is designed to exhibit increased solubility and bind to specific integrins within the tumor compartment, resulting in enhanced delivery of the active compound to the tumor vasculature and tumor. SF1126 is water soluble, has favorable pharmacokinetics, and is well tolerated in murine systems. The capacity of SF1126 to inhibit U87MG and PC3 tumor growth was enhanced by the RGDS integrin (alpha v beta 3/alpha 5 beta 1) binding component, exhibiting increased activity compared with a false RADS-targeted prodrug, SF1326. Antitumor activity of SF1126 was associated with the pharmacokinetic accumulation of SF1126 in tumor tissue and the pharmacodynamic knockdown of phosphorylated AKT in vivo. Furthermore, SF1126 seems to exhibit both antitumor and antiangiogenic activity. The results support SF1126 as a viable pan PI3K inhibitor for phase I clinical trials in cancer and provide support for a new paradigm, the application of pan PI3K inhibitory prodrugs for the treatment of cancer.
LPL is an enzyme involved in the breakdown and uptake of lipoprotein triglycerides. In the present study, we examined how the transgenic (Tg) overexpression of human LPL in mouse skeletal muscle affected tolerance to cold temperatures, cold-induced thermogenesis, and fuel utilization during this response. Tg mice and their nontransgenic controls were placed in an environmental chamber and housed in metabolic chambers that monitored oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production with calorimetry. When exposed to 4 degrees C, an attenuation in the decline in body temperature in Tg mice was accompanied by an increased metabolic rate (15%; P < 0.001) and a reduction in respiratory quotient (P < 0.05). Activity levels, the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown fat and muscle, and lean mass failed to explain the enhanced cold tolerance and thermogenesis in Tg mice. The more oxidative type IIa fibers were favored over the more glycolytic type IIb fibers (P < 0.001) in the gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscles of Tg mice. These data suggest that Tg overexpression of LPL in skeletal muscle increases cold tolerance by enhancing the capacity for fat oxidation, producing an avian-like phenotype in which skeletal muscle contributes significantly to the thermogenic response to cold temperatures.
PIK3CA codes for a Class IA p110-alpha catalytic subunit of the PI3Ks (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases) that regulate various signaling pathways important for neoplasia, including cell proliferation, motility, adhesion, and survival. Pro-oncogenic mutations in exons 9 and 20 of the PIK3CA gene have been frequently observed in numerous types of human malignancies. Amplification of the PIK3CA gene has been reported in uterine cervical cancers. In this study, we have done in depth analysis of uterine cervical and endometrial cancers for PIK3CA gene mutations and amplifications. In uterine cervical cancers, PIK3CA mutations were found in 3 of 22 cases (14%), all of them in exon 9. In endometrial cancers, a similar incidence of mutations was found, in 3 of 29 cases (10%), however they were all within exon 20. Amplification of the PIK3CA gene was also detected in 2 out of 22 (9%) cervical cancers and 3 out of 29 (10%) endometrial cancers. In this study, we were unable to find a clear association between PIK3CA mutations and gene amplifications, nor with tumor histological subtypes or staging. Mutations and amplifications of the PIK3CA gene are relatively infrequent in human cervical and endometrial cancers; however, PIK3CA gene alteration may still play a role in some subset of uterine cancers.
ABCG2 is a half-transporter which causes multidrug resistance when overexpressed in tumor cells. Availability of combined localization and functional assays would greatly improve cell biology and drug modulation studies for this transporter. Here we demonstrate that an N-terminally GFP-tagged version of the protein (GFP-G2) can be used to directly monitor ABCG2 expression, dimerization, localization and function in living cells. GFP-G2 is fully functional when tested for drug-stimulated ATPase activity, vesicular transport assay, subcellular localization or cell surface epitope conformational changes. By measuring both GFP and Hoechst 33342 dye fluorescence in HEK-293 cells, we provide evidence that a real-time transport assay can be reliably applied to identify ABCG2 substrates, transport modulators, as well as to monitor the cellular functions of this multidrug transporter protein. This approach also avoids the need of cloning, drug selection or other further separation or characterization of the transgene-expressing cells.
CYP2D6 levels are higher in many brain regions of human smokers in comparison with nonsmokers. We have shown that CYP2D is expressed in rat brain regions and that enzyme activities correlate with protein and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels. The aims of this study were to investigate whether nicotine can induce rat brain CYP2D, to determine the recovery time course of the induction and to investigate the mechanism of induction through measuring mRNA levels over time.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in many human sporadic cancers and in hereditary cancer syndromes such as Cowden disease. The major substrate of PTEN is phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), a second messenger molecule produced following PI3K activation induced by a variety of stimuli. PI(3,4,5)P3 activates the serine-threonine kinase Akt, which is involved in antiapoptosis, proliferation and oncogenesis. In mice, heterozygosity for a null mutation of Pten (Pten(+/-)mice) frequently leads to the development of a variety of cancers and autoimmune disease. Homozygosity for the null mutation (Pten(-/-) mice) results in early embryonic lethality, precluding the functional analysis of Pten in adult tissues and organs. To investigate the physiological functions of Pten in viable mice, we and other groups have used the Cre-loxP system to generate various tissue-specific Pten mutations. The present review will summarize results obtained from the study of conditional mutant mice lacking Pten in specific tissues, and discuss the possible biological and molecular explanations for why Pten deficiency leads to tumorigenesis.
PTEN encodes a major tumor-suppressor protein that is a dual-specificity phosphatase. Inactivation of PTEN has been shown to be involved in heritable and sporadic cancers. Mutation or deletion of PTEN, historically the most commonly identified mechanisms of inactivation of tumor suppressors, is found only in the minority of sporadic non-cultured primary cancers, which indicates that there might be other, novel mechanisms of inactivation. Despite the absence of a classic nuclear localization signal, PTEN enters the nucleus by several mechanisms, including simple diffusion, active shuttling, cytoplasmic-localization-signal-dependent export and monoubiquitylation-dependent import. Cytoplasmic PTEN has a well-known role as a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway; however, it is becoming clear that cytosolic PTEN is not the same as nuclear PTEN. Nuclear PTEN plays a role in chromosome stability, DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and cellular stability. The balance between these functions is an important factor in determining whether a cell remains benign or becomes neoplastic.
CYP2A6 is the main enzyme involved in nicotine metabolism in humans. We have identified a novel allele, CYP2A6*23 (2161C>T, R203C), in individuals of Black-African descent and investigated its impact on enzyme activity and association with smoking status.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is a tumor suppressor that is mutated or deleted in a variety of human tumors, and even loss of only one PTEN gene profoundly affects carcinogenesis. PTEN encodes a phosphatidylinositol phosphate phosphatase specific for the 3-position of the inositol ring. Despite its importance, we are just beginning to understand the regulatory circuits that maintain the correct levels of PTEN phosphatase activity. Several independent studies reported that PI(4,5)P2 enhances PTEN phosphatase activity, but the reasons for this enhancement are currently being debated. In this study, PTEN bound to PI(4,5)P2-bearing vesicles has increased alpha-helicity, providing direct spectroscopic proof of a conformational change. Neither PI(3,5)P2 nor PI(3,4,5)P3 induced this conformational change. On the basis of experiments with two mutant PTEN proteins, it is shown that PI(4,5)P2 induces this conformational change by binding to the PTEN N-terminal domain. Using PTEN protein and a 21-amino acid peptide based on the PTEN N-terminus, we tested all natural phosphatidylinositol phosphates and found preferential binding of PI(4,5)P2. PTEN also binds to phosphatidylserine-bearing vesicles, resulting in a slight increase in beta-sheet content. In addition, PTEN binds synergistically to PI(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylserine, and hence, these anionic lipids do not compete for PTEN binding sites. Collectively, these results demonstrate that PTEN binds to membranes through multiple sites, but only PI(4,5)P2 binding to the N-terminal domain triggers a conformational change with increased alpha-helicity.
CYP2C19 is an important member of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme superfamily and plays a significant role in the drug metabolism. In order to gain insights for developing personalized drugs, the structure-activity relationships of two SNPs, W120R and I331V, with the ligands of CEC, Fluvoxamine, Lescol and Ticlopidine were investigated through the structure-activity relationship approach. By means of a series of docking studies, the binding pockets of the two SNPs for the four compounds are explicitly defined that will be very useful for conducting mutagenesis studies, providing insights into personalization of drug treatments and stimulating novel strategies for finding desired personalized drugs.
ABCB4 (MDR3), a lipid translocator, moves phosphatidylcholine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane. Genetic mutations of ABCB4 lead to three distinct but related hepatobiliary diseases. Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) type 3 is a chronic cholestatic syndrome characterized by a markedly elevated gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. Patients present with jaundice, pruritus, and hepatosplenomegaly. Periportal inflammation progresses to biliary cirrhosis and causes portal hypertension. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) normalizes liver function tests in approximately one half of treated PFIC type 3 patients. Partial responders or nonresponders eventually will require liver transplantation. Gallstone patients with ABCB4 mutations may have low phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis syndrome, characterized by cholesterol gallstones and intrahepatic microlithiasis, along with recurrent biliary symptoms, despite cholecystectomy. Patients with ABCB4 mutations also may develop intrahepatic brown pigment stones. UDCA may improve biliary symptoms even before the dissolution of stones occurs. Additional therapies such as farnesoid X receptor ligands/agonists and benzfibrates show future therapeutic promise. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy affects pregnant women with abnormal ABCB4. These women suffer from disabling pruritus and also may experience steatorrhea. Fetuses are at high risk for prematurity and stillbirths. The definitive treatment is delivery of the baby. In the interim, limited fat intake, fat-soluble vitamin supplementation, and UDCA with or without S-adenosylmethionine can provide symptomatic relief. Additional hepatobiliary diseases related to ABCB4 mutations are likely to be identified. This may result in the discovery of additional therapies for PFIC type 3, gallstones, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.
CD38 is a surface receptor able to induce activation, proliferation, and survival of human and mouse lymphocytes; this molecule is expressed on the surface of both mature and immature B cells. In this work, the function of CD38 in the maturation of murine B lymphocytes in the spleen was analyzed. The results showed that CD38 is highly expressed on Transitional 2 (T2) B lymphocytes with an intermediate expression on Transitional 1 (T1) and mature follicular B cells (M). Correlating with a high expression of CD38, T2 cells are also larger and more granular than T1 or M B cells. T2 cells also showed high levels of other molecules, which indicate an activated phenotype. CD38 crosslinking induced proliferation and maturation of T2 B lymphocytes; in contrast, T1 subset died by apoptosis. Finally, CD38 stimulation of T2 B lymphocytes obtained from Btk-, Lyn-, or Fyn-deficient mice showed a defective differentiation; similarly, drugs interfering with PI3K or ERK decreased the proliferation or differentiation of this subset. This suggests that these molecules participate in the CD38 signaling pathway. As a whole, the results indicate that CD38 plays an important role in the regulation of B-cell maturation in the spleen.
ABCG2 is a ubiquitous ATP-binding cassette transmembrane protein that is important in pharmacology and may play a role in stem cell biology and clinical drug resistance. To study the mechanism(s) regulating ABCG2 expression, we used ChIP to investigate the levels of acetylated histone H3, histone deacetylases (HDAC), histone acetyltransferases, and other transcription regulatory proteins associated with the ABCG2 promoter. Following selection for drug resistance and the subsequent overexpression of ABCG2, an increase in acetylated histone H3 but a decrease in class I HDACs associated with the ABCG2 promoter was observed. Permissive histone modifications, including an increase in histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (Me(3)-K4 H3) and histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation (P-S10 H3), were observed accompanying development of the resistance phenotype. These changes mirrored those in some cell lines treated with a HDAC inhibitor, romidepsin. A repressive histone mark, trimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (Me(3)-K9 H3), was found in untreated parental cells and cells that did not respond to HDAC inhibition with ABCG2 up-regulation. Interestingly, although all five studied cell lines showed global histone acetylation and MDR1 up-regulation upon HDAC inhibition, only those cells with removal of the repressive mark, and recruitment of RNA polymerase II and a chromatin remodeling factor Brg-1 from the ABCG2 promoter, showed increased ABCG2 expression. In the remaining cell lines, HDAC1 binding in association with the repressive Me3-K9 H3 mark apparently constrains the effect of HDAC inhibition on ABCG2 expression. These studies begin to address the differential effect of HDAC inhibitors widely observed in gene expression studies.
MTAP (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase) catalyses the reversible phosphorolytic cleavage of methylthioadenosine leading to the production of methylthioribose-1-phosphate and adenine. Deficient MTAP activity has been correlated with human diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the present study we have investigated the regulation of MTAP by ROS (reactive oxygen species). The results of the present study support the inactivation of MTAP in the liver of bacterial LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-challenged mice as well as in HepG2 cells after exposure to t-butyl hydroperoxide. Reversible inactivation of purified MTAP by hydrogen peroxide results from a reduction of V(max) and involves the specific oxidation of Cys(136) and Cys(223) thiols to sulfenic acid that may be further stabilized to sulfenyl amide intermediates. Additionally, we found that Cys(145) and Cys(211) were disulfide bonded upon hydrogen peroxide exposure. However, this modification is not relevant to the mediation of the loss of MTAP activity as assessed by site-directed mutagenesis. Regulation of MTAP by ROS might participate in the redox regulation of the methionine catabolic pathway in the liver. Reduced MTA (5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine)-degrading activity may compensate for the deficient production of the precursor S-adenosylmethionine, allowing maintenance of intracellular MTA levels that may be critical to ensure cellular adaptation to physiopathological conditions such as inflammation.
ABO blood groups greatly influence circulating von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels, and O group subjects have lower VWF values. In this study, we investigated whether ABO groups affect VWF survival by monitoring the post-DDAVP (1-desamino-8-d arginine vasopressin) time courses of VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), VWF collagen binding (VWF:CB), and factor VIII (FVIII) in 47 healthy subjects (28 O and 19 non-O blood groups). The elimination half-life (T1/2el) of VWF was found significantly shorter in O than in non-O subjects (10.0+/-0.8 hours vs 25.5+/-5.3 hours, respectively; P<.01), as was the T1/2el of VWF:CB (7.9+/-0.5 hours vs 20.9+/-4.5 hours; P<.01). A direct linear correlation was found between basal VWF:Ag and T1/2el, subjects with higher VWF levels having longer-surviving VWF. ABO blood groups appeared to strongly influence VWF clearance, but not its synthesis or release from endothelial cells. The VWF propeptide to VWF:Ag ratio, useful for predicting an increased VWF clearance, was found significantly higher in O than in non-O individuals (1.6+/-0.1 vs 1.2+/-0.5, P<.001), with values that correlated inversely with T1/2el (P<.001). Based on these findings, we conclude that the lower VWF values in O group individuals is attributable to a shorter VWF survival and circulating VWF values are strongly influenced by its half-life.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene but whether cancer can develop in all PTEN-deficient cells is not known. In T cell-specific PTEN-deficient (tPTEN-/-) mice, which suffer from mature T cell lymphomas, we found that premalignancy, as defined by elevated AKT and senescence pathways, starts in immature T cell precursors and surprisingly not in mature T cells. Premalignancy only starts in 6-week-old mice and becomes much stronger in 9-week-old mice although PTEN is lost since birth. tPTEN-/- immature T cells do not become tumors, and senescence has no role in this model because these cells exist in a novel cell cycle state, expressing proliferating proteins but not proliferating to any significant degree. Instead, the levels of p27(kip1), which is lower in tPTEN-/- immature T cells and almost nonexistent in tPTEN-/- mature T cells, correlate with the proliferation capability of these cells. Interestingly, transient reduction of these cancer precursor cells in adult tPTEN-/- mice within a crucial time window significantly delayed lymphomas and mouse lethality. Thus, loss of PTEN alone is not sufficient for cells to become cancerous, therefore other developmental events are necessary for tumor formation.
CYP1B1 and CYP19 (aromatase) have been shown to be expressed in breast tumors. Both enzymes are efficient estrogen hydroxylases, indicating the potential for overlapping substrate and inhibitor specificity. We measured the inhibition properties of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) against CYP1B1-catalyzed hydroxylation of 17beta-estradiol (E2) to determine whether CYP1B1 affects the disposition of AIs. In addition, we estimated the frequency of coexpression of these enzymes in breast tumor epithelium. Immunohistochemical analyses of CYP19 and CYP1B1 in a panel of 29 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast showed epithelial cell staining for CYP19 in 76% and for CYP1B1 in 97% of the samples. Statistical analysis showed no significant correlation (0.33) for positive expression of CYP19 and CYP1B1 (p > 0.07). CYP1B1 inhibition was determined for two steroidal inhibitors: formestane and exemestane and five nonsteroidal inhibitors: aminoglutethimide, fadrozole, anastrozole, letrozole, and vorozole. Of the seven compounds tested, only vorozole exhibited inhibition of CYP1B1 activity with IC(50) values of 17 and 21 microM for 4-hydroxy estradiol and 2-hydroxy estradiol, respectively. The estimated K(i) values of vorozole for E2 4- and 2-hydroxylation were 7.26 and 6.84 microM, respectively. Spectrophotometric studies showed that vorozole was a type II inhibitor of CYP1B1. This study shows that with the exception of vorozole, the aromatase inhibitors are selective for CYP19 relative to CYP1B1. Thus, although both CYP19 and CYP1B1 are expressed in a high percentage of breast cancers, CYP1B1 is not a major determinant of the disposition of AIs.
CYP2C19 is an important enzyme for human drug metabolism, and it also participates in the metabolism of endogenous substrates, whereas the CYP2C18 enzyme is not expressed in human liver despite high mRNA expression. Mice transgenic for the human CYP2C18 and CYP2C19 genes were generated. Quantitative mRNA analysis showed CYP2C18 and CYP2C19 transcripts in liver, kidneys, and heart to be expressed in a sexually dimorphic manner, with male mice having 2- to 100-fold higher levels. Transcript levels in the small intestine were somewhat higher than liver but were similar in both sexes. Transgene mRNA expression was much lower in lung and brain and least in the heart. Immunoblotting using an antipeptide antiserum, reactive with human CYP2Cs and mouse CYP2C70, revealed increased immunoreactive protein in liver microsomes from heterozygous transgenic male mice and a concomitant increase in 5'-hydroxylation of R-omeprazole and S-mephenytoin intrinsic clearance, consistent with CYP2C19 overexpression. A CYP2C18-specific antiserum showed that this enzyme was not expressed in livers or kidneys from heterozygous transgenic mice, but the antiserum had high affinity for recombinant CYP2C18 expressed in COS-7 cells. It is concluded that 1) both the CYP2C18 and CYP2C19 genes are subject to sexually dimorphic regulation in murine liver, kidney, and heart; 2) the CYP2C18 protein is not expressed in murine liver or kidney despite high levels of the corresponding mRNA; and 3) this transgenic model may be suitable for studying sex-dependent regulation of the human CYP2C genes and possibly serve as an in vivo model for CYP2C19-dependent drug metabolism.
CYP3A4 converts cholesterol into 4beta-hydroxycholesterol. We have suggested that 4beta-hydroxycholesterol could be used as a clinical marker for CYP3A4 activity aiding in dose adjustments. The kinetics of 4beta-hydroxycholesterol formation is not known, however, and must be determined in order to establish under what conditions 4beta-hydroxycholesterol can be used as a CYP3A marker.
CYP3A5 genotype has no impact on the trough plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals on stable highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This is ascribed to a drug interaction, such that ritonavir by inhibiting CYP3A activity, may occlude the pharmacokinetic consequences of functional polymorphisms in the CYP3A5 gene. In the clinical setting, where lopinavir and ritonavir are always combined, CYP3A5 genotype is of no consequence on the trough plasma concentrations of these drugs.
CYP2D6 enzyme is implicated in the metabolism of drugs and nicotine. Genetic variability within CYP2D6, results in different CYP2D6 phenotypes. Inheritance of polymorphic CYP2D6 metabolizing enzyme is likely to be an important determinant of inter-individual variations in susceptibility to cancer. In this work, we have conducted a case control study in order to assess the role of CYP2D6*4 variant in bladder cancer development in a Tunisian cohort. A total of 80 patients with TCC of bladder cancer and 109 healthy controls were included in the present study. The frequency of CYP2D6*4 allele, characterized by loss of BstNI site, was observed in 8.25% of healthy volunteers and in 10.62% of patients. The CYP2D6*4/CYP2D6*4 genotype was observed in only 2.75% of controls and was absent in cases. In all group of patients, the CYP2D6*4 allele did not appear to influence bladder cancer susceptibility (p > 0.05). A similar result was obtained when we stratified cases group according to tobacco status. Conversely, patients carrying the BstNI site at the homozygous state, mostly combined as homozygous wild genotype, could be at more risk of bladder cancer invasiveness than those having the heterozygous genotype.
CLC genes are expressed in species from bacteria to human and encode Cl(-)-channels or Cl(-)/H(+)-exchangers. CLC proteins assemble to dimers, with each monomer containing an ion translocation pathway. Some mammalian isoforms need essential beta -subunits (barttin and Ostm1). Crystal structures of bacterial CLC Cl(-)/H(+)-exchangers, combined with transport analysis of mammalian and bacterial CLCs, yielded surprising insights into their structure and function. The large cytosolic carboxy-termini of eukaryotic CLCs contain CBS domains, which may modulate transport activity. Some of these have been crystallized. Mammals express nine CLC isoforms that differ in tissue distribution and subcellular localization. Some of these are plasma membrane Cl(-) channels, which play important roles in transepithelial transport and in dampening muscle excitability. Other CLC proteins localize mainly to the endosomal-lysosomal system where they may facilitate luminal acidification or regulate luminal chloride concentration. All vesicular CLCs may be Cl(-)/H(+)-exchangers, as shown for the endosomal ClC-4 and -5 proteins. Human diseases and knockout mouse models have yielded important insights into their physiology and pathology. Phenotypes and diseases include myotonia, renal salt wasting, kidney stones, deafness, blindness, male infertility, leukodystrophy, osteopetrosis, lysosomal storage disease and defective endocytosis, demonstrating the broad physiological role of CLC-mediated anion transport.
KCNJ11 mutations are a common cause of diabetes diagnosed in the first 6 months of life, and approximately 25% of patients have neurological features. Sulphonylureas have been shown to improve glycaemic control and also motor function, but the impact on cognitive function has not been extensively addressed previously.
ABCC11 (Multidrug resistance protein 8; MRP8), a plasma membrane ATP-binding cassette transporter, has been implicated in drug resistance of breast cancer by virtue of its ability to confer resistance to fluoropyrimidines and to efflux methotrexate, and by its expression in this tumor. Expression of ABCC11 in breast, a hormonally regulated tissue, as well as the pump's ability to transport estrogen conjugates, suggest the possibility that expression of ABCC11 may be susceptible to regulation by estrogen. However, nothing is currently known about regulation of this gene. In this study, estradiol (E(2)) treatment reduced expression of ABCC11 mRNA in estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha-positive MCF7 cells, and E(2) antagonists such as ICI 182 780 and tamoxifen (TAM) abrogated E(2)-mediated downregulation. ABCC11 expression was positively correlated with ER-alpha expression in both breast cell lines, and two independent series of tumors from postmenopausal patients. In addition, expression of ABCC11 was upregulated in MCF7 cells exposed to TAM for 72 h, and was overexpressed in TAM-resistant cell lines. Drug sensitivity analysis of the TAM-resistant cells indicated that they were also resistant to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), consistent with the reported ability of ABCC11 to confer resistance to this agent. These studies indicate that ABCC11 expression is negatively regulated by E(2), but that ABCC11 expression is high in high-expressing ER-alpha breast cancers. Our findings support the notion that expression of ABCC11 in ER-alpha-positive breast cancers may contribute to decreased sensitivity to chemotherapy combinations that include 5-FU. ABCC11 may be a potential predictive tool in the choice of anticancer therapies in ER-positive breast cancers resistant to TAM.
CD38 and ZAP-70 are both useful prognostic markers for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but are variably discordant with IGHV mutation status. A total of 5 human Fc receptor-like molecules (FCRL1-5) have tyrosine-based immunoregulatory potential and are expressed by B-lineage subpopulations. To determine their prognostic potential in CLL, FCRL expression was compared with IGHV mutation status, CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, and clinical features from 107 patients. FCRL1, FCRL2, FCRL3, and FCRL5 were found at markedly higher levels on CLL cells bearing mutated IGHV genes than on unmutated CLL cells or CD19(+) polyclonal B lymphocytes. Univariate comparisons found that similar to CD38 and ZAP-70, FCRL expression was strongly associated with IGHV mutation status; however, only FCRL2 maintained independent predictive value by multivariate logistic analysis. Strikingly, FCRL2 demonstrated 94.4% concordance with IGHV mutation compared with 76.6% for CD38 and 80.4% for ZAP-70. Compared with other indicators, FCRL2 was also superior at predicting the time to first therapy; the median treatment-free interval was 15.5 years for patients with high FCRL2 expression compared with 3.75 years for FCRL2-low patients. Our studies indicate that FCRL2 has robust predictive value for determining IGHV gene mutation status and clinical progression and thus may further improve prognostic definition in CLL.
CYP2C9 is a polymorphic enzyme that has been reported to metabolize several clinically useful drugs such as warfarin, phenytoin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We designed a rapid single-tube multiplex assay to detect four variant alleles of the CYP2C9 in a single polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a single pyrosequencing reaction.
UGT1A6 has been proposed as the predominant isoform responsible for the glucuronidation of deferiprone. UGT1A6*2 allele has been associated with the altered enzyme activity.
AKR1B10 is an aldose reductase (AR) homologue overexpressed in liver cancer and various forms of that enzyme in carcinomas catalyze the reduction of anticancer drugs, potential cytostatic drug, and dl-glyceraldehyde but do not catalyze the reduction of glucose. Kinetic parameters for wild-type and C299S mutant AKR1B10 indicate that substitution of serine for cysteine at position 299 reduces the affinity of this protein for dl-glyceraldehyde and enhances its catalytic activity. Fibrates suppress peroxisome proliferation and the development of liver cancer in human. Here we report the potency of fibrate-mediated inhibition of the carbonyl reduction catalyzed by wild-type and C299S mutant AKR1B10 and compare it with known AR inhibitors. Wild-type AKR1B10-catalyzed carbonyl reduction follows pure non-competitive inhibition kinetics using zopolrestat, EBPC or sorbinil, whereas fenofibrate, Wy 14,643, ciprofibrate and fenofibric acid follow mixed non-competitive inhibition kinetics. In contrast, catalysis of reaction by the C299S AKR1B10 mutant is not inhibited by sorbinil and EBPC. Despite these differences, the C299S AKR1B10 mutant still manifests kinetics similar to the wild-type protein with other fibrates including zopolrestat, fenofibrate, Wy 14,346, gemfibrozil and ciprofibrate that show mixed non-competitive inhibition kinetics. The reaction of the mutant AKR1B10 is inhibited by fenofibric acid, but manifests pure non-competitive inhibition kinetics that are different from those demonstrated for the wild-type enzyme.
RDH11 and RDH12 are closely related retinol dehydrogenases expressed in the retina. RDH12 has been linked to the early-onset retinal dystrophy Leber congenital amaurosis, whereas RDH11 has not been associated with human disease. To understand their physiological roles, the authors investigated their expression during development and their regulation by light-induced oxidative stress in mouse retina.
PTEN mutations have been implicated in the development of endometrial hyperplasia and subsequent cancer. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists have demonstrated antineoplastic and chemopreventive effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone on both PTEN wild type and PTEN null cell lines and in the PTEN heterozygote((+/-)) murine model. Hec-1-A (PTEN wild type) and Ishikawa (PTEN null) cells were treated with rosiglitazone. Thirty-five female PTEN(+/-) mice were genotyped and placed into one of four groups for treatment for 18 weeks: A) PTEN wild type with 4 mg/kg rosiglitazone, B) PTEN(+/-) mice with vehicle, C) PTEN(+/-) mice with 4 mg/kg rosiglitazone, and D) PTEN(+/-) mice with 8 mg/kg rosiglitazone. Proliferation and apoptosis were measured by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling of DNA fragmentation sites assay. Rosiglitazone caused cell growth inhibition in both Hec-1-A and Ishikawa in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.02 and P < 0.03, respectively). Rosiglitazone also induced apoptosis in both Hec-1-A (P < .001) and Ishikawa (P < .001) cells in a dose-dependent manner. In the murine model, rosiglitazone decreased proliferation of the endometrial hyperplastic lesions (B vs C; 39.7% vs 9.3% and B vs D; 39.7% vs 4.2%; P < 0.0001) and increased apoptosis of glandular endometrial epithelial cells (B vs C; 2.8% vs 22.4%; P < 0.0001 and B vs D; 2.8% vs 30.2%; P = 0.003). PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in both PTEN intact and PTEN null cancer cell lines and in hyperplastic endometrial lesions in the PTEN(+/)(-)murine model.
TYRP1 (tyrosinase-related protein 1) is a melanoma antigen expressed in melanosomes and on the surface of melanoma cells. Previous studies have shown that mouse antibodies to TYRP1 localized to melanomas in vivo and inhibited tumor growth and metastasis. Here, we describe the characterization of a novel fully human anti-TYRP1 MAb (20D7) generated by immunizing HuMAb mice (Medarex). 20D7 recognized recombinant and native human TYRP1 by Western blotting and ELISA, and native TYRP1 in melanoma cells as determined by flow cytometry analysis. 20D7 cross-reacted with mouse TYRP1. The binding affinity to human TYRP1 for the human MAb was in the low nM range as determined by surface plasmon resonance kinetics. 20D7 can bind to human and mouse Fc receptor and induce a strong ADCC response against human melanoma cells in vitro. The antitumor activity of 20D7 was tested in human melanoma xenografts and mouse metastatic melanoma models in athymic nude mice. Growth of s.c. human melanoma tumors and metastatic nodules of murine B16 tumor were significantly suppressed by 20D7 compared to human IgG control. These results suggest that human anti-TYRP1 MAb may be a potent therapeutic for the treatment of malignant melanoma.
PIK3CA upregulation, amplification and mutation have been widely reported in ovarian cancers and other tumors, which strongly suggests that PIK3CA is a promising therapeutic target. However, to date the mechanisms underlying PIK3CA regulation and activation in vivo is still unclear. During tumorigenesis, host-tumor interactions may play a critical role in editing the tumor. Here, we report a novel mechanism through which the tumor microenvironment activates the PIK3CA oncogene. We show that PIK3CA upregulation occurs in non-proliferating tumor regions in vivo. We identified and characterized the PIK3CA 5' upstream transcriptional regulatory region and confirmed that PIK3CA is transcriptionally regulated through NF-kappaB pathway. These results offer a new mechanism through which the tumor microenvironment directly activates oncogenic pathways in tumor cells.
CD38 is expressed in human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells, regulates intracellular calcium, and its expression is augmented by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). CD38 has a role in airway hyperresponsiveness, a hallmark of asthma, since deficient mice develop attenuated airway hyperresponsiveness compared to wild-type mice following intranasal challenges with cytokines such as IL-13 and TNF-alpha. Regulation of CD38 expression in HASM cells involves the transcription factor NF-kappaB, and glucocorticoids inhibit this expression through NF-kappaB-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In this study, we determined whether the transcriptional regulation of CD38 expression in HASM cells involves response elements within the promoter region of this gene.
PTEN is a well-characterized tumor suppressor that negatively regulates cell growth and survival through the modulation of PI3K/Akt pathway.
ABCC4 encodes multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4), a member of the ATP-binding cassette family of membrane transporters involved in the efflux of endogenous and xenobiotic molecules. The aims of this study were to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms of ABCC4 and to functionally characterize selected nonsynonymous variants. Resequencing was performed in a large ethnically diverse population. Ten nonsynonymous variants were selected for analysis of transport function based on allele frequencies and evolutionary conservation. The reference and variant MRP4 cDNAs were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293T). The function of MRP4 variants was compared by measuring the intracellular accumulation of two antiviral agents, azidothymidine (AZT) and adefovir (PMEA). A total of 98 variants were identified in the coding and flanking intronic regions of ABCC4. Of these, 43 variants are in the coding region, and 22 are nonsynonymous. In a functional screen of ten variants, there was no evidence for a complete loss of function allele. However, two variants (G187W and G487E) showed a significantly reduced function compared to reference with both substrates, as evidenced by higher intracellular accumulation of AZT and PMEA compared to the reference MRP4 (43 and 69% increase in accumulation for G187W compared with the reference MRP4, with AZT and PMEA, respectively). The G187W variant also showed decreased expression following transient transfection of HEK 293T cells. Further studies are required to assess the clinical significance of this altered function and expression and to evaluate substrate specificity of this functional change.
CS gas (o-chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile) is one of the most commonly used riot agents. It can create excessive tearing, conjunctivitis, uncontrolled blinking (blepharospasm) and a sensation of burning and pain at initial exposure. Pulmonary edema (ARDS) and/or diffuse airway lesions on human would be lethal after CS inhalation. We report a case with acute laryngeal and bronchial obstruction due to vocal cord edema and extensive crusting at glottic level, trachea and bronchi. The CS gas was sprayed in a 6 x 6 m(2) closed room, and she was exposed to increased concentration of the gas for 10 s. Surprisingly, her initial symptoms were raised 21 days after CS spray exposure.
CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is an epithelial Cl- channel inhibited with high affinity and selectivity by the thiazolidinone compound CFTR(inh)-172. In the present study, we provide evidence that CFTR(inh)-172 acts directly on the CFTR. We introduced mutations in amino acid residues of the sixth transmembrane helix of the CFTR protein, a domain that has an important role in the formation of the channel pore. Basic and hydrophilic amino acids at positions 334-352 were replaced with alanine residues and the sensitivity to CFTR(inh)-172 was assessed using functional assays. We found that an arginine-to-alanine change at position 347 reduced the inhibitory potency of CFTR(inh)-172 by 20-30-fold. Mutagenesis of Arg347 to other amino acids also decreased the inhibitory potency, with aspartate producing near total loss of CFTR(inh)-172 activity. The results of the present study provide evidence that CFTR(inh)-172 interacts directly with CFTR, and that Arg347 is important for the interaction.
LPL activity plays an important role in preceding the VLDL remnant clearance via the three major apolipoprotein E (apoE)-recognizing receptors: the LDL receptor (LDLr), LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), and VLDL receptor (VLDLr). The aim of this study was to determine whether LPL activity is also important for VLDL remnant clearance irrespective of these receptors and to determine the mechanisms involved in the hepatic remnant uptake. Administration of an adenovirus expressing LPL (AdLPL) into lrp(-)ldlr(-/-)vldlr(-/-) mice reduced both VLDL-triglyceride (TG) and VLDL-total cholesterol (TC) levels. Conversely, inhibition of LPL by AdAPOC1 increased plasma VLDL-TG and VLDL-TC levels. Metabolic studies with radiolabeled VLDL-like emulsion particles showed that the clearance and hepatic association of their remnants positively correlated with LPL activity. This hepatic association was independent of the bridging function of LPL and HL, since heparin did not reduce the liver association. In vitro studies demonstrated that VLDL-like emulsion particles avidly bound to the cell surface of primary hepatocytes from lrp(-)ldlr(-/-)vldlr(-/-) mice, followed by slow internalization, and involved heparin-releaseable cell surface proteins as well as scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). Collectively, we conclude that hepatic VLDL remnant uptake in the absence of the three classical apoE-recognizing receptors is regulated by LPL activity and involves heparan sulfate proteoglycans and SR-BI.
ABCG2 was discovered in multi-drug-resistant cancer cells, with the identification of chemotherapeutic agents, such as mitoxantrone, flavopiridol, methotrexate and irinotecan as substrates. Later, drugs from other therapeutic groups were also described as substrates, including antibiotics, antivirals, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and flavonoids. An expanding list of compounds inhibiting ABCG2 has also been generated. The wide variety of drugs transported by ABCG2 and its normal tissue distribution with highest levels in the placenta, intestine and liver, suggest a role in protection against xenobiotics. ABCG2 also has an important role in the pharmacokinetics of its substrates. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the gene were shown to alter either plasma concentrations of substrate drugs or levels of resistance against chemotherapeutic agents in cell lines. ABCG2 was also described as the determinant of the side population of stem cells. All these aspects of the transporter warrant further research aimed at understanding ABCG2's structure, function and regulation of expression.
SMS [SM (sphingomyelin) synthase] is a class of enzymes that produces SM by transferring a phosphocholine moiety on to ceramide. PC (phosphatidylcholine) is believed to be the phosphocholine donor of the reaction with consequent production of DAG (diacylglycerol), an important bioactive lipid. In the present study, by modulating SMS1 and SMS2 expression, the role of these enzymes on the elusive regulation of DAG was investigated. Because we found that modulation of SMS1 or SMS2 did not affect total levels of endogenous DAG in resting cells, whereas they produce DAG in vitro, the possibility that SMSs could modulate subcellular pools of DAG, once acute activation of the enzymes is triggered, was investigated. Stimulation of SM synthesis was induced by either treatment with short-chain ceramide analogues or by increasing endogenous ceramide at the plasma membrane, and a fluorescently labelled conventional C1 domain [from PKC (protein kinase C)] enhanced in its DAG binding activity was used to probe subcellular pools of DAG in the cell. With this approach, we found, using confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation, that modulation of SMS1 and, to a lesser extent, SMS2 affected the formation of DAG at the Golgi apparatus. Similarly, down-regulation of SMS1 and SMS2 reduced the localization of the DAG-binding protein PKD (protein kinase D) to the Golgi. These results provide direct evidence that both enzymes are capable of regulating the formation of DAG in cells, that this pool of DAG is biologically active, and for the first time directly implicate SMS1 and SMS2 as regulators of DAG-binding proteins in the Golgi apparatus.
UGT1A10 was recently identified as the major isoform that conjugates estrogens. In this study, real-time PCR revealed high levels of UGT1A10 and UGT2B7 mRNA in human breast tissues. The expression of UGT1A10 in breast was a novel finding. UGT1A10 and UGT2B7 mRNAs were differentially expressed among normal and malignant specimens. Their overall expression was significantly decreased in breast carcinomas as compared to normal breast specimens (UGT1A10: 68+/-26 vs. 252+/-86, respectively; p<0.05) and (UGT2B7: 1.4+/-0.7 vs. 12+/-4, respectively; p<0.05). Interestingly, in African American women, UGT1A10 expression was significantly decreased in breast carcinomas in comparison to normals (57+/-35 vs. 397+/-152, respectively; p<0.05). Among Caucasian women, UGT2B7 was significantly decreased in breast carcinomas in comparison to normals (1.1+/-0.5 vs. 13.5+/-6, respectively; p<0.05). Glucuronidation of 4-hydroxylated estrone (4-OHE(1)) was significantly reduced in breast carcinomas compared to normals (30+/-15 vs. 106+/-31, respectively; p<0.05). Differential down-regulation of UGT1A10 and UGT2B7 mRNAs, protein, and activity in breast carcinomas compared to the adjacent normal breast specimens from the same donor were also found. These data illustrate the novel finding of UGT1A10 in human breast and confirm the expression of UGT2B7. Significant individual variation and down-regulation of expression in breast carcinomas of both isoforms were also demonstrated. These findings provide evidence that decreased UGT expression and activity could result in the promotion of carcinogenesis.
CYP4A11 arachidonic acid monooxygenase oxidizes endogenous arachidonic acid to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a renal vasoconstrictor and natriuretic. Cyp4a deficiency causes hypertension in male mice, and a loss-of-function variant (T8590C) of CYP4A11 is associated with hypertension in white individuals. Hypertension and hypertensive renal disease are more common among black than white individuals, but the relationship between genetic variation at CYP4A11 and hypertension in black individuals is not known. This study tested the hypothesis that the CYP4A11 T8590C polymorphism is associated with higher BP or clinical outcomes in 732 black Americans with hypertensive renal disease participating in the African American Study of Kidney Disease (AASK). Men with the 8590CC genotype had significantly higher systolic BP (CC 156.5 +/- 22.6 versus 148.4 +/- 24.3 mmHg in CT and TT combined; P = 0.04) and pulse pressure (P = 0.04) at baseline; this association was not observed among women. In addition, this genotype was associated with higher systolic and diastolic BP at 36-mo follow-up among those randomly assigned to the lower BP arm of the AASK. Among all participants (or men but not women) with proteinuria, the 8590CC genotype was associated with an increased cumulative incidence of ESRD or death, controlling for randomization and clinical characteristics. In summary, the CYP4A11 8590CC genotype is associated with increased BP in black men with hypertensive nephrosclerosis and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in those with baseline proteinuria. These data support a role for renal monooxygenases and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in the regulation of BP and renal function in men.
CYP1A2 plays a key role in the metabolism of both estrogen and coffee. Women with higher coffee intake and the CYP1A2*1F A/A genotype have a ratio of high 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1) to 16alpha-OHE1. 2-OHE1 is a weak estrogen and may even block the estrogen receptor (ER), whereas 16alpha-OHE1 is procarcinogenic. We hypothesized that moderate to high coffee consumption (> or =2 cups per day) combined with the CYP1A2*1F A/A genotype would be associated with a later age at diagnosis and a greater proportion of ER-negative (ER-) tumors among patients with breast cancer. We genotyped 458 patients with breast cancer (age, 25-99 years) in Lund, Sweden, for CYP1A2*1F. Information on lifestyle factors and tumor characteristics were obtained from preoperative questionnaires and pathology reports. Among patients with CYP1A2*1F A/A (51.3%), moderate to high consumption was associated with a later age at diagnosis compared with low coffee consumption (59.8 versus 52.6 years, P = 0.0004). These patients were also more likely to have ER- tumors than patients with low consumption (14.7% versus 0%, P = 0.018). Coffee was not associated with ER status or age at diagnosis in patients with at least one C allele. Age at diagnosis was not associated with ER status in patients with CYP1A2*1F A/A, but younger patients (<50 years) with at least one C allele were more likely to have ER- tumors compared with older patients (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-9.3; P = 0.0002). These findings raise the hypothesis that coffee slows the growth of ER-positive tumors in patients with CYP1A2*1F A/A and may have implications for breast cancer if confirmed.
ABCG5 (G5) and ABCG8 (G8) are ATP-binding cassette half-transporters that limit intestinal uptake and promote biliary secretion of neutral sterols. Here, we describe the purification of endogenous G5G8 from mouse liver to near homogeneity. We incorporated the native proteins into membrane vesicles and reconstituted sterol transfer. Native gel electrophoresis, density-gradient ultracentrifugation, and chemical cross-linking studies indicated that the functional native complex is a heterodimer. No higher order oligomeric forms were observed at any stage in the catalytic cycle. Sterol transfer activity by purified native G5G8 was stable, stereospecific, and selective. We also report that G5 but not G8 is S-palmitoylated and that palmitoylation is not essential for dimerization, trafficking, or biliary sterol secretion. Both G5 and G8 have short but highly conserved cytoplasmic tails. The functional roles of these C-terminal regions were examined using an in vivo functional assay.
CD38 is an ectoenzyme involved in transmembrane signaling and cell adhesion and is used as a disease marker for leukemias and myeloma. CD38 is a dependable negative prognostic marker for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Recent evidence indicates that CD38 is a component of a complex network delivering growth and survival signals to CLL cells. In conjunction with chemokines and their receptors, CD38 also influences cell migratory responses. These considerations are the rationale for devising a CLL therapy that uses CD38 as the target. The use of reagents specifically blocking the molecule might provide a new approach for interfering with deleterious growth circuits, therefore increasing the susceptibility of leukemic cells to conventional chemotherapy.
COMT gene is a logical candidate gene for schizophrenia. Moreover, variations in the COMT Val158Met functional polymorphism have been associated with prefrontal cognitive abnormalities among patients with schizophrenia, healthy relatives and controls. In this study, using an epidemiologically-based sample of 130 patients experiencing a first-episode of a non-affective psychosis, we examined whether COMT Val158Met genotype influenced cognitive performance on the phenotypic expression of psychosis. We found no significant differences in any cognitive measure according to COMT genotype. These findings, together with previously published research, put the relationship between COMT genotype and cognitive performance in doubt.
AKR1D1 (steroid 5beta-reductase) reduces all Delta(4)-3-ketosteroids to form 5beta-dihydrosteroids, a first step in the clearance of steroid hormones and an essential step in the synthesis of all bile acids. The reduction of the carbon-carbon double bond in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone by 5beta-reductase is a unique reaction in steroid enzymology because hydride transfer from NADPH to the beta-face of a Delta(4)-3-ketosteroid yields a cis-A/B-ring configuration with an approximately 90 degrees bend in steroid structure. Here, we report the first x-ray crystal structure of a mammalian steroid hormone carbon-carbon double bond reductase, human Delta(4)-3-ketosteroid 5beta-reductase (AKR1D1), and its complexes with intact substrates. We have determined the structures of AKR1D1 complexes with NADP(+) at 1.79- and 1.35-A resolution (HEPES bound in the active site), NADP(+) and cortisone at 1.90-A resolution, NADP(+) and progesterone at 2.03-A resolution, and NADP(+) and testosterone at 1.62-A resolution. Complexes with cortisone and progesterone reveal productive substrate binding orientations based on the proximity of each steroid carbon-carbon double bond to the re-face of the nicotinamide ring of NADP(+). This orientation would permit 4-pro-(R)-hydride transfer from NADPH. Each steroid carbonyl accepts hydrogen bonds from catalytic residues Tyr(58) and Glu(120). The Y58F and E120A mutants are devoid of activity, supporting a role for this dyad in the catalytic mechanism. Intriguingly, testosterone binds nonproductively, thereby rationalizing the substrate inhibition observed with this particular steroid. The locations of disease-linked mutations thought to be responsible for bile acid deficiency are also revealed.
CYP1A1 is a gene involved in the high aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase -inducible phenotype, which is a genetically-determined variation among individuals that has been associated with lung cancer risk. More specifically, CYP1A1 *2B and *4 polymorphisms have been associated with high susceptibility to lung cancer among cigarette smokers.
CFTR is a member of the ABC (ATP binding cassette) superfamily of transporters. It is a multidomain membrane protein, which utilizes ATP to regulate the flux of its substrate through the membrane. CFTR is distinct in that it functions as a channel and it possesses a unique regulatory R domain. There has been significant progress in understanding the molecular basis for CFTR activity as an ATPase. The dimeric complex of NBD structures seen in prokaryotic ABC transporters, together with the structure of an isolated CF-NBD1, provide a unifying molecular template to model the structural basis for the ATPase activity of CFTR. The dynamic nature of the interaction between the NBDs and the R domain has been revealed in NMR studies. On the other hand, understanding the mechanisms mediating the transmission of information from the cytosolic domains to the membrane and the channel gate of CFTR remains a central challenge.
STRA6 is a multitransmembrane domain protein not homologous to any other proteins with known function. It functions as the high-affinity receptor for plasma retinol binding protein (RBP) and mediates cellular uptake of vitamin A from the vitamin A-RBP complex. Consistent with the diverse roles of vitamin A and the wide tissue expression pattern of STRA6, mutations in STRA6 are associated with severe pathological phenotypes in humans. The structural basis for STRA6's biochemical function is unknown. Although computer programs predict 11 transmembrane domains for STRA6, its topology has never been studied experimentally. Elucidating the transmembrane topology of STRA6 is critical for understanding its structure and function. By inserting an epitope tag into all possible extracellular and intracellular domains of STRA6, we systematically analyzed the accessibility of each tag on the surface of live cells, the accessibility of each tag in permeabilized cells, and the effect of each tag on RBP binding and STRA6-mediated vitamin A uptake from the vitamin A-RBP complex. In addition, we used a new lysine accessibility technique combining cell-surface biotinylation and tandem-affinity purification to study a region of the protein not revealed by the epitope tagging method. These studies not only revealed STRA6's extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains but also implicated extracellular regions of STRA6 in RBP binding.
PDE4D was identified as the first novel gene associated with ischemic stroke risk. Replication studies have produced conflicting results, but many have been small and underpowered. Meta-analysis provides a method to combine this data and determine in a larger sample size whether the association with PDE4D can be replicated.
SDS and Triton X-100 added at their critical micelle concentrations (CMCs), increased phenanthrene solubility in the presence of sediments and inhibited phenanthrene biodegradation. Triton X-100 caused more inhibition than SDS. 16S rDNA analyses revealed that both surfactants changed the microbial communities of phenanthrene-degrading cultures. Further, after the surfactant additions, parts of the microbial populations were not detected and methane production decreased. Surfactant applications, necessary to achieve actual CMCs, alter microbial community structure and diminish methanogenic activity under anaerobic conditions. We propose that this change may be related to the inhibitory effects of SDS and Triton X-100 on phenanthrene biodegradation under methanogenic conditions.
CD38 rules proliferation signals in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, suggesting that the molecule is not merely a prognostic marker but also a key element in the pathogenetic network underlying the disease. CD38 has a genetic polymorphism, characterized by a C>G variation in the regulatory region of intron 1. The working hypothesis is that the presence of different alleles in CLL patients marks (or accounts for) some of the clinical heterogeneity. CD38 allele distribution in 248 Italian patients overlapped with that of the controls (n = 232), suggesting that susceptibility to CLL is not influenced by CD38 genotype. Stratification of patients according to markers of unfavorable prognosis constantly resulted in a significantly higher frequency of the rare G allele. Furthermore, analysis of clinical parameters showed that G allele is independently associated with nodal/splenic involvement. The highest G allele frequency was observed in the 16 patients of the cohort that developed Richter syndrome (RS). Five-year cumulative incidence of transformation was significantly higher in G allele carriers than in CC homozygotes. Multivariate analysis on a total of 30 RS patients confirmed that the probability of transformation is strongly associated with G allele, likely representing an independent risk factor for RS development.
ABCG2 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. Its overexpression causes multidrug resistance in cancer chemotherapy. Based on its apparent half size in sequence when compared with other traditional ABC transporters, ABCG2 has been thought to exist and function as a homodimer linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds. However, recent evidence suggests that ABCG2 may exist as a higher form of oligomers due to noncovalent interactions. In this study, we attempted to create a cysless mutant ABCG2 as a tool for further characterization of this molecule. However, we found that the cysless mutant ABCG2 is well expressed but not functional. Mapping of the cysteine residues showed that three cysteine residues (Cys284, Cys374, and Cys438) are required concurrently for the function of ABCG2 and potentially for intramolecular disulfide bond formation. We also found that the cysteine residues (Cys592, Cys603, and Cys608) in the third extracellular loop are involved in forming intermolecular disulfide bonds and that mutation of these residues does not affect the expression or drug transport activity of human ABCG2. Thus, we conclude that Cys284, Cys374, and Cys438, which may be involved in intramolecular disulfide bond formation, are concurrently required for ABCG2 function, whereas Cys592, Cys603, and Cys608, potentially involved in intermolecular disulfide bond formation, are not required.
CD36 is a scavenger receptor that binds multiple ligands, including phosphatidyl serine (PS). Although CD36(-) mice do not have a bleeding diathesis, we show here that they do have significantly prolonged thrombotic occlusion times in response to FeCl(3)-induced vascular injury. Because cell-derived microparticles (MPs) are generated in response to vascular injury and circulate in patients with prothrombotic diseases, we hypothesized that PS exposed on their surfaces could be an endogenous CD36 ligand that transmits an activating signal to platelets. We found that MPs prepared from human ECs, monocytes, or platelets or isolated from blood of normal subjects bound to platelets. Binding was not observed with platelets from CD36(-) donors and was inhibited by an anti-CD36 antibody or by blockade of exposed PS by annexin V or anti-PS IgM. Preincubation of platelets with MPs led to CD36-dependent augmentation of platelet activation in response to low doses of ADP, as assessed by measuring alpha(2b)beta(3) activation, P-selectin expression, and aggregation. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of murine carotid thrombi from CD36(-) mice showed a significant decrement in endothelial antigen accumulation, which suggests that CD36 plays a role in MP recruitment into thrombi. These results provide what we believe to be a novel role for CD36 in thrombosis.
PTEN is a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosome 10. Deficient PTEN expression leads to activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (pAkt) signaling pathway, which may contribute to multiple human cancers. The relation between PTEN expression and Akt activation is still unclear in colorectal cancers and adenomatous polyps. Moreover, PTEN and pAkt expression in relation to demographic, tumoral, and outcome variables remains to be elucidated.
DPYD gene encodes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase which is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the metabolism of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The aim of our study was PCR-RFLP based-genetic testing for the most common 5-FU toxicity-attributable IVS14 + 1G > A DPYD mutation (DPYD(*)2A) in 252 Polish colorectal cancer (CRC) patients treated with this adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimen after surgery. The DPYD(*)2A allele was identified only in one patient: a male who was one of 4 CRC patients suffering from grades 3-4 myelotoxicity upon 5-FU chemotherapy. We conclude that IVS14 + 1G > A DPYD (DPYD(*)2A) variant occurs in the Polish population and is responsible for a significant proportion of life-threatening toxicity of 5-FU.
CYP3A5 gene polymorphism has been shown to influence tacrolimus (TAC) blood concentration and dose requirement in adult kidney transplant patients. The aim was to analyze retrospectively the modification induced by CYP3A5 gene polymorphism on TAC's pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from 26 adolescents receiving TAC as their main immunosuppressive drug.
SLC5A8 and SLC5A12 are sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (SMCTs), the former being a high-affinity type and the latter a low-affinity type. Both transport a variety of monocarboxylates in a Na(+)-coupled manner. They are expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, thyroid, brain, and retina. SLC5A8 is localized to the apical membrane of epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract and proximal tubule. In the brain and retina, its expression is restricted to neurons and the retinal pigment epithelium. The physiologic functions of SLC5A8 include absorption of short-chain fatty acids in the colon and small intestine, reabsorption of lactate and pyruvate in the kidney, and cellular uptake of lactate and ketone bodies in neurons. It also transports the B-complex vitamin nicotinate. SLC5A12 is also localized to the apical membrane of epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract and proximal tubule. In the brain and retina, its expression is restricted to astrocytes and Müller cells. SLC5A8 also functions as a tumor suppressor; its expression is silenced in tumors of colon, thyroid, stomach, kidney, and brain. The tumor-suppressive function is related to its ability to mediate concentrative uptake of butyrate, propionate, and pyruvate, all of which are inhibitors of histone deacetylases. SLC5A8 can also transport a variety of pharmacologically relevant monocarboxylates, including salicylates, benzoate, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and fenoprofen, also interact with SLC5A8. These drugs are not transportable substrates for SLC5A8, but instead function as blockers of the transporter. Relatively less is known on the role of SLC5A12 in drug transport.
CYP1A2 is involved in the metabolism of several widely used drugs and endogenous compounds, and in the activation of procarcinogens. Both genetic and environmental factors influence the activity of this enzyme. The current knowledge regarding factors influencing the activity of CYP1A2 is summarized in this review. Substrates, inhibitors and inducers of CYP1A2 activity, as well as phenotyping probes, are discussed. The functional significance and clinical importance of CYP1A2 gene polymorphisms are reviewed and interethnic differences in the distribution of CYP1A2 variant alleles and haplotypes are summarized. Finally, future perspectives for the possible clinical applications of CYP1A2 genotyping are discussed.
ATP8B1 is a phosphatidylserine flippase in the canalicular membrane; patients with mutations in ATP8B1 develop severe chronic (PFIC1) or periodic (BRIC1) cholestatic liver disease. We have observed that Atp8b1 deficiency leads to enhanced biliary cholesterol excretion. It has been established that biliary cholesterol excretion depends on transport by the heterodimer Abcg5/Abcg8. We hypothesized that the increased cholesterol output was due to enhanced extraction from the altered canalicular membrane rather than to higher Abcg5/Abcg8 activity. We therefore studied the relation between Abcg5/Abcg8 expression and biliary cholesterol excretion in mice lacking Atp8b1, Abcg8, or both (GF mice).
ACE technique provides an effective tool for the separation and identification of disease-related biomarkers in clinical analysis. In recent years, a couple of synthetic DNA or RNA oligonucleotides, known as aptamers, rival the specificity and affinity for targets to antibodies and are employed as one kind of powerful affinity probe in ACE. In this work, based on high affinity between antithrombin aptamer and thrombin (their dissociation constant is 0.5 nM), a carboxyfluorescein-labeled 29-nucleotide (nt) aptamer (F29-mer) was used and an aptamer-based affinity probe CE (aptamer-based APCE) method was successfully established for high-sensitive detection and quantitative analysis of thrombin. Experimental conditions including incubation temperature and time, buffer composition, and concentration of cations were investigated and optimized. Under the optimized condition, the linear range was from 0 to 400 nM and the LOD was 2 nM (74 ng/mL, S/N = 3), i.e., 40 amol, both in running buffer and in 5% v/v human serum. This LOD is the lowest one than those achieved by the previous APCE methods but based on a 15-mer aptamer. This approach offers a promising method for the rapid, selective, and sensitive detection of thrombin in practical utility. Further binding experiments using one carboxyfluorescein-labeled aptamer and the other nonlabeled aptamer or vice versa were carried out to deduce the formation of ternary complex when these two aptamers coexisted in the free solution with thrombin.
CA9 is a membrane-tethered, carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzyme, expressed mainly at the external surface of cells, that catalyzes reversible CO(2) hydration. Expression is greatly enhanced in many tumors, particularly in aggressive carcinomas. The functional role of CA9 in tumors is not well established. Here we show that CA9, when expressed heterologously in cultured spheroids (0.5-mm diameter, ~25,000 cells) of RT112 cells (derived from bladder carcinoma), induces a near-uniform intracellular pH (pH(i)) throughout the structure. Dynamic pH(i) changes during displacements of superfusate CO(2) concentration are also spatially coincident (within 2 s). In contrast, spheroids of wild-type RT112 cells lacking CA9 exhibit an acidic core (~0.25 pH(i) reduction) and significant time delays (~9 s) for pH(i) changes in core versus peripheral regions. pH(i) non-uniformity also occurs in CA9-expressing spheroids after selective pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme. In isolated RT112 cells, pH(i) regulation is unaffected by CA9 expression. The influence of CA9 on pH(i) is thus only evident in multicellular tissue. Diffusion-reaction modeling indicates that CA9 coordinates pH(i) spatially by facilitating CO(2) diffusion in the unstirred extracellular space of the spheroid. We suggest that pH(i) coordination may favor survival and growth of a tumor. By disrupting spatial pH(i) control, inhibition of CA9 activity may offer a novel strategy for the clinical treatment of CA9-associated tumors.
CYP4A11 is an enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which is involved in regulation of vascular tone in the brain. Recent evidence indicates that the polymorphism of the CYP genes is associated with cerebral infarction (CI). The aim of the present study was to assess the association between the human CYP4A11 gene and CI using a haplotype-based case-control study divided by gender.
ABCA1 transport of cholesterol and phospholipids to nascent HDL particles plays a central role in lipoprotein metabolism and macrophage cholesterol homeostasis. ABCA1 activity is regulated both at the transcriptional level and at the post-translational level. To explore mechanisms involved in the post-translational regulation of the transporter, we have used affinity purification and mass spectrometry to identify proteins that bind ABCA1 and influence its activity. Previously, we demonstrated that an interaction between beta1-syntrophin stimulated ABCA1 activity, at least in part, be slowing the degradation of the transporter. This work demonstrates that one subunit of the serine palmitoyltransferase enzyme, SPTLC1, but not subunit 2 (SPTLC2), is copurified with ABCA1 and negatively regulates its function. In human THP-I macrophages and in mouse liver, the ABCA1-SPTLC1 complex was detected by co-immunoprecipitation, demonstrating that the interaction occurs in cellular settings where ABCA1 activity is critical for HDL genesis. Pharmacologic inhibition of SPTLC1 with myriocin, which resulted in the disruption of the SPTLC1-ABCA1 complex, and siRNA knockdown of SPTLC1 expression both stimulated ABCA1 efflux by nearly 60% ( p < 0.05). In contrast, dominant-negative mutants of SPTLC1 inhibited ABCA1 efflux, indicating that a reduced level of sphingomyelin synthesis could not explain the effect of myriocin on ABCA1 activity. In 293 cells, the SPTLC1 inhibition of ABCA1 activity led to the blockade of the exit of ABCA1 from the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, myriocin treatment of macrophages increased the level of cell surface ABCA1. In composite, these results indicate that the physical interaction of ABCA1 and SPTLC1 results in reduction of ABCA1 activity and that inhibition of this interaction produces enhanced cholesterol efflux.
CYP2C9 polymorphisms result in reduced enzyme catalytic activity and greater activation by effector molecules as compared to wild-type protein, with the mechanism(s) for these changes in activity not fully elucidated. Through T(1) NMR and spectral binding analyses, mechanism(s) for these differences in behavior of the variant proteins (CYP2C9.2, CYP2C9.3, and CYP2C9.5) as compared to CYP2C9.1 were assessed. Neither altered binding affinity nor substrate (flurbiprofen) proton to heme-iron distances differed substantially among the four enzymes. Co-incubation with dapsone resulted in reduced substrate proton to heme-iron distances for all enzymes, providing at least a partial mechanism for the activation of CYP2C9 variants by dapsone. In summary, neither altered binding affinity nor substrate orientation appear to be major factors in the reduced catalytic activity noted in the CYP2C9 variants, but dapsone co-incubation caused similar changes in substrate proton to heme-iron distances suggesting at least partial common mechanisms in the activation of the CYP2C9 forms.
CA3 lesions impair encoding, whereas CA1 lesions impair retrieval during learning of a Hebb-Williams maze. CA3 efferents in the fimbria were transected, taking care to spare cholinergic and GABAergic afferents. CA1 efferents in the dorsal fornix were similarly transected. Fimbria transections, but not dorsal fornix transections, resulted in deficits for the encoding of spatial information during learning of a Hebb-Williams maze. Dorsal fornix, but not fimbria, transections resulted in deficits for retrieval of spatial memory during learning of a Hebb-Williams maze. These results reveal a double dissociation for the roles of CA3 and CA1 subcortical efferents in encoding and retrieval processes that mirror the double dissociation seen after excitotoxic lesions of CA1 and CA3. These data provide support for the theory that the cholinergic projections from the septal nuclei modulate the dynamics for encoding and consolidation/retrieval in the hippocampus.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome10q23.3. In addition to genetic mutations and deletions, the down-regulation of PTEN has been found in various malignant tumors. However, little is known about the profile of PTEN gene in oral carcinomas. In this study, the expression profiles and genetic alterations of PTEN were examined in 113 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cases and 9 OSCC-derived cell lines. An immunohistochemical analysis showed statistically significant differences in the immunohistochemical (IHC) scores for PTEN protein in normal tissues and in cancerous regions (P=0.0104), suggesting that PTEN protein expression is down-regulated in OSCC. No significant correlations existed between the down-regulation of PTEN protein expression and the clinicopathological features of the tumor. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed a lower PTEN mRNA expression in the 9 OSCC-derived cell lines examined, as compared to the normal oral epithelium cells. However, treatment with a demethylating reagent restored PTEN mRNA expression in 4 cell lines. No genetic mutations were detected in these cell lines by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. The results suggest that epigenetic changes may be related to the down-regulation of PTEN expression. We therefore conclude that PTEN is a crucial molecule in the tumorigenesis of OSCC.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10), a potent tumour suppressor and multifunctional signalling protein, is under intricate regulation. In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism and regulation of PTEN ubiquitination catalysed by NEDD4-1 (neural-precursor-cell-expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4-1), a ubiquitin ligase for PTEN we identified recently. Using the reconstituted assay and cellular analysis, we demonstrated that NEDD4-1-mediated PTEN ubiquitination depends on its intact HECT (homologous to E6-associated protein C-terminus) domain. Instead of using its WW domains (protein-protein interaction domains containing two conserved tryptophan residues) as a protein interaction module, NEDD4-1 interacts with PTEN through its N-terminal region containing a C2 domain as well as the HECT domain. Strikingly, we found that a C-terminal truncated PTEN fragment binds to NEDD4-1 with higher affinity than the full-length PTEN, suggesting an intrinsic inhibitory effect of the PTEN C-terminus on PTEN-NEDD4-1 interaction. Moreover, the C-terminal truncated PTEN is more sensitive to NEDD4-1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore the present study reveals that the C-terminus of PTEN plays a critical role in stabilizing PTEN via antagonizing NEDD4-1-induced PTEN protein decay; conversely, truncation of the PTEN C-terminus results in rapid NEDD4-1-mediated PTEN degradation, a possible mechanism accounting for attenuation of PTEN function by certain PTEN mutations in human cancers.
MTHFR C677T polymorphism is a genetic factor increasing both risk factors for atherosclerotic vascular diseases and obstetric complications like preeclampsia (PE) and fetal growth restriction (FGR). Increased uterine artery impedance, measured by uterine artery Doppler in the second trimester of pregnancy is also associated with PE and FGR. In this study we aimed to analyze whether MTHFR influences first and second trimester uterine artery impedance.
CFTR mutation, which causes cystic fibrosis (CF), has also recently been identified as causing glutathione system dysfunction and systemic deficiency of reduced glutathione (GSH). Such dysfunction and deficiency regarding GSH may contribute to the pathophysiology of CF. We followed 13 patients (age range 1-27 years) with cystic fibrosis who were using a regimen of reduced glutathione (GSH), including oral glutathione and inhaled buffered glutathione in an uncontrolled, observational study. Dosage ranged from 66-148 mg/kg/day in divided doses, and the term examined was the initial 5.5 months of GSH use (45 days of incrementally adjusted dose, plus 4 months of use at full dosage). Baseline and post-measurements of FEV1 percent predicted, BMI percentile, and weight percentile were noted, in addition to bacterial status and pulmonary exacerbations. Significant improvement in the following clinical parameters was observed: average improvement in FEV1 percent predicted (N=10) was 5.8 percentage points (p<0.0001), average weight percentile (N=13) increased 8.6 points (p<0.001), BMI percentile (N=11) improved on average 1.22 points (p<0.001). All patients improved in FEV1 and BMI, if measured in their case; 12 of 13 patients improved in weight percentile. Positive sputum cultures of bacteria in 11 patients declined from 13 to 5 (p<0.03) with sputum cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa becoming negative in 4 of 5 patients previously culturing PA, including two of three patients chronically infected with PA as determined by antibody status. Use of a daily GSH regimen appears to be associated in CF patients with significant improvement in lung function and weight, and a significant decline in bacteria cultured in this uncontrolled study. These findings bear further clinical investigation in larger, randomized, controlled studies.
PTEN seems to play an important role in cell cycle, growth, migration, and death. Integrins are cell surface receptors that play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, implantation, and embryogenesis. PTEN inhibits beta1 integrin signaling. The objective of this study is to investigate the expression of PTEN and beta1 integrin in placental tissues of early spontaneous abortion and first and third trimesters of normal pregnancy.
NQO1 guards against oxidative stress and carcinogenesis and stabilizes p53. We find that a homozygous common missense variant (NQO1(*)2, rs1800566(T), NM_000903.2:c.558C>T) that disables NQO1 strongly predicts poor survival among two independent series of women with breast cancer (P = 0.002, N = 1,005; P = 0.005, N = 1,162), an effect particularly evident after anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin (P = 7.52 x 10(-6)) and in p53-aberrant tumors (P = 6.15 x 10(-5)). Survival after metastasis was reduced among NQO1(*)2 homozygotes, further implicating NQO1 deficiency in cancer progression and treatment resistance. Consistently, response to epirubicin was impaired in NQO1(*)2-homozygous breast carcinoma cells in vitro, reflecting both p53-linked and p53-independent roles of NQO1. We propose a model of defective anthracycline response in NQO1-deficient breast tumors, along with increased genomic instability promoted by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), and suggest that the NQO1 genotype is a prognostic and predictive marker for breast cancer.
SLC6A8 deficiency is caused by mutations in the X-linked creatine transporter gene (SLC6A8), which leads to cerebral creatine deficiency, mental retardation, speech and language delay, autistic-like behaviour and epilepsy. Insight in the mechanism of how the transporter is regulated is largely unknown and it is of importance for the development of successful treatment strategies of cerebral creatine deficient syndromes. Our goal was to characterize CRT2 (SLC6A8B), a published splice variant of the creatine transporter. Surprisingly, using RT-PCR we found a novel splice variant, SLC6A8C, which is predominantly found in human tissues with a high energy requirement such as brain, kidney, heart, small intestines and skeletal muscle, where SLC6A8 transporter is most required. The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the SLC6A8C mRNA was identified using the Smart Race cDNA amplification kit. The SLC6A8C mRNA contains intron 4 and exons 5 through 13 of SLC6A8, including part of the 3' UTR. An open reading frame was found, which predicts a truncated protein identical to the SLC6A8 transporter, comprising the five last C-terminal transmembrane domains of the SLC6A8 transporter. SLC6A8C open reading frame was cloned as a fusion protein with EGFP and the SLC6A8C protein expression was detected by Western Blot. RT-PCR and sequence analysis showed that this splice variant is conserved in evolution, since we also detected it in mouse. This study reveals the presence of a novel SLC6A8 splice variant, SLC6A8C in human and mouse.
CD38 appears to be a promising candidate in antibody therapy; it is upregulated on cell surfaces in many lymphoid tumors and undergoes rapid internalization after interaction with antibodies. The receptor-mediated endocytosis allows conjugating toxins/drugs that promote suicide only of the malignant cells. Here, we describe the preparation of CD38-immunoliposomes and test their functionality by incubating them with CD38+/- cells. Liposomes were prepared by extrusion of a lipid mixture containing a biotinylated polyethylene glycol-phospholipid and loaded with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. The anti-CD38 antibody (IB4) was biotinylated and then linked to streptavidin molecules; streptavidin acts like a bridge between the antibody and the biotinylated lipid of the liposomes. CD38+/- cells were incubated either with liposomes or immunoliposomes and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and cytofluorimetry. The results indicated a specific mechanism of internalization, owing to CD38-mediated endocytosis, where CD38+ cells incubated with immunoliposomes scored top fluorescence levels. This coupling strategy, based on the use of a streptavidin bridge to prepare immunoliposomes, does not interfere with the cellular functionality and its broad potential use represents a great advantage. Here IB4, a murine monoclonal anti-CD38 antibody, was used to simplify the experiments, but the coupling procedure may be suitable also with human antibodies, against CD38 or other human markers.
CYP2B6 has not been as fully characterized at the molecular level as other members of the human cytochrome P450 family. As more widely used in vitro probes for characterizing the involvement of this enzyme in the metabolism of xenobiotics have become available, the number of molecules identified as CYP2B6 substrates has increased. In this study we have analyzed the available kinetic data generated by multiple laboratories with human recombinant expressed CYP2B6 and along with calculated molecular properties derived from the ChemSpider database, we have determined the molecular features that appear to be important for CYP2B6 substrates. In addition we have applied 2D and 3D QSAR methods to generate predictive pharmacophore and 2D models. For 28 molecules with K(m) data, the molecular weight (mean +/- SD) is 253.78+/-74.03, ACD/logP is 2.68+/-1.51, LogD(pH 5.5) is 1.51+/-1.43, LogD(pH 7.4) is 2.02+/-1.25, hydrogen bond donor (HBD) count is 0.57 +/-0.57, hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) count is 2.57+/-1.37, rotatable bonds is 3.50+/-2.71 and total polar surface area (TPSA) is 27.63+/-19.42. A second set of 15 molecules without K(m) data possessed similar mean molecular property values. These properties are comparable to those of a set of 21 molecules used in a previous pharmacophore modeling study (Ekins et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther 288 (1), 21-29, 1999). Only the LogD and HBD values were statistically significantly different between these different datasets. We have shown that CYP2B6 substrates are generally small hydrophobic molecules that are frequently central nervous system active, which may be important for drug discovery research.
CYP1A2 is an important cytochrome P450 enzymes, which is involved in metabolism of many clinical drugs and activation of some precarcinogens. CYP1A2 activity can be influenced by various factors including genetic polymorphism, drugs, food and so on, in which the CYP1A2 genetic polymorphism is the basis of difference on the activity and induction of CYP1A2. Therefore,the genotyping of CYP1A2 plays an important part in individualization of therapy.
CYP2C8 seems to be involved in diclofenac 5-hydroxylation, while, in vitro, the 4'-hydroxylation and 3'-hydroxylation seem to be mediated mainly by CYP2C9. We have demonstrated the relevance of CYP2C9 genotypes for diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation in healthy volunteers, so that the present study was aimed at analyzing the role of both CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 genotypes on diclofenac metabolism, as well as determining the CYP2C8 allele frequencies and their relationship with CYP2C9 variants.
"CA3 and subiculum are hippocampal formation regions that can initiate seizure activity because each has a substantial intrinsic excitatory connectivity. We studied the intrinsic connectivity of area CA1 by exploring the spread of synchronous population discharges in ventral hippocampal slices from rats using a recording chamber that permitted multiple simultaneous extracellular recordings along all laminae of CA1. Brief single stimulus pulses were applied to stratum oriens (SO) or stratum radiatum (SR) on the CA3 side or the subicular side of CA1. In disinhibited slices, events triggered with SO or SR stimulation on the CA3-side propagated over the proximo-distal extent of CA1 with a maximal conduction velocity of 0.4 m/s, comparable with antidromic conduction velocities within CA1. By contrast, SO or SR stimuli applied on the subicular side of CA1 triggered events that did not spread ""backward"" toward CA3. These events are rapidly decremented in amplitude and duration. Whereas antidromic responses were largest when stimuli were applied on the subicular side of CA1, such responses were not sufficient to trigger epileptiform discharges when excitatory transmission was intact. We conclude that the unidirectional spread of epileptiform activity in area CA1 is the result of an intrinsic axon collateral system where each pyramidal cell has a proportionally larger projection toward subiculum. Although this collateral system is sparse compared with other hippocampal formation regions, its unidirectionality protects against re-entrant activation of CA3 and may be physiologically significant as a relay from proximal CA1 to distal CA1."
TNNI3K is a new cardiac-specific MAP kinase whose gene is localized to 1p31.1 and that belongs to a tyrosine kinase-like branch in the kinase tree of the human genome. In the present study we investigated the role of TNNI3K in the cardiac myogenesis process and in the repair of ischemic injury. Pluripotent P19CL6 cells with or without transfection by pcDNA6-TNNI3K plasmid were used to induce differentiation into beating cardiomyocytes. TNNI3K promoted the differentiation process, judging from the increasing beating mass and increased number of alpha-actinin-positive cells. TNNI3K improved cardiac function by enhancing beating frequency and increasing the contractile force and epinephrine response of spontaneous action potentials without an increase of the single-cell size. TNNI3K suppressed phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I, annexin-V(+) cells, Bax protein, and p38/JNK-mediated apoptosis. Intramyocardial administration of TNNI3K-overexpressing P19CL6 cells in mice with myocardial infarction improved cardiac performance and attenuated ventricular remodeling compared with injection of wild-type P19CL6 cells. In conclusion, our study clearly indicates that TNNI3K promotes cardiomyogenesis, enhances cardiac performance, and protects the myocardium from ischemic injury by suppressing p38/JNK-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, modulation of TNNI3K activity would be a useful therapeutic approach for ischemic cardiac disease.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in cancer. Recent reports implicated Nedd4-1 as the E3 ubiquitin ligase for PTEN that regulates its stability and nuclear localization. We tested the physiological role of Nedd4-1 as a PTEN regulator by using cells and tissues derived from two independently generated strains of mice with their Nedd4-1 gene disrupted. PTEN stability and ubiquitination were indistinguishable between the wild-type and Nedd4-1-deficient cells, and an interaction between the two proteins could not be detected. Moreover, PTEN subcellular distribution, showing prominent cytoplasmic and nuclear staining, was independent of Nedd4-1 presence. Finally, activation of PKB/Akt, a major downstream target of cytoplasmic PTEN activity, and the ability of PTEN to transactivate the Rad51 promoter, a measure of its nuclear function, were unaffected by the loss of Nedd4-1. Taken together, our results fail to support a role for Nedd4-1 as the E3 ligase regulating PTEN stability and subcellular localization.
SLC5A8 is a member of the sodium/glucose cotransporter family. It has been proposed that SLC5A8 might act as an apical iodide transporter in the thyroid follicular cells or as a transporter of short chain monocarboxylates. We have directly addressed the functional role of SLC5A8 in vivo by generation of SLC5A8 mutant mice. We found that SLC5A8 is responsible for the re-absorption of lactate at the apical membrane of the kidney proximal tubules and of serous salivary gland ducts. In addition, SLC5A8 mediated the uptake of lactate into colonocytes under physiological conditions. We did not find any evidence of SLC5A8 being essential for the apical iodide transport in the thyroid gland, even if the ion-cotransporter SLC26A4, causing the human Pendred syndrome, is missing. Because SLC5A8 is transcriptionally silenced in many tumors, it has been proposed that SLC5A8-mediated transport of butyrate suppresses tumor formation. Treatment of Slc5a8(-/-) mice with carcinogens and breeding to the Apc(min) mouse line did not reveal a higher incidence of tumor formation. We conclude that SLC5A8 is instrumental in preventing lactaturia and loss of sodium-dependent uptake of lactate in the colon but does not have any apparent role in the prevention of tumor formation and growth.
ABCG2 is recognized as an important efflux transporter in clinical pharmacology and is potentially important in resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. To identify epigenetic mechanisms regulating ABCG2 mRNA expression at its 3' untranslated region (3'UTR), we performed 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends with the S1 parental colon cancer cell line and its drug-resistant ABCG2-overexpressing counterpart. We found that the 3'UTR is >1,500 bp longer in parental cells and, using the miRBase TARGETs database, identified a putative microRNA (miRNA) binding site, distinct from the recently reported hsa-miR520h site, in the portion of the 3'UTR missing from ABCG2 mRNA in the resistant cells. We hypothesized that the binding of a putative miRNA at the 3'UTR of ABCG2 suppresses the expression of ABCG2. In resistant S1MI80 cells, the miRNA cannot bind to ABCG2 mRNA because of the shorter 3'UTR, and thus, mRNA degradation and/or repression on protein translation is relieved, contributing to overexpression of ABCG2. This hypothesis was rigorously tested by reporter gene assays, mutational analysis at the miRNA binding sites, and forced expression of miRNA inhibitors or mimics. The removal of this epigenetic regulation by miRNA could be involved in the overexpression of ABCG2 in drug-resistant cancer cells.
CD38 is a 45-kD ectoenzyme involved in the synthesis of potent calcium (Ca(2+))-mobilizing agents, cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose (cADPR), and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP+). In HIV-1-infected patients, increased CD38 expression on CD8+ T cells is linked to immune system activation and progression of HIV-1 infection. However, the role of CD38 upregulation in astrocyte function and HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD-now called HAND: HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder) neuropathogenesis is unclear. To these ends, we used interleukin (IL)-1beta and HIV-1gp120 to activate primary human astrocytes and measured CD38 expression using real-time polymerase chain reaction and CD38 function by ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity. We also determined cADPR-mediated changes in single-cell intracellular Ca(2+) transients in activated astrocytes in presence or absence of ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid. CD38 levels were downregulated using CD38 small-interfering RNA (siRNA) and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) was measured. We previously reported a approximately 20-fold rise in CD38 messenger RNA levels in IL-1beta-activated astrocytes. We extend this observation and report that HIV-1gp120 potentiated CD38 expression in a dose-dependent manner and also increased CD38 enzyme activity in control and IL-1beta-activated astrocytes. We demonstrate higher cADPR levels in IL-1beta-activated astrocytes with a corresponding rise in [Ca(2+)](i) upon cADPR application and its non-hydrolysable analog, 3-deaza-cADPR. In activated astrocytes, pre-treatment with the cADPR-specific antagonist 8-Br-cADPR and CD38 siRNA transfection returned elevated [Ca(2+)](i) to baseline, thus confirming a CD38-cADPR specific response. These data are important for unraveling the mechanisms underlying the role of astrocyte-CD38 in HAD and have broader implications in other inflammatory diseases involving astrocyte activation and CD38 dysregulation.
SETD2 (SET domain containing protein 2) is a histone H3K36 trimethyltransferase protein that associates with hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II and involves in transcriptional elongation. However, whether and how SETD2 is implicated in the specific regulation of gene transcription remains unknown. Here we show that SETD2 could interact with p53 and selectively regulate the transcription factor activity of p53. The interaction was dependent of C-terminal region of SETD2, which contains the SET and WW domains, and the N-terminal transactivation domain (residues 1-45) of p53. Overexpression of SETD2 upregulated the expression levels of a subset of p53 targets including puma, noxa, p53AIP1, fas, p21, tsp1, huntingtin, but downregulated that of hdm2. In contrast, it had no significant effect on those of 14-3-3sigma, gadd45 and pig3. Consistently, knockdown of endogenous SETD2 expression by RNA interference resulted in converse effects as expected. In p53-deficient H1299 cells, SETD2 lost the ability to regulate these gene expression except hdm2, indicating the dependence of p53. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SETD2 downregulated hdm2 expression by targeting its P2 promoter and then enhanced p53 protein stability. Collectively, these findings suggest that the histone methyltransferase SETD2 could selectively regulate the transcription of subset genes via cooperation with the transcription factor p53.
CBS domains are small protein motifs, usually associated in tandem, that are implicated in binding to adenosyl groups. Several genetic diseases in humans have been associated with mutations in CBS sequences, which has made them very promising targets for rational drug design. Trigonal crystals of the CBS-domain protein MJ0729 from Methanococcus jannaschii were grown by the vapour-diffusion method at acidic pH. Preliminary analysis of nine X-ray diffraction data sets using Yeates statistics and Britton plots showed that slight variation in the pH as well as in the buffer used in the crystallization experiments led to crystals with different degrees of merohedral twinning that may vary from perfect hemihedral twinning to perfect tetartohedral twinning.
PC (pyruvate carboxylase) is a biotin-containing enzyme that catalyses the HCO(3)(-)- and MgATP-dependent carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate. This is a very important anaplerotic reaction, replenishing oxaloacetate withdrawn from the tricarboxylic acid cycle for various pivotal biochemical pathways. PC is therefore considered as an enzyme that is crucial for intermediary metabolism, controlling fuel partitioning toward gluconeogenesis or lipogenesis and in insulin secretion. The enzyme was discovered in 1959 and over the last decade there has been much progress in understanding its structure and function. PC from most organisms is a tetrameric protein that is allosterically regulated by acetyl-CoA and aspartate. High-resolution crystal structures of the holoenzyme with various ligands bound have recently been determined, and have revealed details of the binding sites and the relative positions of the biotin carboxylase, carboxyltransferase and biotin carboxyl carrier domains, and also a unique allosteric effector domain. In the presence of the allosteric effector, acetyl-CoA, the biotin moiety transfers the carboxy group between the biotin carboxylase domain active site on one polypeptide chain and the carboxyltransferase active site on the adjacent antiparallel polypeptide chain. In addition, the bona fide role of PC in the non-gluconeogenic tissues has been studied using a combination of classical biochemistry and genetic approaches. The first cloning of the promoter of the PC gene in mammals and subsequent transcriptional studies reveal some key cognate transcription factors regulating tissue-specific expression. The present review summarizes these advances and also offers some prospects in terms of future directions for the study of this important enzyme.
UCP2 is expressed in pancreatic beta cells where its postulated uncoupling activity will modulate glucose-induced changes in ATP/ADP ratio and insulin secretion. The consequences of UCP2 over/underexpression on beta-cell function has mainly been studied in the basal state; however, a UCP has no uncoupling activity unless stimulated by fatty acids and/or reactive oxygen species. Here, UCP2 was overexpressed in INS-1 cells and parameters reflecting mitochondrial coupling measured in the basal state and after stimulation by fatty acids. For comparison, UCP1 was expressed to similar levels and the same parameters measured. Neither UCP1 expression nor UCP2 overexpression modified basal or glucose-stimulated metabolic changes. Upon addition of fatty acids, UCP1-expressing cells displayed the expected mitochondrial uncoupling effect, while UCP2 did not elicit any measurable change in mitochondrial function. Taken together, our data demonstrate that, in pancreatic beta-cells, UCP2 has no uncoupling activity in the basal state or after fatty acid stimulation.
CYP2E1 is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of N-nitrosamines and other carcinogenic substances. Functional RsaI and 96-bp insertion polymorphisms in 5'-flanking region have drawn interest in relation to the risk of colorectal cancer. We investigated the relation of these genetic polymorphisms and colorectal adenoma, a well-established precursor lesion of colorectal cancer. Subjects were 455 cases of colorectal adenomas and 1,052 controls of normal colonoscopy among men receiving a preretirement health examination in the Self Defense Forces. Genotypes were determined by either PCR-RFLP or PCR method. Statistical adjustment was made for smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, physical activity, and others. Individuals with RsaI c2 allele showed a decreased risk of proximal colon adenomas; adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of proximal and distal adenomas for the c1/c2 or c2/c2 genotype versus c1/c1 was 0.61 (0.41-0.88) and 0.95 (0.71-1.27), respectively. CYP2E1 96-bp insertion allele was associated with an increased risk of large (> or = 5 mm) adenomas; adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of large and small adenomas for having at least one insertion allele were 1.41 (1.03-1.94) and 0.94 (0.71-1.25), respectively. A suggestive effect modification was noted for alcohol consumption on the association between RsaI polymorphism and proximal adenomas (P(interaction) = 0.09) as well as on the association between 96-bp insertion and large adenomas (P(interaction) = 0.05). These findings indicate that variation in activity and inducibility of CYP2E1 contribute to the development of colorectal carcinogenesis.
KL 4 is a 21-residue peptide employed as a functional mimic of lung surfactant protein B, which successfully lowers surface tension in the alveoli. A mechanistic understanding of how KL 4 affects lipid properties has proven elusive as the secondary structure of KL 4 in lipid preparations has not been determined at high resolution. The sequence of KL 4 is based on the C-terminus of SP-B, a naturally occurring helical protein that binds to lipid interfaces. The spacing of the lysine residues in KL 4 precludes the formation of a canonical amphipathic alpha-helix; qualitative measurements using Raman, CD, and FTIR spectroscopies have given conflicting results as to the secondary structure of the peptide as well as its orientation in the lipid environment. Here, we present a structural model of KL 4 bound to lipid bilayers based on solid state NMR data. Double-quantum correlation experiments employing (13)C-enriched peptides were used to quantitatively determine the backbone torsion angles in KL 4 at several positions. These measurements, coupled with CD experiments, verify the helical nature of KL 4 when bound to lipids, with (phi, psi) angles that differ substantially from common values for alpha-helices of (-60, -45). The average torsion angles found for KL 4 bound to POPC:POPG lipid vesicles are (-105, -30); this deviation from ideal alpha-helical structure allows KL 4 to form an amphipathic helix at the lipid interface.
AMPD1 is the muscle-specific form of the AMPD multigene families in mammals and plays an important role in the purine nucleotide cycle and energy metabolism in skeletal muscle. In this study, we cloned and characterized AMPD1 from Sus scrofa muscle. The promoter of porcine AMPD1 contained several putative muscle-specific transcription factor binding sites (E box, myogenin, MEF2, Spl-CTF/NF-l), one RORalpha2 binding motif and NF-kappaB site. The deduced amino acid sequence of porcine AMPD1 contains an AMP deaminase signature sequence (SLSTDDP). RT-PCR analyses showed that AMPD1 was expressed specifically in skeletal muscle. Expression of AMPD1 was up-regulated during the muscle development and was higher in Yorkshire than in Meishan pigs. AMPD1 gene was expressed at higher levels in longissimus dorsi and bicepsfemoris muscles compared with soleus and masseter muscles in both Yorkshire and Meishan pigs. Moreover, we found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, T/C(426)) in exon12 of the AMPD1 gene was significantly associated with loin muscle area trait (p<0.01), loin muscle height (p<0.01) and average backfat thickness (p<0.05). This result suggests that the AMPD1 gene might be a candidate gene of meat production trait and provides useful information for further studies on its roles in porcine skeletal muscle.
PAH are particularly monitored because of their carcinogenic properties and their ubiquity in the environment. Their presence in municipal sewage sludge is a major problem due to the environmental risks associated with the sludge spreading on agricultural soils. The objective of this work was to asses the removal of PAH naturally present in sludge by continuous anaerobic digestion with recirculation of ozonated sludge. Recirculation of ozonated digested sludge allowed to enhance PAH removals, the highest efficiency was obtained with the highest ozone dose (0.11gO(3)/g(TS)). In order to study the effect of recirculation, a reactor was operated without recirculation but was fed with a mixture of raw and ozonated digested sludge. This process led to the best performances in terms of PAH and solid removals. This pointed out some accumulation of nonbiodegradable or recalcitrant compounds during recirculation assay. Smallest and most soluble compounds presented the highest biodegradation efficiencies.
SLC26A6 (putative anion transporter 1, PAT1) has been shown to play an important role in mediating the luminal Cl(-)/OH(-)(HCO(3)(-)) exchange process in the intestine. Very little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of intestinal SLC26A6 gene expression in the intestine. Current studies were, therefore, designed to clone and characterize the 5'-regulatory region of the human SLC26A6 gene and determine the mechanisms involved in its regulation. A 1,120 bp (p-964/+156) SLC26A6 promoter fragment cloned upstream to the luciferase reporter gene in pGL2-basic exhibited high promoter activity when transfected in Caco2 cells. Progressive deletions of the 5'-flanking region demonstrated that -214/-44 region of the promoter harbors cis-acting elements important for maximal SLC26A6 promoter activity. Since, diarrhea associated with inflammatory bowel diseases is attributed to increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, we examined the effects of IFNgamma (30 ng/ml, 24 h) on SLC26A6 function, expression and promoter activity. IFNgamma decreased both SLC26A6 mRNA and function and repressed SLC26A6 promoter activity. Deletion analysis indicated that IFNgamma response element is located between -414/-214 region and sequence analysis of this region revealed the presence of potential Interferon Stimulated Responsive Element (ISRE), a binding site (-318/-300 bp) for interferon regulatory factor-1 transcription factor (IRF-1). Mutations in the potential ISRE site abrogated the inhibitory effects of IFNgamma. These studies provided novel evidence for the involvement of IRF-1 in the regulation of SLC26A6 gene expression by IFNgamma in the human intestine.
ABCG2 confers resistance to cancer cells by mediating the ATP-dependent outward efflux of chemotherapeutic compounds. Recent studies have indicated that the protein contains a number of interconnected drug binding sites. The present investigation examines the coupling of drug binding to ATP hydrolysis. Initial drug binding to the protein requires a high-affinity interaction with the drug binding site, followed by transition and reorientation to the low-affinity state to enable dissociation at the extracellular face. [3H]Daunomycin binding to the ABCG2 R482G isoform was examined in the nucleotide-bound and post-hydrolytic conformations. Binding of [3H]daunomycin was displaced by ATP analogues, indicating transition to a low-affinity conformation prior to hydrolysis. The low-affinity state was observed to be retained immediately post-hydrolysis. Therefore, the dissociation of phosphate and/or ADP is likely to be responsible for resetting of the transporter. The data indicate that, like ABCB1 and ABCC1, the 'power stroke' for translocation in ABCG2 R482G is the binding of nucleotide.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is a tumor suppressor gene identified on human chromosome 10q23. Substantial studies have demonstrated that PTEN can inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion of many cancer cells. The purpose of this study was to determine whether upregulation of PTEN gene by transfection wild-type PTEN gene to ovarian cancer cells can inhibit growth and migration and to explore the potential for PTEN gene therapy of ovarian cancers.
GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms were studied in Shorians, Teleuts, and Caucasians of the Kemerovo region. It has been shown that distribution of homozygous deletions in the examined groups is significantly heterogeneous. The frequency of deletion genotypes and combinations of deletion in these genes was lower in Shorians and, Teleuts than in Caucasians.
CYP3A4 induction is not generally considered to be a concern for safety; however, serious therapeutic failures can occur with drugs whose exposure is lower as a result of more rapid metabolic clearance due to induction. Despite the potential therapeutic consequences of induction, little progress has been made in quantitative predictions of CYP3A4 induction-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) from in vitro data. In the present study, predictive models have been developed to facilitate extrapolation of CYP3A4 induction measured in vitro to human clinical DDIs. The following parameters were incorporated into the DDI predictions: 1) EC(50) and E(max) of CYP3A4 induction in primary hepatocytes; 2) fractions unbound of the inducers in human plasma (f(u, p)) and hepatocytes (f(u, hept)); 3) relevant clinical in vivo concentrations of the inducers ([Ind](max, ss)); and 4) fractions of the victim drugs cleared by CYP3A4 (f(m, CYP3A4)). The values for [Ind](max, ss) and f(m, CYP3A4) were obtained from clinical reports of CYP3A4 induction and inhibition, respectively. Exposure differences of the affected drugs in the presence and absence of the six individual inducers (bosentan, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, efavirenz, phenobarbital, and rifampicin) were predicted from the in vitro data and then correlated with those reported clinically (n = 103). The best correlation was observed (R(2) = 0.624 and 0.578 from two hepatocyte donors) when f(u, p) and f(u, hept) were included in the predictions. Factors that could cause over- or underpredictions (potential outliers) of the DDIs were also analyzed. Collectively, these predictive models could add value to the assessment of risks associated with CYP3A4 induction-based DDIs by enabling their determination in the early stages of drug development.
CYP2J2 is one of the cytochrome P450 epoxygenases involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid. CYP2J2 has been identified in several tissues, especially cardiovascular tissues. CYP2J2 has cardiovascular effects, as epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, one of its metabolites, has anti-inflammatory and vasodilative activities. We investigated the expression of CYP2J2 in human leukocytes using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting and immunostaining. Human monocytic cells, but not human neutrophils, exhibited constitutive expression of CYP2J2. Furthermore, the expression of CYP2J2 mRNA increased when the human monocytic cell line THP-1 cells and human monocytes were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and macrophage-colony stimulating factor in combination with granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor, respectively. These results suggest that expression of CYP2J2 was up-regulated when human monocytes differentiated into macrophages and that human monocytic cells and macrophages have a pathway to metabolize arachidonic acid using CYP epoxygenases.
"PIK3CA mutations at 9 and 20 exons were studied in a series of 56 selected aggressive breast carcinomas (BC): 27 with Her-2 over-expression and negativity for estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR), and 29 ""triple negative"" BC (negative for ER, PR and Her-2). Also, immunohistochemical studies of p53, ki-67, Her-1 (EGFR), pIGF-1R, PTEN, p110alpha, and pAkt were performed. Six mutations in exon 20 PIK3CA were identified among the 27 Her-2 positive BC, whereas only one exon 9 PIK3CA mutation was detected in a triple negative tumor (p = 0.035). Furthermore, PIK3CA mutations were associated with p110alpha over-expression (p = 0.001). Overall survival was shorter in cases with PIK3CA mutations (p = 0.015 in all series; and p = 0.041 for Her-2+ tumors), although multivariate analyses did not show statistical differences. No statistical significance was related with disease-free survival. Exon 20 PIK3CA mutations are relatively frequent in Her-2+ tumors and shorten survival, whereas neither exons 9 and 20 mutations seem related with ""triple negative"" breast carcinomas."
CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are important drug metabolizing enzymes and together metabolize about 18% of currently available drugs. Some of the important groups of drugs that are metabolized by them are antihypertensives, hypoglycemics, anticonvulsants, antiulcer drugs etc. Genes encoding these enzymes are polymorphically expressed. Thirty variant alleles for CYP2C9 and 21 for CYP2C19 have been reported. The frequencies of these polymorphic alleles show marked inter-ethnic variation. Several reports have been published showing the clinical importance of this polymorphism. This review summarizes the currently available important information on this topic.
LCT 13910 CC genotype is associated with lactose intolerance, a condition often resulting in reduced milk intake. Women with the CC genotype were found to have decreased serum calcium and reduced bone mineral density.
CD38 contains an ADP ribosylcyclase domain that mediates intracellular Ca(2+) signaling by the production of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), but the mechanisms by which the agonists activate this enzyme remain unclear. The present study tested a hypothesis that a special lipid-raft (LR) form, ceramide-enriched lipid platform, contributes to CD38 activation to produce cADPR in response to muscarinic type 1 (M(1)) receptor stimulation in bovine coronary arterial myocytes (CAMs). By confocal microscopic analysis, oxotremorine (Oxo), an M(1) receptor agonist, was found to increase LR clustering on the membrane with the formation of a complex of CD38 and LR components such as GM(1), acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), and ceramide, a typical ceramide-enriched macrodomain. At 80 microM, Oxo increased LR clustering by 78.8%, which was abolished by LR disruptors, methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MCD), or filipin. With the use of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technique, 15.5+/-1.9% energy transfer rate (vs. 5.3+/-0.9% of control) between CD38 and LR component, ganglioside M(1) was detected, further confirming the proximity of both molecules. In the presence of MCD or filipin, there were no FRET signals detected. In floated detergent-resistant membrane fractions, CD38 significantly increased in LR fractions of CAMs treated by Oxo. Moreover, MCD or filipin attenuated Oxo-induced production of cADPR via CD38. Functionally, Oxo-induced intracellular Ca(2+) release and coronary artery constriction via cADPR were also blocked by LR disruption or ASMase inhibition. These results provide the first evidence that the formation of ceramide-enriched lipid macrodomains is crucial for Oxo-induced activation of CD38 to produce cADPR in CAMs, and these lipid macrodomains mediate transmembrane signaling of M(1) receptor activation to produce second messenger cADPR.
ABO incompatible kidney transplantation using antigen-specific immunoadsorption is increasingly performed but data on outcome, complications and protocol biopsies are still scarce. The present prospective single-centre study was aimed at these issues.
CD38 is a type II glycoprotein that acts both as a bifunctional enzyme, responsible for the synthesis and hydrolysis of cyclic ADP-ribose, and as a signal-transducing surface receptor. Although CD38 was originally described as a plasma membrane molecule, several reports indicate that CD38 is expressed in the nucleus, even in cells known to be CD38 surface-negative. In this study, firstly we investigated the presence of nuclear CD38 by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy using a panel of hematopoietic cell lines that exhibit different levels of CD38 plasma membrane expression. Our second aim was to explore the relationship between the nuclear and plasma membrane forms of CD38 in human cell lines which represent discrete early maturation stages of the human lymphoid and myeloid compartments. Our results indicate that CD38 is constitutively present in the nucleus of cells belonging to distinct lineages. Furthermore, nuclear CD38 appears to be independent of the plasma membrane pool. The presence of nuclear CD38 during different stages of hematopoietic differentiation suggests that it may play a role in the control of nuclear Ca(2+) homeostasis and NAD levels.
CYP2E1 enzyme is related to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to its ability for reactive oxygen species production, which can be influenced by polymorphisms in the gene. The aim of this study was to investigate hepatic levels, activity, and polymorphisms of the CYP2E1 gene to correlate it with clinical and histological features in 48 female obese NASH patients. Subjects were divided into three groups: (i) normal; (ii) steatosis; and (iii) steatohepatitis. CYP2E1 protein level was assayed in microsomes from liver biopsies, and in vivo chlorzoxazone hydroxylation was determined by HPLC. Genomic DNA was isolated for genotype analysis through PCR. The results showed that liver CYP2E1 content was significantly higher in the steatohepatitis (45%; p=0.024) and steatosis (22%; p=0.032) group compared with normal group. Chlorzoxazone hydroxylase activity showed significant enhancement in the steatohepatitis group (15%, p=0.027) compared with the normal group. c2 rare allele of RsallPstl polymorphisms but no C allele of Dral polymorphism was positively associated with CHZ hydroxylation, which in turn is correlated with liver CYP2E1 content (r=0.59; p=0.026). In conclusion, c2 allele is positively associated with liver injury in NASH. This allele may determine a higher transcriptional activity of the gene, with consequent enhancement in pro-oxidant activity of CYP2E1 thus affording liver toxicity.
G6PD deficiency is very frequent with almost 400 millions of patients worldwide in Asia, Africa and Mediterranean. G6PD deficiency is involved in mild or severe haemolysis and the precipitating factor is usually a drug. More than 100 drugs have been implicated and fluoroquinolones are one of the more classic. However, the literature review shows that only a few observations have been clearly documented.
ABO major compatibility is essential in transfusions of red blood cells but is not requisite in PLT transfusions. In adults there is some evidence that transfusion efficacy of ABO blood group-identical platelets (PLTs) is superior to major-mismatched PLTs. However, in children this question has not been investigated for more than 30 years.
ABCA1 exports cholesterol and phospholipids from cells by a multistep pathway that involves forming cell surface lipid domains, solubilizing these lipids by apolipoproteins, binding of apolipoproteins to ABCA1, and activating signaling processes. Here we used a mutational analysis approach to evaluate the relationship between these events. We prepared seven naturally occurring mutants and one artificial missense mutant of ABCA1 with varying degrees of impaired function, expressed them to similar levels as wild-type ABCA1 on the cell surface of BHK cells, and measured ABCA1-dependent lipid export, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) binding, and signaling activities. Linear regression analyses showed that cholesterol and phospholipid efflux and cellular apoA-I binding correlated significantly with the ability of ABCA1 to form cell surface lipid domains. Lipid export and cellular apoA-I binding activities and formation of lipid domains also correlated with the amount of apoA-I that could be cross-linked to ABCA1. Moreover, each of these lipid export and apoA-I binding activities correlated with apoA-I-induced Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) activation. Thus, these missense mutations in ABCA1 impair lipid export, apoA-I binding, and apoA-I-stimulated JAK2 activities to similar extents, indicating that these processes are highly interactive components of a pathway that functions to export lipids from cells.
CA1 pyramidal neurons receive two distinct excitatory inputs that are each capable of influencing hippocampal output and learning and memory. The Schaffer collateral (SC) input from CA3 axons onto the more proximal dendrites of CA1 is part of the trisynaptic circuit, which originates in Layer II of the entorhinal cortex (EC). The temporoammonic (TA) pathway to CA1 provides input directly from Layer III of the EC onto the most distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, and is involved in spatial memory and memory consolidation. We have previously described a developmental decrease in short-term facilitation from juvenile (P13-18) to young adult (P28-42) rats at SC synapses that is due to feedback inhibition via synaptically activated mGluR1 on CA1 interneurons. It is not known how short-term changes in synaptic strength are regulated at TA synapses, nor is it known how short-term plasticity is balanced at SC and TA inputs during development. Here we describe a novel developmental increase in short-term facilitation at TA synapses, which is the opposite of the decrease in facilitation occurring at SC synapses. Although short-term facilitation is much lower at TA synapses when compared with SC synapses in juveniles, short-term plasticity at SC and TA synapses converges at similar levels of paired-pulse facilitation in the young adult rat. However, in young adults CA3-CA1 synapses still exhibit more facilitation than TA-CA1 synapses during physiologically-relevant activity, suggesting that the two pathways are each poised to uniquely modulate CA1 output in an activity-dependent manner. Finally, we show that there is a developmental decrease in the initial release probability at TA synapses that underlies their developmental decrease in facilitation, but no developmental change in release probability at SC synapses. This represents a fundamental difference in the presynaptic function of the two major inputs to CA1, which could alter the flow of information in hippocampus during development.
PTEN regulates cell homeostasis by inhibiting growth signals transduced through PI3-kinases. The gene is mutated in several cancer types, but so far, only a limited number of mutations have been reported in colorectal cancer. In the present study, direct sequencing was used to analyze the whole coding region and exon-intron boundaries of PTEN in a series of microsatellite stable (n=34) and microsatellite unstable (n=30) colorectal carcinomas with known TP53 mutation status. We detected 21 PTEN mutations in altogether 13 tumors (20%), including 19 mutations in the coding sequence and two in the exon-intron boundaries. Sixteen of these alterations have not been previously reported in colorectal cancer. Furthermore, seven out of the 13 altered tumors harbored more than one mutation, potentially leading to loss of gene function. Finally, all PTEN mutations found were in tumors harboring wild-type TP53. In conclusion, PTEN is mutated in a significant subgroup of colorectal carcinomas, and our findings further extend the previously small spectrum of reported PTEN changes. Additionally, it seems that mutations in PTEN and TP53 are mutually exclusive for this cancer type.
AKR1B10 has been identified as a potential biomarker for human nonsmall cell lung carcinoma and as a tobacco exposure and response gene. AKR1B10 functions as an efficient retinal reductase in vitro and may regulate retinoic acid homeostasis. However, the possibility that this enzyme is able to activate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) trans-dihydrodiols to form reactive and redox-active o-quinones has not been investigated to date. AKR1B10 was found to oxidize a wide range of PAH trans-dihydrodiol substrates in vitro to yield PAH o-quinones. Reactions of AKR1B10 proceeded with improper stereochemistry, since it was specific for the minor (+)-benzo[a]pyrene-7S,8S-dihydrodiol diastereomer formed in vivo. However, AKR1B10 displayed reasonable activity in the oxidation of both the (-)-R,R and (+)-S,S stereoisomers of benzo[g]chrysene-11,12-dihydrodiol and oxidized the potentially relevant, albeit minor, (+)-benz[a]anthracene-3S,4S-dihydrodiol metabolite. We find that AKR1B10 is therefore likely to play a contributing role in the activation of PAH trans-dihydrodiols in human lung. AKR1B10 retinal reductase activity was confirmed in vitro and found to be 5- to 150-fold greater than the oxidation of PAH trans-dihydrodiols examined. AKR1B10 was highly expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, and robust retinal reductase activity was measured in lysates of these cells. The much greater catalytic efficiency of retinal reduction compared to PAH trans-dihydrodiol metabolism suggests AKR1B10 may play a greater role in lung carcinogenesis through dysregulation of retinoic acid homeostasis than through oxidation of PAH trans-dihydrodiols.
ABO hemolytic disease of fetus and newborn (ABO-HDFN) occurs almost exclusively in infants of blood group A or B who are born to group O mothers because IgG anti-A or -B occurs more commonly in group O than in group A or B individuals. We report a case of clinically significant ABO-HDFN where the mother was blood group O with elevated IgG anti-A and anti-B titers and delivered a child with an A2B phenotype. This unusual ABO constellation between mother and infant was based on the inheritance of a rare ABO allele encoding for a glycosyltransferase capable of synthesizing both A and B antigens. Because both anti-A and anti-B antibodies may have been involved in hemolysis in this case, it may be relevant to consider the cisAB phenomenon when monitoring ABO-incompatible pregnancies and births.
CYP3A4 is an important xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme. We previously found that CYP2C55 is highly up-regulated in Cyp3a(-/-) mice. Here, we have further investigated the mechanism of regulation of CYP2C55 and other detoxifying systems in Cyp3a(-/-) mice. Induction studies with prototypical inducers demonstrated an important role for the nuclear receptors PXR and CAR in the up-regulation of CYP2C55. Subsequent diet-switch experiments revealed that food-derived xenobiotics are primarily responsible for the increased induction of CYP2C55, as well as of several other primary detoxifying systems in Cyp3a(-/-) mice. Our data suggest that CYP3A normally metabolizes food-derived activators of PXR and/or CAR, explaining the increased levels of such activators in Cyp3a(-/-) mice and subsequent up-regulation of a range of detoxifying systems. Interestingly, our studies with tissue-specific CYP3A4 transgenic Cyp3a(-/-) mice revealed that not only hepatic but also intestinal expression of CYP3A4 could reduce the hepatic expression of detoxifying systems to near wild-type levels. Apparently, intestinal CYP3A4 can limit the hepatic exposure to food-derived activators of nuclear receptors, thereby regulating the expression of a range of detoxifying systems in the liver. This broad biological effect further emphasizes the importance of intestinal CYP3A activity and could have profound implications for the prediction of drug exposure.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) tumor suppressor regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell proliferation, growth, migration and death. This master regulator itself is also under deliberative regulation. Although the evidence for PTEN regulation and its significance in normal biology and disease is overwhelming, the mechanisms and exact functional consequences of PTEN regulation are far from clear. In this review, we discuss recent advances concerning post-translational regulation of PTEN in general, and in more detail about its regulation by ubiquitination. We also discuss some unsolved questions in the field and how they might be addressed in the future. We propose that the complex regulatory mechanisms of PTEN dictate how this tumor suppressor executes its distinct biological functions.
CYP2C19 polymorphism plays an important role in the metabolism of proton pump inhibitors. The multidrug resistance (MDR)1 genotype is associated with the successful eradication of Helicobacter pylori. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of CYP2C19 and MDR1 genotypes on the eradication rate of H. pylori using a pantoprazole-based triple therapy.
NSF (nephrogenic systemic fibrosis) is a potentially serious adverse effect for renal patients undergoing MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) procedures using gadolinium-containing contrast agents. There is therefore a need to verify clearance of these agents and to confirm appropriate renal status of patients treated with these drugs.
ABCB1 is responsible for multidrug resistance, the principal mechanism by which many cancers develop resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. There is a controversy whether ABCB1 gene polymorphisms correlate with survival and response in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. We evaluated the association between clinical outcome (safety and efficacy) of paclitaxel monotherapy in metastatic breast cancer patients with ABCB1 gene polymorphisms 2677G>T/A or 3435C>T.
ABO incompatibility in organ transplantation is still a high risk factor for antibody-mediated rejection, despite the progress in effective treatments. We have explored the possibility of using the enzyme to remove the blood type A/B antigen in organs.
HSD17B1 is an important candidate gene in breast cancer via its role in converting estrone to estradiol. A nonsynonymous G-to-A transition (rs605059) and an intronic C-to-A (rs676387) single-nucleotide polymorphism, which captured most common variation in HSD17B1, were evaluated in several breast cancer studies with inconclusive results. We followed up these findings in the Polish Breast Cancer Study (1,995 cases; 2,296 controls) and the British Studies of Epidemiology and Risk Factors in Cancer Heredity study (4,470 cases; 4,560 controls). Meta-analyses of published data and our own were also conducted among Caucasian women. Consistent with previous reports, we found little to no association with overall risk for heterozygotes and minor allele homozygotes compared with major allele homozygotes for rs605059 [summary odds ratios (95% confidence intervals), 0.93 (0.87-0.99) for GA and 0.96 (0.85-1.08), based on 11,762 cases and 14,329 controls from 10 studies] and for rs676387 [summary odds ratios (95% confidence intervals), 1.04 (0.97-1.12) and 1.12 (0.99-1.27), based on analyses of 11,074 cases and 13,605 controls from 8 studies]. Data from the Polish [n=586 estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) cases] and British (n=407) studies did not support the previous findings that ER- tumors were inversely associated with rs676387 AA genotype and positively associated with rs605059 GG genotype, based on subanalyses in 5 prospective cohorts with 354 ER- cases. In conclusion, it is unlikely that common genetic variation in HSD17B1 is associated with a moderate modulation in breast cancer risk overall; however, we cannot exclude the possibility of a very weak effect. Associations between HSD17B1 genotypes and risk for ER- breast cancer were inconsistent across studies and should be studied further.
ACE inhibitors are widely prescribed for hypertension so it is essential to determine and compare their effects on blood pressure (BP), heart rate and withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAE).
MPO (myeloperoxidase) catalyses the oxidation of chloride, bromide and thiocyanate to their respective hypohalous acids. We have investigated the generation of HOBr by human neutrophils in the presence of physiological concentrations of chloride and bromide. HOBr was trapped with taurine and detected by monitoring the bromination of 4-HPAA (4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid). With 100 microM bromide and 140 mM chloride, neutrophils generated HOBr and it accounted for approx. 13% of the hypohalous acids they produced. Addition of SOD (superoxide dismutase) doubled the amount of HOBr detected. Therefore we investigated the reaction of superoxide radicals with a range of bromamines and bromamides and found that superoxide radicals stimulated the decomposition of these species, with this occurring in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The protection afforded by SOD against such decay demonstrates that these processes are superoxide-radical-dependent. These data are consistent with neutrophils generating HOBr at sites of infection and inflammation. Both HOBr and bromamines/bromamides have the potential to react with superoxide radicals to form additional radicals that may contribute to inflammatory tissue damage.
ABO incompatible (ABOi) live-donor renal transplantation is a successful and accepted form of treatment for patients with renal failure. Although there is significant controversy as to how antiblood group antibodies should be removed and their resynthesis prevented, subsequent immunosuppressive regimes have all involved steroids. We and other groups have successfully used steroid sparing regimes for conventional ABO compatible transplantation and this study describes the use of our steroid sparing protocol in ABOi transplantation.
CYP2C19 is a drug-metabolising enzyme involved in the metabolism of a number of chemotherapeutic agents including cyclophosphamide. Variants of the CYP2C19 gene result in a loss of function polymorphism, which affects approximately 3% of the Caucasian population. These individuals are poor metabolisers (PM) of a wide range of medications including omeprazole (OMP). In healthy subjects PM can be identified through homozygous variant genotype. However, a discordance between CYP2C19 genotype and phenotype has been reported previously in a small study of cancer patients. To investigate whether CYP2C19 activity was decreased in patients with advanced cancer, CYP2C19 genotype was determined in 33 advanced cancer patients using PCR-RFLP analysis for the two important allelic variants (*2,681G>A and *3,636G>A) and the activity of the enzyme was evaluated using the CYP2C19 probe drug OMP. The activity of the drug-metabolising enzyme CYP2C19 was severely compromised in advanced cancer patients, resulting in a PM status in 37% of the patients who had normal genotype. This is significantly (P<0.0005) higher than that would be predicted from the genotypic status of these patients. There was no evidence of a correlation between compromised CYP2C19 activity and any of the proinflammatory cytokines or acute phase response proteins studied. However, there was preliminary evidence of an association between PM status and low body mass (P=0.03). There is increasing interest in using pharmacogenetics to 'individualise medicine', however, the results of this study indicate that in a cancer population genotyping for CYP2C19 would significantly underestimate the number of phenotypic PM of drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, which may be metabolised by this enzyme.
ABCC2 has a wide tissue distribution and can mediate the efflux of a number of therapeutic compounds from cells and contribute to potential treatment failure. Its diverse expression and ability to efflux a number of substrates imply a number of physiological and pharmacological roles. CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 are responsible for the metabolism of a number of therapeutic compounds. Reports on the expression of these proteins in various cells and tissues have been contradictory mainly due to differences in experimental approach and cell type studied. With the advances in commercially available antibodies we describe here a simplified technique for the detection of ABCC2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by flow cytometry. Results are expressed as mean increase in fluorescence compared to isotypically matched controls. Using these assays we confirmed the expression of these proteins in human PBMC. These methods are rapid and reproducible and have potential use for both in vitro and clinical applications.
ABO incompatible transfusions are still a frequent cause of serious adverse transfusion reactions. Bedside check is intended to detect patient errors and prevent ABO mismatch. France is one of the few countries that includes ABO agglutination test for red blood cells in bedside checks. Evaluation of this ABO agglutination test, performed with a special card, shows that, on the field, despite frequent users' mishandling, it can detect up to 93% of ABO incompatibilities. This is not enough to rely on this sole test for bedside checks. But, linking it with an another test, currently, checks that the right blood is given to the right patient, rises the sensitivity of the whole bedside procedure up to an estimated 99.65%, for detection of ABO incompatibilities. This linkage has been introduced in the French regulation in 2003. Since then, the incidence of ABO incompatible transfusions has decreased dramatically and faster than in any other country, so France has now, probably, the lowest rate of ABO incompatible transfusions. The investigation of the few ABO accidents that still occur, shows that professionals have always bypassed this linkage. On the other hand, introducing bedside recipient and blood products barcode or radio-chip checks in all the 1500 French hospitals, though technically possible, would provide very little enhancement and lead to major difficulties and expenses. Linkage of ABO agglutination test to patient and blood checks within the bedside procedure has proved to be efficient and should be kept.
CBS domains are small protein motifs consisting of a three-stranded beta-sheet and two alpha-helices that are present in proteins of all kingdoms of life and in proteins with completely different functions. Several genetic diseases in humans have been associated with mutations in their sequence, which has made them promising targets for rational drug design. The C-terminal domain of the Methanococcus jannaschii protein MJ0100 includes a CBS-domain pair and has been overexpressed, purified and crystallized. Crystals of selenomethionine-substituted (SeMet) protein were also grown. The space group of both the native and SeMet crystals was determined to be orthorhombic P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 80.9, b = 119.5, c = 173.3 A. Preliminary analysis of the X-ray data indicated that there were eight molecules per asymmetric unit in both cases.
CYP4A11 oxidizes arachidonic acid to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a metabolite with renovascular and tubular function in humans. A previous study demonstrated a significant association between the CYP4A11 gene polymorphism and hypertension; however, the precise mechanism of the association has not been clarified. To assess the involvement of CYP4A11 in the pathogenesis of hypertension, we sought to identify a functional polymorphism of CYP4A11 and examined its impact on predisposition to hypertension in the Tanno-Sobetsu Study. The -845A/G polymorphism was identified in the promoter region of CYP4A11 by direct sequencing. Luciferase expression driven by the promoter of CYP4A11 containing the wild-type -845GG genotype was 30% lower than expression with the variant -845AA genotype. Gel mobility shift assays with nuclear protein extracts showed specific binding to probes containing the variant -845GG. To assess the effect of CYP4A11 polymorphisms on hypertension, we also carried out a case-control study using 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (-845A/G, -366C/T, 7119C/T, and 8590T/C) in the Tanno-Sobetsu Study. The odds ratio for hypertension in participants with the AG+GG genotype of -845A/G was 1.42 (P=0.008), and the odds ratio for hypertension of the TT genotype of 7119C/T was 1.37 (P=0.037) after adjusting for confounding factors. The haplotype-based case-control analysis using 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed a significant haplotype (G-C-T-T) that was significantly associated with hypertension, with an odds ratio of 1.44 (P=0.006) after adjusting for confounding factors. We have identified a functional variant (-845A/G) of CYP4A11 that is significantly associated with hypertension and that appears to be a novel candidate for a predisposing factor for hypertension.
STS are a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors that pose significant management challenges. The cornerstone of therapy for patients who have primary STS remains margin-negative resection. Adjuvant radiotherapy has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrence for extremity and trunk STS, although its role for retroperitoneal STS remains to be defined. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy has some theoretic advantages to postoperative radiation, but its exact role has yet to be determined. Chemotherapy is usually reserved for chemotherapy-sensitive histologic subtypes and for patients who have metastatic STS.
CYP4F2 acts primarily as an enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), a metabolite involved in the regulation of blood pressure in humans. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between the human CYP4F2 gene and essential hypertension (EH) using a haplotype-based case-control study that included separate analysis of the two gender groups. The 249 EH patients and 238 age-matched controls were genotyped for 5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the human CYP4F2 gene (rs3093105, rs3093135, rs1558139, rs2108622, rs3093200). Data were analyzed for 3 separate groups: all subjects, and men and women separately. For the total population and for male subjects, the distribution of the dominant model of rs1558139 (CC vs. CT+TT) differed significantly between the EH patients and control subjects (p=0.037 and p=0.005, respectively), with a higher percentage of EH patients showing the CC genotype. Logistic regression showed that, for men, the CC genotype of rs1558139 was more prevalent in the EH patients than in the control subjects (p=0.026), while, for the total population, the difference disappeared (p=0.247). For men, the overall distribution of the haplotypes was significantly different between the EH patients and the control subjects (p=0.042), and the frequency of the T-T-G haplotype was also significantly lower for EH patients than for control subjects (p=0.009). In conclusion, the present results indicate that rs1558139 might be a genetic marker for EH and the T-T-G haplotype might be a protective genetic marker for EH in Japanese men.
GALNT3 encodes UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-d-galactosamine: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferarase 3 (ppGalNacT3), a glycosyltransferase which has been suggested to prevent proteolysis of FGF23, a potent phosphaturic protein. Accordingly, loss-of-function mutations in GALNT3 cause hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis (HFTC), a rare autosomal recessive disorder manifesting with increased kidney reabsorption of phosphate, resulting in severe hyperphosphatemia and widespread ectopic calcifications. Although these findings definitely attribute a role to ppGalNacT3 in the regulation of phosphate homeostasis, little is currently known about the factors regulating GALNT3 expression. In addition, the effect of decreased GALNT3 expression in peripheral tissues has not been explored so far. In the present study, we demonstrate that GALNT3 expression is under the regulation of a number of factors known to be associated with phosphate homeostasis, including inorganic phosphate itself, calcium and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3). In addition, we show that decreased GALNT3 expression in human skin fibroblasts leads to increased expression of FGF7 and of matrix metalloproteinases, which have been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of ectopic calcification. Thus, the present data suggest that ppGalNacT3 may play a role in peripheral tissues of potential relevance to the pathogenesis of disorders of phosphate metabolism.
AGA IgA II and AGA IgG II have recently been suggested as reliable tools for celiac disease (CD) diagnosis. We compared their utility for diagnosis and monitoring CD in children with that of tTG IgA, an established CD marker.
NPR1 is a gene of central importance in enabling plants to resist microbial attack. Therefore, knowledge of nearby genes is important for genome analysis and possibly for improving disease resistance. In this study, systematic DNA sequence analysis, gene annotation, and protein BLASTs were performed to determine genes near the NPR1 gene in Beta vulgaris L., Medicago truncatula Gaertn, and Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray, and to access predicted function. Microsynteny was discovered for NPR1 with genes CaMP, encoding a chloroplast-targeted signal calmodulin-binding protein, and CK1PK, a CK1-class protein kinase. Conserved microsynteny of NPR1, CaMP, and CK1PK in three diverse species of eudicots suggests maintenance during evolution by positive selection for close proximity. Perhaps close physical linkage contributes to coordinated expression of these particular genes that may control critically important processes including nuclear events and signal transduction.
CYP2E1 is an important enzyme involved in the brain metabolism of ethanol that can be induced by chronic consumption of alcohol. Recent works have highlighted the importance of this system in the context of the behavioural effects of ethanol. Unfortunately, the underlying neurochemical events for these behavioural changes, has not been yet explored. In this work, we have started this exploration by analyzing the possible changes in the neurochemical response of the mesolimbic system to ethanol after pharmacological induction of brain CYP2E1. We have used the dopamine extracellular levels in nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell, measured by means of microdialysis in vivo, as an index of the effects of ethanol. Acetone 1% in the tap water was used to induce brain CYP2E1. Efficacy of the induction protocol was assessed by immunoblotting. Intravenous administration of 1.5 g/kg of ethanol in control rats provoked a significant increase of the dopamine levels in both the core (up to 127% of baseline) and the shell (up to 122% of baseline) of the NAc. However, the same dose of ethanol in acetone-treated rats only increased the dopamine extracellular levels in the core (up to 142% of baseline) whereas dopamine levels in the shell subregion remain unaltered relative to baseline. The results of this study indicate that induction of CYP2E1 changes the response of the mesolimbic system to ethanol in a region-dependent manner. Two hypotheses are postulated to explain the observed effects.
CYP2D6 genotyping using SNaPshot method is a very useful tool clinically. However it's hard to interpret the obtained data as a genotype without training. Thus SNaPshot auto-interpreter for the genotype was designed to interpret obtained raw data to a genotype. The auto-interpreter showed good concordance with experts' reading. The validated auto-interpreter of CYP2D6 genotyping using SNaPshot can contribute to accelerating the clinical use.
ABCG2 is a half-transporter initially described in multidrug-resistant cancer cells and lately identified as an important factor in the pharmacokinetics of its substrates. Q141K is by far the most intensively studied single nucleotide polymorphism of ABCG2 with potential clinical relevance. Here we used stably transfected HEK cells to study the Q141K polymorphism together with the deletion of amino acids 315-316, which were recently reported to coexist in two cancer cell lines (A549 and SK-OV-3). Functional studies confirmed our previous report that when normalized to surface expression, Q141K has impaired transport of mitoxantrone. This result was extended to include the ABCG2-specific substrate pheophorbide a. While we found no functional consequence of deleting amino acids 315 and 316, we did find that the deletion mutant is no longer recognized by the BXP-21 antibody. We conclude that amino acids 315 and 316 form part of the epitope for the BXP-21 antibody.
AKR1C3 (also known as 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5 or 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2) functions as a 3-keto, 17-keto and 20-ketosteroid reductase and as a 3alpha-, 17beta- and 20alpha-hydroxysteroid oxidase. Relatively high mRNA expression of AKR1C3 was found in human prostate and mammary gland where it is implicated in regulating ligand access to the androgen and estrogen receptor, respectively. AKR1C3 is an interesting target for the development of agents for treating hormone-dependent forms of cancer like prostate cancer, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer. However, only a few clinically promising and selective inhibitors have been reported so far. Very potent inhibitors of AKR1C3 are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, e.g. indomethacin or flufenamic acid. Also dietary phytoestrogens such as coumestrol, quercetin, and biochanin were reported to inhibit the enzyme in low micromolar concentrations. In this study, some dietary flavonoids and other phenolic compounds were tested for their ability to specifically inhibit AKR1C3. Carbonyl reduction of the anticancer drug oracin, which is a very good substrate for AKR1C3 and which could be well monitored by a sensitive HPLC system with fluorescence detection, was employed to determine the inhibitory potency of the compounds. Our results reveal that AKR1C3 could be potentially un-competitively inhibited by 2'-hydroxyflavanone, whose IC(50) value of 300nM is clinically promising. Moreover, since the inhibition is selective towards AKR1C3, 2'-hydroxyflavanone could be useful for treating or preventing hormone-dependent malignancies like prostate and breast cancer.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is a lipid phosphatase that regulates mitogenic signaling pathways, and deficiency of PTEN results in cell proliferation, survival, and malignancy. Murine liver-specific Pten deletion models develop liver malignancy by 12 months of age. Using this model, we describe a population of CD133+ liver cancer stem cells isolated during the chronic injury phase of disease progression and before primary carcinoma formation. We performed immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry isolation using livers from 3- and 6-month-old Pten(loxP/loxP); Alb-Cre+ mice (mutants) and controls. CD133+CD45- nonparenchymal (NP) cells were analyzed for gene expression profile and protein levels. Single CD133+CD45- oval cells were isolated for clonal expansion and tumor analysis. Cultured and freshly isolated liver CD133+CD45- and CD133-CD45- NP cells were injected into immune-deficient and immune-competent mice. In mutant mice, the NP fraction increased in CD133+CD45- cells in 3- and 6-month-old Pten-deleted animals compared with controls. Clone lines expanded from single CD133+CD45- cells demonstrated consistent liver progenitor cell phenotype, with bilineage gene expression of hepatocyte and cholangiocyte markers. CD133+ cells from expanded clone lines formed robust tumors in immune-deficient and immune-competent mice. Furthermore, freshly isolated CD133+CD45- NP liver cells from 6-month-old mutants formed tumors in vivo, and CD133-CD45- NP cells did not. Consistent with a cancer stem cell phenotype, CD133+ cells demonstrate resistance to chemotherapy agents compared with CD133- cells. CD133+CD45- nonparenchymal cells from chronic injury Pten(loxP/loxP); Alb-Cre+ mice represent a bipotent liver progenitor cell population with cancer stem cell phenotype.
PTEN acts as a tumor suppressor in a range of tissue types and has been implicated in the regulation of intestinal stem cells. To study Pten function in the intestine, we used various conditional transgenic strategies to specifically delete Pten from the mouse intestinal epithelium. We show that Pten loss specifically within the adult or embryonic epithelial cell population does not affect the normal architecture or homeostasis of the epithelium. However, loss of Pten in the context of Apc deficiency accelerates tumorigenesis through increased activation of Akt, leading to rapid development of adenocarcinoma. We conclude that Pten is redundant in otherwise normal intestinal epithelium and epithelial stem cells but, in the context of activated Wnt signaling, suppresses progression to adenocarcinoma through modulation of activated Akt levels.
CFTR contributes to HCO(3)(-) transport in epithelial cells both directly (by HCO(3)(-) permeation through the channel) and indirectly (by regulating Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange proteins). While loss of HCO(3)(-) transport is highly relevant to cystic fibrosis, the relative importance of direct and indirect HCO(3)(-) transport it is currently unknown.
CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes encode members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes primarily involved in xenobiotic and drug metabolism. In this paper we examined the effects of synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) on aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated regulation of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes and their enzymatic activity in primary cultures of human hepatocytes obtained from 17 donors and prepared in 3 countries. Dexamethasone significantly reduced both basal and inducible CYP1A1/2 ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activities by more than 75 and 50%, respectively. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU486 abolished this effect suggesting the involvement of GR in the process. In contrast, dexamethasone significantly augmented transcriptional activation of CYP1A2 mRNA but not CYP1A1 gene by prototype AhR ligands 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC). Dexamethasone had no effect on basal and TCDD-inducible levels of CYP1As proteins; however, it reduced the levels of AhR and GRalpha mRNAs and AhR protein levels. In addition, using RT(2) Profiler PCR Array, we found the effect of dexamethasone on the expression of several co-activators of AhR and GR nuclear receptors in the primary human hepatocytes. We conclude that dexamethasone controls CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 expression and activity in human hepatocytes via multiple mechanisms, which remain to be elucidated.
RPE cell activation is an important feature of autoimmune uveitis. This investigation focused on whether extracellular nucleotides could contribute to this activation, and the effects of ATPgammaS, UTP, and UDP on the production of IL-8 by RPE cells was studied in relation to their expression of functional P2Y receptors.
PTEN is a dual lipid and protein phosphatase that antagonizes PI3K as well as other signaling pathways and regulates cellular survival and growth. However, its potential role in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury remains unknown. We established a transgenic mouse model with inducible and cardiac specific deletion of Pten gene (Pten(CKO)) in adult heart via tamoxifen dependent Cre-loxP mediated DNA recombination. 3 weeks after tamoxifen induced PTEN inactivation, elevated PI3K activity was observed in the Pten(CKO) hearts as determined from downstream AKT signaling. No significant differences in cardiac function as well as chamber size were observed between Pten(CKO) and Control animals based on echocardiography. In response to 30 min ischemia followed by 120 min reperfusion in Langendorff preparations, Pten(CKO) hearts developed significantly better function recovery than Control animals. At 60 min post reperfusion, the recovery of LVDP reached 77.9% of pre-ischemia basal in Pten(CKO) hearts vs 44.2% of Control (p<0.01). Consistent with the observed functional improvement, TTC staining revealed a significant reduction in infarct size in Pten(CKO) hearts compared with Control (24.2% vs 39.7%, p<0.05). Pten(CKO) hearts had significantly fewer apoptosis positive cardiomyocytes after I/R injury as identified by TUNEL staining. Furthermore, ERK activity and BCL-2 expression were not affected at basal but became significantly higher after ischemia/reperfusion in Pten(CKO) hearts. These data indicate that PTEN may play a role in ischemia/reperfusion injury by inhibiting anti-apoptotic survival signals. Inhibiting PTEN may serve as a potential approach to exert cardiac protection against ischemia reperfusion injury.
CYP2C9 is a significant P450 protein responsible for drug metabolism. With the increased use of heterocyclic compounds in drug design, a rapid and efficient predrug screening of these potential type II binding compounds is essential to avoid adverse drug reactions. To understand binding modes, we use quinoline-4-carboxamide analogues to study the factors that determine the structure-activity relationships. The results of this study suggest that the more accessible pyridine with the nitrogen para to the linkage can coordinate directly with the ferric heme iron, but this is not seen for the meta or ortho isomers. The pi-cation interaction of the naphthalene moiety and Arg 108 residue may also assist in stabilizing substrate binding within the active-site cavity. The type II substrate binding affinity is determined by the combination of steric, electrostatic, and hydrophobicity factors; meanwhile, it is enhanced by the strength of lone pair electrons coordination with the heme iron.
ABCA4 is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that is expressed in rod and cone photoreceptor cells and implicated in the removal of retinal derivatives from outer segments following photoexcitation. Mutations in the ABCA4 gene are responsible for a number of related retinal degenerative diseases, including Stargardt macular degeneration, cone-rod dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, and age-related macular degeneration. In order to determine the role of the C terminus of ABCA4 in protein structure and function and understand mechanisms by which C-terminal mutations cause retinal degenerative diseases, we have expressed and purified a series of deletion and substitution mutants of ABCA4 and ABCA1 in HEK 293T cells for analysis of their cellular localization and biochemical properties. Removal of the C-terminal 30 amino acids of ABCA4, including a conserved VFVNFA motif, resulted in a loss in N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine substrate binding, ATP photoaffinity labeling, and retinal-stimulated ATPase activity. This mutant was also retained in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells. Replacement of the VFVNFA motif with alanine residues also resulted in loss in function and cellular mislocalization. In contrast, C-terminal deletion mutants that retain the VFVNFA motif were functionally active and localized to intracellular vesicles similar to wild-type ABCA4. Our studies indicated that the VFVNFA motif is required for the proper folding of ABCA4 into a functionally active protein. This motif also contributes to the efficient folding of ABCA1 into an active protein. Our results provide a molecular based rationale for the disease phenotype displayed by individuals with mutations in the C terminus of ABCA4.
CYP19A1 encodes for aromatase, which irreversibly converts androgens to estrogens; variation in this gene may affect individual susceptibility to breast cancer and other sex hormone-dependent outcomes. In a case-control study nested within a breast self-examination trial conducted in China, we examined whether CYP19A1 polymorphisms (rs1870049, rs1004982, rs28566535, rs936306, rs11636639, rs767199, rs4775936, rs11575899, rs10046, and rs4646) were associated with risk of breast cancer and fibrocystic breast conditions. Cases were diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 614) or fibrocystic breast conditions (n = 465) during 1989 to 2000. Controls were free of breast disease during the same period (n = 879). Presence of proliferative changes within the extratumoral tissue of women with breast cancer and the lesions of women with fibrocystic conditions only was assessed. None of the polymorphisms were associated with overall risk of breast cancer or fibrocystic breast conditions. Differences in breast cancer risk, however, were observed by proliferation status. The risk of breast cancer with (but not without) proliferative fibrocystic conditions was increased among women homozygous for the minor allele of rs1004982 (C), rs28566535 (C), rs936306 (T), and rs4775936 (C) relative to those homozygous for the major allele [age-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals), 2.19 (1.24-3.85), 2.20 (1.27-3.82), 1.94 (1.13-3.30), and 1.95 (1.07-3.58), respectively]. Also, haplotypes inferred using all polymorphisms were not associated with overall risk of either outcome, although some block-specific haplotypes were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer with concurrent proliferative fibrocystic conditions. Our findings suggest that CYP19A1 variation may enhance breast cancer development in some women, but further confirmation is warranted.
ABCA1 is a key mediator of cholesterol efflux to apoA-I in cholesterol loaded macrophages, a first step of RCT in vivo. Unsaturated fatty acids can inhibit cholesterol efflux from macrophages by increasing degradation of ABCA1. However, the detailed mechanisms of ABCA1 regulation by unsaturated fatty acids are not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of EPA on ABCA1 expression and ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux and examined the role of cAMP/PKA pathway on the regulation of ABCA1 by EPA in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. Results showed that EPA significantly destabilized ABCA1 protein and reduced ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux but had no effect on ABCA1 mRNA expression. We also revealed that EPA markedly reduced cAMP level and PKA activity and ABCA1 serine phosphorylation. PKA-specific activation by PKA agonist markedly compensated the down-regulation of ABCA1 serine phosphorylation and ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux by EPA, while, siRNA of PKA leaded to reduce of ABCA1 serine phosphorylation and ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux more significantly than EPA. However, EPA-Induced enhancement of degradation rate of ABCA1 protein did not change by treatment with PKA agonist or PKA-siRNA. These results provide evidence that EPA may have dual negative effects on ABCA1 activity by decreasing ABCA1 protein level and by reducing PKA-mediated ABCA1 serine phosphorylation in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells.
UCP2 and UCP3, two novel uncoupling proteins, are important regulators of energy expenditure and thermogenesis in various organisms. The striking disparity between UCP2 mRNA and protein levels in muscle tissues prompted initial speculation that microRNAs are implicated in the regulatory pathway of UCP2. We found, for the first time, that the repression of UCP2 expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle resulted from its targeting by a muscle-specific microRNA, miR-133a. Moreover, our findings illustrate a novel function of UCP2 as a brake for muscle development. We also show that MyoD can remove the braking role of UCP2 via direct up-regulation of miR-133a during myogenic differentiation. Taken together, our current work delineates a novel regulatory network employing MyoD, microRNA, and uncoupling proteins to fine-tune the balance between muscle differentiation and proliferation during myogenesis.
PTEN plays a critical role in the development and progression of many cancers. PTEN may act directly or indirectly to integrate complex signal network system, to influence the downstream signal pathway and target molecules. This study was to investigate the impact of PTEN gene knockout in human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells on the activity of JNK pathway.
WWOX and FHIT are two candidate tumor suppressor genes located in active fragile sites, the damage of which has been associated with the development of breast cancer. The association of the expression of these genes and the development of breast cancer has not been fully explored. We evaluated mRNA and protein expression of WWOX and FHIT in breast tissue with normal histological appearances, atypical ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ, and invasive cancer to see if a progressive decline in expression was present.
PLA2G6 mutations are known to be responsible for infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). In addition, novel mutations in PLA2G6 have recently been associated with dystonia-parkinsonism in two unrelated consanguineous families.
RDH10 (retinol dehydrogenase 10) was originally identified from the retinal pigment epithelium and retinal Müller cells. It has retinoid oxidoreductase activity and is thought to play a role in the retinoid visual cycle. A recent study showed that RDH10 is essential for generating retinoic acid at early embryonic stages. The present study demonstrated that wild-type RDH10 catalysed both oxidation of all-trans-retinol and reduction of all-trans-retinal in a cofactor-dependent manner In vitro. In cultured cells, however, oxidation is the favoured reaction catalysed by RDH10. Substitution of any of the predicted key residues in the catalytic centre conserved in the RDH family abolished the enzymatic activity of RDH10 without affecting its protein level. Unlike other RDH members, however, replacement of Ser(197), a key residue for stabilizing the substrate, by glycine and alanine did not abolish the enzymatic activity of RDH10, whereas RDH10 mutants S197C, S197T and S197V completely lost their enzymatic activity. These results suggest that the size of the residue at position 197 is critical for the activity of RDH10. Mutations of the three glycine residues (Gly(43), Gly(47) and Gly(49)) in the predicted cofactor-binding motif (Gly-Xaa(3)-Gly-Xaa-Gly) of RDH10 abolished its enzymatic activity, suggesting that the cofactor-binding motif is essential for its activity. Deletion of the two hydrophobic domains dissociated RDH10 from the membrane and abolished its activity. These studies identified the key residues for the activity of RDH10 and will contribute to the further elucidation of mechanism of this important enzyme.
AQP9 is an aquaglyceroporin that serves important functions in peripheral organs, including the liver. Reflecting the lack of AQP9 knockout mice, uncertainties still prevail regarding the localization and roles of AQP9 in the central nervous system. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of AQP9 gene expression in brain, based on a quantitative and multipronged approach that includes the use of animals with targeted deletion of the AQP9 gene. We show by real-time PCR that AQP9 mRNA concentration in rat and mouse brain is approximately 3% and approximately 0.5%, respectively, of that in rat and mouse liver, the organ with the highest level of AQP9. By blue native gel analysis it could be demonstrated that the brain contains tetrameric AQP9, corresponding to the functional form of AQP9. The band corresponding to the AQP9 tetramer was absent in AQP9 knockout brain and liver. Immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization analyses with AQP9 knockout controls show that subpopulations of nigral neurons express AQP9 both at the mRNA and at the protein levels and that populations of cortical cells (including hilar neurons in the hippocampus) contain AQP9 mRNA but no detectable AQP9 immunosignal. The present data provide conclusive evidence for the presence of tetrameric AQP9 in brain and for the expression of AQP9 in neurons.
ABCG2 is best known as a multidrug transporter capable of conferring resistance to cancer cells. However, the protein is also inherently expressed in numerous barrier tissues and intriguingly within hematopoietic stem cells. Unlike its partners ABCB1 and ABCC1, there is considerably less information available on the molecular mechanism of ABCG2. The transporter has a distinct topology and is presumed to function as a homodimer. However, a number of biochemical studies have presented data to suggest that the protein adopts higher order oligomers. This review focuses on this controversial issue with particular reference to findings from low resolution structural data. In addition, a number of molecular models of ABCG2 based on high resolution structures of bacterial ABC transporters have recently become available and are critically assessed. ABCG2 is a structurally distinct member of the triumvirate of human multidrug transporters and continues to evade description of a unifying molecular mechanism.
CS (chondroitin sulfate) has been implicated in a variety of biological processes during development. Its biological functions are closely associated with characteristic sulfated structures. Here, we report the characterization of a zebrafish counterpart of C4ST-1 (chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase-1) and its functional importance in embryogenesis. Recombinant C4ST-1 showed a substrate preference for chondroitin and catalysed the 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues, a highly frequent modification of CS in the embryos of zebrafish as well as other vertebrates. Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that C4ST-1 showed a distinct spatiotemporal expression pattern in the developing zebrafish embryo. During the segmentation stages, strong expression was observed along the body axis including the notochord and somites. Functional knockdown of C4ST-1 with specific antisense morpholino-oligonucleotides led to a marked decrease in the 4-O-sulfation and amount of CS in the embryos. Consistent with the preferential expression in the rostrocaudal axis, C4ST-1 morphants displayed morphological defects exemplified by a ventrally bent trunk and a curled and/or kinky tail, largely due to misregulated myotomal myod expression, implying perturbation of axial muscle differentiation in somites. Furthermore, the aberrant projection of spinal motor axons, which extended ventrally at the interface between the notochord and individual somites, was also observed in C4ST-1 morphants. These results suggest that 4-O-sulfated CS formed by C4ST-1 is essential for somitic muscle differentiation and motor axon guidance in zebrafish development.
CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, members of the cytochrome P450 protein family, are regulated by fluid shear stress. This study describes the effects of duration, magnitude and pattern of shear stress on CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 expressions in human endothelial cells, towards the goal of understanding the role(s) of these genes in pro-atherogenic or anti-atherogenic endothelial cell functions.
ABCG2 overexpression has been linked to resistance to topoisomerase inhibitors, leading us to examine the potential interaction between ABCG2 and becatecarin.
ABCG2 is a transporter preferentially expressed in a primitive subpopulation of cells and recently reported as a surviving factor for trophoblasts. To date, manner of ABCG2 expression in lymphoid tissues is not known. Immunohistochemically, strong ABCG2 expression was found in a small proportion of plasma cells mainly located in the interfollicular space of lymphoid tissues. The number of ABCG2-high plasma cells increased in interleukin-6- (IL-6) rich lesions, such as Castleman's disease of plasma cell type. Plasma cells are subjected to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress when excess proteins are synthesized, and IL-6 stimulates protein synthesis. Therefore, the effect of IL-6 and ER stress on ABCG2 expression in plasma cells was examined. The expression level of ABCG2 increased by treatment with either IL-6 or ER stress inducers, and further increased with both. The promoter analysis revealed that the effect of IL-6 and ER stress inducers was mediated through the site overlapping XBP-1 and HIF-1 binding sequences. Knocked-down of ABCG2 by siRNA or ABCG2 inhibitor reduced plasma cell viability under ER stress. These suggest that ABCG2 is a surviving factor for plasma cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the effect of ER stress on ABCG2 expression.
CAD remains a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Comprehensive drug development programs of novel pharmacological treatment strategies frequently utilize traditional mortality/morbidity endpoints studies and additional surrogate endpoints trials. This parallel approach allows an assessment of efficacy several years in advance of the availability of data from clinical endpoint trials. Several atherosclerosis imaging markers have been introduced into these drug-development strategies, including angiography, carotid ultrasound, IVUS, MRI, and CT. This review will discuss the current status of atherosclerosis imaging as an endpoint in progression/regression trials, with an emphasis on evidence-based data. In addition to a discussion of the results of individual imaging modalities, the emerging data comparing different modalities and approaches are presented.
PIK3CA encodes the p110alpha catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, which regulates signaling pathways important for neoplasia, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Somatic mutations in this gene have been detected in several solid human tumors. We investigated these mutations in cervical carcinoma and its precursors, and their association with HPV infection and patient clinical data. The mutations were analyzed using post-PCR direct genomic DNA sequencing. Samples included 9 cervical cancer cell lines, 184 invasive cervical carcinomas, and 30 cervical neoplasias. Missense mutations of PIK3CA were identified in 15/184 (8.15%) invasive cervical carcinomas. One novel mutation G1638C (Q546H) was found. Three mutations were identified in the cervical cancer lines. No mutations were found in the precursors. The difference in mutation frequency between invasive and pre-invasive lesions was not significant (p=0.1372). In relation to age and HPV, the mutation rate was significantly higher in patients>or=60 years (p=0.001), while the rate of HPV infection was higher in patients<or=60 years (p=0.025). No significant correlation with other clinicopathological data was found. The results suggest that PIK3CA mutations are a late event and uncommon in the progression of malignant tumors, but it appears that they facilitate carcinogenesis in older women.
ABCG2 is an important member of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter shown to confer drug resistance in cancer cells. Recent studies show that an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), gefitinib, is able to modulate the function of ABCG2 and reverse ABCG2-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. Additionally, ABCG2 expression has been shown to impact treatment efficacy and development of side-effects in patients receiving gefitinib. However, it is unclear whether other EGFR TKIs interact with ABCG2 in a similar manner. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of two other EGFR TKIs, AG1478 and erlotinib, with ABCG2. Our data show that AG1478 and erlotinib potently sensitized drug-resistant cells overexpressing either wild-type or mutated ABCG2 to the ABCG2 substrate anti-cancer drugs flavopiridol and mitoxantrone. Neither AG1478 nor erlotinib sensitized ABCG2-overexpressing cells to drugs that are not substrates of ABCG2 nor did they impact drug sensitivity of parental cells. Furthermore, AG1478 and erlotinib were able to significantly enhance the intracellular accumulation of mitoxantrone in cells expressing either wild-type or mutated ABCG2. Additionally, they did not alter the protein expression of ABCG2 in the ABCG2-overexpressing cells. Taken together, we conclude that AG1478 and erlotinib potently reverse ABCG2-mediated MDR through directly inhibiting the drug efflux function of ABCG2 in the ABCG2-overexpressing cells. These results will be useful in the development of novel and more effective EGFR TKIs as well as the development of combinational chemotherapeutic strategies.
CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme that uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as a substrate to generate second messengers. Recently, CD38 was also identified as one of the main cellular NADases in mammalian tissues and appears to regulate cellular levels of NAD in multiple tissues and cells. Due to the emerging role of NAD as a key molecule in multiple signaling pathways, and metabolic conditions it is imperative to determine the cellular mechanisms that regulate the synthesis and degradation of this nucleotide. In fact, recently it has been shown that NAD participates in multiple physiological processes such as insulin secretion, control of energy metabolism, neuronal and cardiac cell survival, airway constriction, asthma, aging and longevity. The discovery of CD38 as the main cellular NADase in mammalian tissues, and the characterization of its role on the control of cellular NAD levels indicate that CD38 may serve as a pharmacological target for multiple conditions.
SLC11A1 is one of the most potent candidate genes conferring host's genetic resistance/susceptibility to various antigenically different intracellular pathogens. In this manuscript, we report the cloning and characterization of the complete coding sequence of SLC11A1 cDNA in Japanese quail. The 1680bp of cloned SLC11A1 cDNA consisted of an open reading frame of 1665bp which coded for a complete protein of 555 amino acid residues. At nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels, Japanese quail SLC11A1 exhibited 95.1 and 96.9% identity with that of chicken, respectively. However, when compared with the mammalian homologues, it exhibited 64.8-66.4% and 64.5-66.9% identity, respectively. Phylogram constructed on the basis of both nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences revealed similar pattern with the placement of Japanese quail and chicken SLC11A1 in the same clad.
ABO compatible non-identical kidney transplants are used frequently. Acquired hemolytic anemia has been reported after ABO mismatched transplantation. Patients of A, B or AB blood groups may receive organs from ABO-compatible, but non-identical donors, mostly from O blood group donors. It may also occur in patients of the AB blood group who receive a kidney from a donor of the A or B blood groups.
CYP2E1 metabolizes ethanol, generates reactive oxygen species, and is suggested to be important for development of alcoholic liver disease. The present study aims to evaluate the role of CYP2E1 in combination with ethanol for development of alcoholic liver disease using mice transgenic for the human CYP2E1 gene.
CYP2C19 polymorphisms have been inconsistently reported to associate with the efficacy of proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapies for eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether CYP2C19 polymorphism affect H. pylori eradication rates obtained with first-line PPI-based triple therapies.
ACSL4 is a gene involved in non-syndromic X-linked mental retardation. It encodes for a ubiquitous protein that adds coenzyme A to long-chain fatty acids, with a high substrate preference for arachidonic acid. It presents also a brain-specific isoform deriving from an alternative splicing and containing 41 additional N-terminal amino acids. To start to unravelling the link between ACSL4 and mental retardation, we have performed molecular and cell biological studies. By retro-transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses we identified a new transcript with a shorter 5'-UTR region. By immunofluorescence microscopy in embryonic rat hippocampal neurons we report that ACSL4 is associated preferentially to endoplasmic reticulum tubules. ACSL4 knockdown by siRNAs in hippocampal neurons indicated that this protein is largely dispensable for these cells' gross architectural features (i.e. axonal and dendritic formation and final length) yet it is required for the presence of normal spines. In fact, reduced levels of ACSL4 led to a significant reduction in dendritic spine density and an alteration in spine/filopodia distribution. The possible mechanisms behind this phenotype are discussed.
PC is made via the CDP-choline pathway, in which CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase alpha (CTalpha), encoded by Pcyt1a, is the rate-limiting enzyme whose mRNA expression is strictly regulated. Previously, we reported that Ets1 enhanced and Net repressed CTalpha transcription by binding at the Ets binding site (-49/-47) in the Pcyt1a promoter. In this study, we asked if an Ets1 analogue, Ets2, also regulates CTalpha transcription and investigated the importance of its nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES). Ets2 is primarily detected in the nucleus. Various mutated Ets2 proteins fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein were constructed to identify the NLS and NES in Ets2. Mutation of Ets2 at amino acids 404-410 results in a protein that is evenly distributed in the cell. Interestingly, an Ets2 protein deleted at the C-terminus (amino acids 1-392 present) was localized to the cytoplasm and site-specific mutation in the region 364-372 of this construct resulted in cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. These results suggest that the NLS in Ets2 is between amino acids 404 and 410, and that the NES is between amino acids 364 and 372. Ets2 enhanced, but the mutant forms of Ets2 had little effects on the transcription of a CTalpha-reporter construct. When RAW264 cells, murine macrophage cell-line, were stimulated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or macrophage-colony stimulating factor, the transcription of CTalpha was enhanced accompanied by increased mRNA of Ets2. These results suggest that the induction of Ets2 is important for CTalpha transcription by TPA and macrophage-colony stimulating factor.
CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with multiple functions. It acts as an ecto-enzyme as well as a receptor. The enzymatic activity catalyzes the formation of two potent Ca(2+) releasing agents: cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR) from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) from NAD phosphate (NADP). The receptor function of CD38 leads to the phosphorylation of intracellular signaling proteins and the up-regulation of cytokine production in immune cells. These two functions of CD38 underlie its involvement in various biological processes, such as hormone secretion, immune cell differentiation, and immune responses. Clinically, CD38 is used as a negative prognosis marker for chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL). However, a clear molecular understanding of CD38's role in physiology and pathology is still lacking. To facilitate the study of CD38 at cellular and molecular levels, here we report a mechanism-based method for fluorescently labeling CD38 on live cells. This labeling method does not interfere with the receptor function of CD38 and the downstream signaling. The labeling method is thus a useful tool to study the receptor function of CD38 in live cells. In addition, since the mechanism-based labeling also inhibits the enzymatic activity of CD38, it should be useful for dissecting the receptor function of CD38 without interference from its enzyme function in complicated biological processes.
CYP21A2 mutations resulting from microconversions of the CYP21A1P sequence in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) commonly appear in all populations. However, it has not often been described as being due to the gene founder effect. Herein, we investigated two spontaneous mutations of IVS2+1G>A and R316X in ethnic Chinese (Taiwanese) CAH patients to determine whether they share the same haplotype of ancient origin by the analysis of sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) for HLA class I B and sequence-based typing (SBT) for HLA class II DRB1 gene-typing methods. From over 200 CAH families, eight unrelated CAH patients were found and examined: five had the IVS2+1G>A mutation and three had the R316X mutation. Based on HLA typing data, five alleles in five patients with the IVS2+1G>A mutation were consistent with a shared haplotype of the B *3909-DRB1 *160201 allele, and the three alleles in the three patients with the R316X mutation were all the B *460101-DRB1 *080302 allele. The evidence indicates that the haplotype of single-base substitutions of either the IVS2+1G>A or R316X mutation came from the same allele rather than a mutational hot spot, suggesting that the gene founder effect has occurred in the Taiwanese population. This is the first report of the gene founder effect of the CYP21A2 mutation occurring in ethnic Chinese (Taiwanese) CAH patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
ABCA1 plays a major role in HDL metabolism. Cholesterol secretion by ABCA1 is dependent on the presence of extracellular acceptors, such as lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). However, the importance of the direct interaction between apoA-I and ABCA1 in HDL formation remains unclear. In contrast, ABCB4 mediates the secretion of phospholipids and cholesterol in the presence of sodium taurocholate (NaTC) but not in the presence of apoA-I. In this study, we analyzed apoA-I binding and NaTC-dependent lipid efflux by ABCA1. ABCA1 mediated the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids in the presence of NaTC as well as in the presence of apoA-I in an ATP-dependent manner. The Tangier disease mutation W590S, which resides in the extracellular domain and impairs apoA-I-dependent lipid efflux, greatly decreased NaTC-dependent cholesterol and phospholipid efflux. However, the W590S mutation did not impair apoA-I binding and, conversely, retarded the dissociation of apoA-I from ABCA1. These results suggest that the W590S mutation impairs ATP-dependent lipid translocation and that lipid translocation or possibly lipid loading, facilitates apoA-I dissociation from ABCA1. NaTC is a good tool for analyzing ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux and allows dissection of the steps of HDL formation by ABCA1.
CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 enzymes metabolize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to the reactive oxyderivatives. PAHs can induce the activity of both enzymes, which increases its conversion and enhances risk of carcinogenesis. Thus, the inhibition of CYP enzymes is recognized as a cancer chemoprevention strategy. A well-known group of chemopreventive agents is isothiocyanates, which occur naturally in Brassica vegetables. In this paper, a naturally occurring sulforaphane and its two synthetic analogues isothiocyanate-2-oxohexyl and alyssin were investigated. The aim of the study was to determine whether the differences in the isothiocyanate structure change its ability to inhibit CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 activity induced by benzo[a]pyrene in HepG2 and Mcf7 cells. Also a mechanistic study was performed including isothiocyanates' influence on CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 catalytic activity, enzymatic protein level, and AhR translocation. It was shown that both enzymes were significantly induced by benzo[a]pyrene, and isothiocyanates were capable of decreasing the induced activity. The inhibitory properties depend on the types of isothiocyanate and enzyme. In general, CYP1A2 was altered in the more meaningful way than CYP1A1 by isothiocyanates. Sulforaphane exhibited weak inhibitory properties, whereas both analogues were capable of inhibiting BaP-induced activity with the similar efficacy. The mechanistic study revealed that analogues decreased the CYP1A2 activity via the protein-level reduction and CYP1A1 directly. The results indicate that isothiocyanates can be considered as potent chemopreventive substances and the change in the sulforaphane structure increases its chemopreventive potency.
PTEN and SHP1 are tumor suppressor genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle control and apoptosis. The authors investigated the protein expression of PTEN and SHP1, by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays from bone marrow samples in children, diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and nonmalignant controls. PTEN was overexpressed in diagnostic ALL samples, while SHP1 showed a low expression. Both proteins showed a significant difference in expression compared to nonmalignant controls. The roles of PTEN and SHP1 are not well investigated in pediatric leukemia and could in the future play a role as prognostic factors.
PTEN is a critical tumor suppressor gene mutated frequently in various human cancers. Previous studies have showed that PTEN mRNA expression is down-regulated by TGF-beta1 in various cell lines. In present study, we have found that TGF-beta1 down-regulates PTEN mRNA and protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner in hepatocarcinoma cell line SMMC-7721. Based on the PTEN promoter dual-luciferase report assay, we have found that PTEN transcription is not affected by TGF-beta1. By using transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (Act D), the turnover rate of PTEN transcripts appeared to be accelerated during TGF-beta1 stimulation, which indicated that down-regulation of PTEN by TGF-beta1 was post-transcriptional. What interested us was that transfection of PTEN coding sequence increased TGF-beta1-induced degradation of PTEN mRNA, suggesting that PTEN coding region was account for TGF-beta1-mediated down-regulation of PTEN. In addition, TGF-beta1 down-regulated PTEN expression was blocked by the TbetaIR inhibitor SB431542 and the p38 inhibitor SB203580, suggesting Smad and p38 MAPK signal pathways played crucial roles in PTEN down-regulation via TGF-beta1 stimulation. In this study, we also found TGF-beta1 accelerated down-regulation of PTEN through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Collectively, our data clearly demonstrated that TGF-beta1-mediated down-regulation of PTEN was post-transcriptional and post-translational, depending on its coding sequence, Smad and p38-MAPK signal pathways were involved in this down-regulation.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) is a lipid phosphatase that counteracts the function of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K). Loss of function of PTEN results in constitutive activation of AKT and downstream effectors and correlates with many human cancers, as well as various brain disorders, including macrocephaly, seizures, Lhermitte-Duclos disease, and autism. We previously generated a conditional Pten knock-out mouse line with Pten loss in limited postmitotic neurons in the cortex and hippocampus. Pten-null neurons developed neuronal hypertrophy and loss of neuronal polarity. The mutant mice exhibited macrocephaly and behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of certain features of human autism. Here, we report that rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), can prevent and reverse neuronal hypertrophy, resulting in the amelioration of a subset of PTEN-associated abnormal behaviors, providing evidence that the mTORC1 pathway downstream of PTEN is critical for this complex phenotype.
SUV39H1 is a histone H3K9-specific methyltransferase important for heterochromatin formation, regulation of gene expression, and induction of senescence in premalignant cells. SUV39H1 forms a complex with SirT1, and its activity is stimulated by SirT1 binding. Here we present evidence that the product of the DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) gene disrupts the SUV39H1-SirT1 complex. Furthermore, DBC1 binds to the SUV39H1 catalytic domain and inhibits its ability to methylate histone H3 in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of endogenous DBC1 increased the level of cellular H3K9 methylation. As expected, DBC1 also binds to SirT1 and inhibits the deacetylase activity of SirT1. These results identify DBC1 as a novel cellular inhibitor of SUV39H1 activity. DBC1 may be an important regulator of heterochromatin formation and genomic stability by disrupting the SUV39H1-SirT1 complex and inactivating both enzymes.
ABCA4 is a member of the ABCA subfamily of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters that is expressed in rod and cone photoreceptors of the vertebrate retina. ABCA4, also known as the Rim protein and ABCR, is a large 2,273 amino acid glycoprotein organized as two tandem halves, each containing a single membrane spanning segment followed sequentially by a large exocytoplasmic domain, a multispanning membrane domain and a nucleotide binding domain. Over 500 mutations in the gene encoding ABCA4 are associated with a spectrum of related autosomal recessive retinal degenerative diseases including Stargardt macular degeneration, cone-rod dystrophy and a subset of retinitis pigmentosa. Biochemical studies on the purified ABCA4 together with analysis of abca4 knockout mice and patients with Stargardt disease have implicated ABCA4 as a retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine transporter that facilitates the removal of potentially reactive retinal derivatives from photoreceptors following photoexcitation. Knowledge of the genetic and molecular basis for ABCA4 related retinal degenerative diseases is being used to develop rationale therapeutic treatments for this set of disorders.
PIK3CA codes for the p110alpha isoform of class-IA PI 3-kinase and oncogenic mutations in the helical domain and kinase domain are common in several cancers. We studied the biochemical properties of a common helical domain mutant (E545K) and a common kinase domain mutant (H1047R). Both retain the ability to autophosphorylate Ser608 of p85alpha and are also inhibited by a range of PI 3-kinase inhibitors (Wortmannin, LY294002, PI-103 and PIK-75) to a similar extent as WT p110alpha. Both mutants display an increased V(max) but while a PDGF derived diphosphotyrosylpeptide caused an increase in V(max) for WT p85alpha/p110alpha it did not for the E545K variant and actually decreased V(max) for the H1047R variant. Further, the E545K mutant was activated by H-Ras whereas the H1047R mutant was not. Together these results suggest helical domain mutants are in a state mimicking activation by growth factors whereas kinase domain mutants mimic the state activated by H-Ras.
PIK3CA mutation and subsequent activation of the AKT pathway play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. However, little is known about the prognostic role of PIK3CA mutation in colon cancer.
ABCB1 haplotypes were determined in 534 healthy Finnish volunteers, of whom 24 participated in a pharmacokinetic study on simvastatin and atorvastatin. The frequencies of occurrence of haplotypes c.1236T-c.2677T-c.3435T and c.1236C-c.2677G-c.3435C were 42.7 and 34.4%, respectively. The simvastatin acid AUC(0-12h) was 60% larger, the atorvastatin AUC(0-infinity) 55% larger, and the atorvastatin half-life 24% longer in subjects with the ABCB1 TTT/TTT genotype (n = 12) than in those with the CGC/CGC genotype (n = 12) (P < 0.05), but there were no differences between the two genotypes with respect to the pharmacokinetics of the lactones of these drugs.
IDH1 encodes isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, which participates in the citric acid cycle and was recently reported to be mutated in 12% of glioblastomas. We assessed IDH1 mutations in 321 gliomas of various histological types and biological behaviors. A total of 130 IDH1 mutations was detected, and all were located at amino acid residue 132. Of these, 91% were G-->A mutations (Arg-->His). IDH1 mutations were frequent in low-grade diffuse astrocytomas (88%) and in secondary glioblastomas that developed through progression from low-grade diffuse or anaplastic astrocytoma (82%). Similarly, high frequencies of IDH1 mutations were found in oligodendrogliomas (79%) and oligoastrocytomas (94%). Analyses of multiple biopsies from the same patient (51 cases) showed that there were no cases in which an IDH1 mutation occurred after the acquisition of either a TP53 mutation or loss of 1p/19q, suggesting that IDH1 mutations are very early events in gliomagenesis and may affect a common glial precursor cell population. IDH1 mutations were co-present with TP53 mutations in 63% of low-grade diffuse astrocytomas and with loss of heterozygosity 1p/19q in 64% of oligodendrogliomas; they were rare in pilocytic astrocytomas (10%) and primary glioblastomas (5%) and absent in ependymomas. The frequent presence of IDH1 mutations in secondary glioblastomas and their near-complete absence in primary glioblastomas reinforce the concept that despite their histological similarities, these subtypes are genetically and clinically distinct entities.
PNP catalyzes a reversible phosphorolysis of purine deoxy- and ribonucleosides with formation of (d)Rib-1-P and appropriate bases. PNP plays a leading role in the cell metabolism of nucleosides and nucleotides, as well as in maintaining the immune status of an organism. The major purpose of the majority of studies on the PNP is the detection of high-performance enzyme inhibitors, derivatives of the purine nucleosides, which are used in medicine as immunosuppressors. It is well known that the latter are necessary for creating a selective T-cell immunodeficiency in a human body under organs and tissue transplantation. The review discusses the issues related to deliberate synthesis of effective, metabolically inert, and low-toxic PNP inhibitors. It also analyzes the available studies on substrate and inhibitory properties of the analogues of purine nucleosides, as well as research on the structural factors which reinforce the inhibitor activity of those analogues. The inhibitors which are either used in medical practice or are currently at a stage of preclinical testing are described. The inhibitors which are more efficient in their influence on the PNF from tumorous tissues are of special interest. Using PNP inhibitors in case of a number of pathologies denotes the importance and promise of research on both the enzyme and the compounds affecting its activity.
"KCNJ11 null mutants, lacking Kir6.2 ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels, exhibit a marked susceptibility towards hypertension (HTN)-induced heart failure. To gain insight into the molecular alterations induced by knockout of this metabolic sensor under hemodynamic stress, wild-type (WT) and Kir6.2 knockout (Kir6.2-KO) cardiac proteomes were profiled by comparative 2-DE and Orbitrap MS. Despite equivalent systemic HTN produced by chronic hyperaldosteronism, 114 unique proteins were altered in Kir6.2-KO compared to WT hearts. Bioinformatic analysis linked the primary biological function of the K(ATP) channel-dependent protein cohort to energetic metabolism (64% of proteins), followed by signaling infrastructure (36%) including oxidoreductases, stress-related chaperones, processes supporting protein degradation, transcription and translation, and cytostructure. Mapped protein-protein relationships authenticated the primary impact on metabolic pathways, delineating the K(ATP) channel-dependent subproteome within a nonstochastic network. Iterative systems interrogation of the proteomic web prioritized heart-specific adverse effects, i.e., ""Cardiac Damage"", ""Cardiac Enlargement"", and ""Cardiac Fibrosis"", exposing a predisposition for the development of cardiomyopathic traits in the hypertensive Kir6.2-KO. Validating this maladaptive forecast, phenotyping documented an aggravated myocardial contractile performance, a massive interstitial fibrosis and an exaggerated left ventricular size, all prognostic indices of poor outcome. Thus, Kir6.2 ablation engenders unfavorable proteomic remodeling in hypertensive hearts, providing a composite molecular substrate for pathologic stress-associated cardiovascular disease."
ABCA1 plays a major role in cholesterol homeostasis and high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism. ABCA1 contains disulfide bond(s) between its N- and C-terminal halves, but it remains unclear whether disulfide bond formation is important for the functions of ABCA1 and which cysteines are involved in disulfide bond formation. To answer these questions, we constructed >30 ABCA1 mutants in which 16 extracellular domain (ECD) cysteines were replaced with serines and examined disulfide bond formation, apoA-I binding, and HDL formation in these mutants. From the single cysteine replacements, two cysteines (Cys(75) and Cys(309)) in ECD1 were found to be essential for apoA-I binding. In contrast, in ECD2, only Cys(1477) was found to be essential for HDL formation, and no single cysteine replacement impaired apoA-I binding. The concurrent replacement of two cysteines, Cys(1463) and Cys(1465), impaired apoA-I binding and HDL formation, suggesting that four of five extracellular cysteines (Cys(75), Cys(309), Cys(1463), Cys(1465), and Cys(1477)) are involved in these functions of ABCA1. Trypsin digestion experiments suggested that one disulfide bond is not sufficient and that two intramolecular disulfide bonds (between Cys(75) and Cys(309) in ECD1 and either Cys(1463) or Cys(1465) and Cys(1477) in ECD2) are required for ABCA1 to be fully functional.
CD36 has been shown to associate with non-receptor Src kinases to activate mitogen-activated protein kinases and trigger cytoskeletal remodelling, important events in foam cell formation and macrophage migration. Yet, its role in regulating circulating mononuclear phagocyte trafficking to atherosclerotic lesions has not been investigated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of CD36 in modulating the recruitment of mononuclear phagocytes to the arterial wall and the associated vascular inflammation, using both pharmacological and genetic approaches.
CYP17A1 is currently a target for total androgen blockade in advanced prostate cancer (CaP) patients. After castration, or removal of testicular androgens, CYP17A1 can act as a rate-limiting enzyme in androgen synthesis from cholesterol or other adrenal precursors within the tumor microenvironment ultimately contributing to disease progression. Herein we provide evidence that CYP17A1 could also be a mediator of cell-to-cell communication within the CaP tumor microenvironment.
CBS domains are small protein motifs, usually associated in tandems, that are involved in binding to adenosyl groups. In humans, several genetic diseases have been associated with mutations in CBS domains, and then, they can be considered as promising targets for the rational design of new drugs. However, there are no structural studies describing their oligomerization states, conformational preferences, and stability. In this work, the oligomerization state, the stability, and conformational properties of the CBS domain protein MJ0729 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii were explored by using a combination of hydrodynamic (namely, ultracentrifugation, DLS, DOSY-NMR, and gel filtration) and spectroscopic techniques (fluorescence, circular dichroism, NMR, and FTIR). The results indicate that the protein had a pH-dependent oligomerization equilibrium: at pH 7, the dominant species is a dimer, where each monomer is a two-CBS domain protein, and at pH 4.5-4.8, the dominant species is a tetramer, with an oblong shape, as shown by X-ray. Deconvolution of the FTIR spectra indicates that the monomer at physiological pH has 26% alpha-helical structure and 17% beta-sheet, with most of the structure disordered. These results are similar to the percentages of secondary structure of the monomer in the resolved tetrameric X-ray structure (21% of alpha-helical structure and 7% of beta-sheet). At pH 2.5, there was a decrease in the level of secondary structure of the monomer, and formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, as shown by FTIR, suggesting the presence of high-molecular weight species. The physiological dimeric species is thermal and chemically very stable with a thermal midpoint of approximately 99 degrees C, as shown by both DSC and FTIR; the GdmCl chemical midpoint of the dimeric species occurs in a single step and was greater than 4 M.
CAD (charged aerosol detector) has recently become a new alternative detection system in HPLC. This detection approach was applied in a new HPLC method for the determination of three of the major statins used in clinical treatment-simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin. The method was optimized and the influence of individual parameters on CAD response and sensitivity was carefully studied. Chromatography was performed on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB C18 (4.6 mm x 75 mm, 3.5 microm), using acetonitrile and formic acid 0.1% as mobile phase. The detection was performed using both CAD (20 pA range) and DAD (diode array detector-238 nm) simultaneously connected in series. In terms of linearity, precision and accuracy, the method was validated using tablets containing atorvastatin and simvastatin. The CAD is designated to be a non-linear detector in a wide dynamic range, however, in this application and in the tested concentration range its response was found to be perfectly linear. The limits of quantitation (0.1 microg/ml) were found to be two times lower than those of UV detection.
ACE inhibition is now recognized as superior to placebo on outcomes in stable coronary artery disease (CAD), including total and cardiovascular mortality, fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure, revascularization and stroke. This review examines clinical evidence for the mode of action of ACE inhibitors in CAD, which is dominated by the results of a single trial, EUROPA, and its substudies. The generally accepted mode of action for ACE inhibitors in CAD is blood pressure reduction. However, the EUROPA data demonstrate that endothelial protection, with the effect of arresting or reducing the processes of atherosclerosis is also important. Chronic overexpression of tissue ACE in CAD disrupts the angiotensin II/bradykinin balance with a net result of endothelial dysfunction. ACE inhibitors reduce production of angiotensin II, which prevents vasoconstriction, reduces adhesion molecules and growth factors, decreases oxidative stress and prevents apoptosis. A concomitant decrease in the degradation of bradykinin as a result of ACE inhibition raises levels of this kinin, leading to vasodilation and an antiapoptotic action, as well as opposition of the negative actions of angiotensin II. We now have clinical trial evidence of these processes in CAD patients participating in the EUROPA study by measurement of markers of endothelial function, including nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), the rate of apoptosis and levels of von Willebrand factor (vWf). Serum from CAD patients was found to significantly downregulate eNOS protein expression and activity versus that of healthy controls (p < 0.01), most probably as a result of upregulation of tissue ACE. One year of treatment with perindopril upregulated eNOS protein expression and activity (19% and 27% vs placebo; p < 0.05). Similarly, vWf was elevated at baseline and significantly reduced after 1 year of treatment with perindopril (p < 0.001). Increased endothelial apoptosis by serum of CAD patients was accompanied by excess angiotensin II and tumour necrosis factor-alpha and a reduction in bradykinin; all of these parameters were reversed by treatment. We therefore have clinical results showing that perindopril normalizes the angiotensin II/bradykinin balance, reduces inflammation and prevents endothelial apoptosis. Accumulating preclinical evidence for the absence of a class effect for ACE inhibitors includes differences in terms of effect on eNOS and rate of endothelial apoptosis. These differences appear to be related to tissue affinity, penetration of atherosclerotic plaque and affinity for the target enzyme. Consideration of these features is important when administering ACE inhibition as secondary prevention in CAD patients. In this context, current European guidelines for stable angina pectoris recommend prescription of agents and doses with proven efficacy in secondary prevention.
CYP1B1 is a key enzyme involved in estrogen metabolism and may play an important role in the development and progression of breast cancer. In a population-based case-control study, we examined eight CYP1B1 haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms in relation to invasive breast cancer risk. Analyses were based on 1,655 cases and 1,470 controls; all women were Caucasian. Among the individual single nucleotide polymorphisms, one (rs9341266) was associated with increased risk of breast cancer (P(trend) = 0.021), although the association was no longer significant after adjusting for multiple tests. A marginally significant haplotype effect was identified (P(global) = 0.015), with significant associations identified for 2 uncommon haplotypes comprising 4% of the controls. Results suggest that genetic variation in CYP1B1 has at most a minor influence on breast cancer susceptibility among Caucasian women.
MVD of the left rostral ventrolateral medulla oblongata may be an effective treatment for patients suffering from intractable severe systemic blood hypertension. This article presents a literature review. Further clinical controlled studies have to be conducted to define precise indications.
ABCC3 (MRP3) is a member of the family of multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP), which belong to the largest family of membrane transport proteins, namely, the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Members of this family contribute to the excretion of several organic anions from cells and play a critical role in conferring resistance against drugs used in the treatment of cancer. The overexpression of ABCC3 in the yeast Pichia pastoris and its subsequent purification made possible the study of substrate-dependent ATPase activity [Chloupkova, M., et al. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 7992-8003]. Here we describe the successful reconstitution of purified ABCC3 in proteoliposomes and ABCC3-dependent uptake of the anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX), as well as the physiological substrate leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)). Our results show specific transport in a cell-free environment and in the absence of other proteins, revealing positive allosteric cooperativity for ABCC3-mediated substrate translocation. The ABCC3-mediated transport of MTX indicates a Hill coefficient of 2.3 +/- 1.7, a maximum transport rate (V(max)) of >2 micromol min(-1) mg(-1), and a K(M) in the millimolar range, whereas the translocation of LTC(4) into proteoliposomes displayed a Hill coefficient of 2.3 +/- 0.5 with a maximum transport rate of 4.7 +/- 0.8 nmol min(-1) mg(-1), and a K(M) in the micromolar range (1.7 +/- 0.3 microM). The transport of both substrates, MTX and LTC(4), was inhibited by etoposide, confirming a higher affinity of ABCC3 for LTC(4) than for MTX. The technical advances described in this report represent the basis for the extended and detailed kinetic characterization of ABCC3 with a wide range of implications for the investigation of other human ABC transporters.
UGT1A7 is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of (pre)carcinogens present in tobacco smoke. We investigated whether genetic polymorphisms in UGT1A7, with predicted altered enzyme activity, may have a risk-modifying effect on head and neck carcinogenesis.
CYP2A6 gene encodes the principal enzyme involved in the metabolism of many drugs including artesunate. We developed a simplified duplex nested PCR method for the detection of the CYP2A61B, CYP2A62, CYP2A64, CYP2A67, CYP2A68 and CYP2A69 variant alleles highly prevalent among Malaysian population.
CYP4A11 transgenic mice (CYP4A11 Tg) were generated to examine in vivo regulation of the human CYP4A11 gene. Expression of CYP4A11 in mice yields liver and kidney P450 4A11 levels similar to those found in the corresponding human tissues and leads to an increased microsomal capacity for omega-hydroxylation of lauric acid. Fasted CYP4A11 Tg mice exhibit 2-3-fold increases in hepatic CYP4A11 mRNA and protein, and this response is absent in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) null mice. Dietary administration of either of the PPARalpha agonists, fenofibrate or clofibric acid, increases hepatic and renal CYP4A11 levels by 2-3-fold, and these responses were also abrogated in PPARalpha null mice. Basal liver CYP4A11 levels are reduced differentially in PPARalpha-/- females (>95%) and males (<50%) compared with PPARalpha-/+ mice. Quantitative and temporal differences in growth hormone secretion are known to alter hepatic lipid metabolism and to underlie sexually dimorphic gene expression, respectively. Continuous infusion of low levels of growth hormone reduced CYP4A11 expression by 50% in PPARalpha-proficient male and female transgenic mice. A larger decrease was observed for the expression of CYP4A11 in PPARalpha-/- CYP4A11 Tg male mice to levels similar to that of female PPARalpha-deficient mice. These results suggest that PPARalpha contributes to the maintenance of basal CYP4A11 expression and mediates CYP4A11 induction in response to fibrates or fasting. In contrast, increased exposure to growth hormone down-regulates CYP4A11 expression in liver.
ABO blood group compatibility between donors and recipients of heart transplants is required to reduce the risk of hyperacute rejection. Ideally, ABO-identical cardiac grafts should be used but transplantating using ABO compatible types allows reduced waiting times among recipients with rarer types without a significant increase in hyperacute rejection. However, previous reports have indicated that use of donors with minor ABO mismatches may adversely influence late outcomes, although more recent studies do not confirm this suggestion. Our purpose was to analyze this practice in our center.
CYP2C9 is a major liver enzyme responsible of the metabolism of many clinically important drugs. The presence of CYP2C9 genetic polymorphisms has been associated with marked interindividual variability in its catalytic activity that could result in drug toxicity. Here we present frequencies of the most common CYP2C9 coding variants CYP2C9*2 (C430T) and CYP2C9*3 (A1075C) in representative samples of four regions from Spain (Basque Country, n=358; Catalonia, n=240; Central Spain, n=190 and Galicia, n=288) and one northern Italian region, (Verona, n=164), which range between 0.125 and 0.165 in the case of CYP2C9*2 and between 0.071 and 0.085 for CYP2C9*3. No significant differences between CYP2C9 allele frequencies were found comparing all the sampled populations. A more extensive comparative analysis using allele frequency data of populations widely spread over Europe was performed, showing significant differences in the CYP2C9*2 allele frequencies distribution between some of the regions, being quite homogeneous in the case of CYP2C9*3 variant. The results obtained show that above 40% of our samples carry a mutate allele, which can result in a poor metabolization of low therapeutic index drugs as oral anticoagulants (warfarin, acenocoumarol), oral antidiabetic drugs and some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Our study constitutes both a large (n=1240) and robust allele frequency database on CYP2C9 polymorphisms, which represents one of the most numerous CYP2C9*2 and *3 database existing to date.
ABCC2 (MRP2) and ABCG2 (BCRP) transport various endogenous and exogenous compounds, including many anticancer drugs, into bile, feces, and urine. We investigated the possibly overlapping roles of Abcg2 and Abcc2 in the elimination of the anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX) and its toxic metabolite 7-hydroxymethotrexate (7OH-MTX).
CD38 and CD49d are associated negative prognosticators in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Despite evidence that both molecules are involved in interactions occurring between CLL and normal cells in the context of CLL-involved tissues, a functional link is still missing. Using gene expression profiles comparing CD38(+)CD49d(+) versus CD38(-)CD49d(-) CLL cells, we showed overexpression of the CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines in cells from the former group. These chemokines were also up-regulated by CD38 signals in CLL; moreover, CCL3 was expressed by CLL cells from bone marrow biopsies (BMB) of CD38(+)CD49d(+) but not CD38(-)CD49d(-) cases. High levels of CCR1 and, to a lesser extent, CCR5, the receptors for CCL3 and CCL4, were found in CLL-derived monocyte-macrophages. Consistently, CCL3 increased monocyte migration, and CD68(+) macrophage infiltration was particularly high in BMB from CD38(+)CD49d(+) CLL. Conditioned media from CCL3-stimulated macrophages induced endothelial cells to express vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), the CD49d ligand, likely through tumor necrosis factor alpha overproduction. These effects were apparent in BMB from CD38(+)CD49d(+) CLL, where lymphoid infiltrates were characterized by a prominent meshwork of VCAM-1(+) stromal/endothelial cells. Lastly, CD49d engagement by VCAM-1 transfectants increased viability of CD38(+)CD49d(+) CLL cells. Altogether, CD38 and CD49d can be thought of as parts of a consecutive chain of events ultimately leading to improved survival of CLL cells.
ABCB1 is a human ABC transporter originally characterized by its ability to cause resistance to chemotherapy drugs in cancer cells, and later found to be functionally expressed in human neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in vitro. Here, we performed a detailed examination of ABCB1's expression on human NSPCs in vitro and in human fetal brain tissues, and analyzed the cellular properties of the human NSPCs expressing ABCB1. We confirmed that ABCB1 was expressed on the surface of human NSPCs, and its level correlated well with those of Nestin and CD133. The population of fluorescence-activated cell sorter-sorted human NSPCs expressing high levels of ABCB1 showed enrichment of proliferating cells, higher expression of 246 genes (e.g., RGS6, IGFBP7, GFAP, TNC, Hes1), and lower expression of 71 genes (e.g., STMN2, DLX5, BASP1, DCX, CD24) compared with human NSPCs expressing low or no ABCB1. In situ, ABCB1 was selectively expressed in cells in the ventricular or subventricular regions of lateral ventricles that expressed Nestin in human development. These findings suggest that ABCB1 is predominantly expressed in immature human fetal NSPCs in vitro and at early developmental stages in vivo, and that it may be a useful marker for human NSPCs.
ABCC1 and ABCG2 are ubiquitous ATP-binding cassette transmembrane proteins that play an important role in multidrug resistance (MDR). In this study, we evaluated the possible interaction of vandetanib, an orally administered drug inhibiting multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, with ABCC1 and ABCG2 in vitro.
PTEN haploinsufficiency is common in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, though the incidence of genomic deletion and its downstream effects have not been elucidated in clinical samples of hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). Progression to androgen independence is pivotal in prostate cancer and mediated largely by the androgen receptor (AR). Since this process is distinct from metastatic progression, we examined alterations of the PTEN gene in locally advanced recurrent, non-metastatic human HRPC tissues. Retrospective analyses of PTEN deletion status were correlated with activated downstream phospho-Akt (p-Akt) pathway proteins and with the androgen receptor. The prevalence of PTEN genomic deletions in transurethral resection samples of 59 HRPC patients with known clinical outcome was assessed by four-colour FISH analyses. FISH was performed using six BAC clones spanning both flanking PTEN genomic regions and the PTEN gene locus, and a chromosome 10 centromeric probe. PTEN copy number was also evaluated in a subset of cases using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. In addition, the samples were immunostained with antibodies against p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-70S6, and AR. The PTEN gene was deleted in 77% of cases, with 25% showing homozygous deletions, 18% homozygous and hemizygous deletions, and 34% hemizygous deletions only. In a subset of the study group, SNP array analysis confirmed the FISH findings. PTEN genomic deletion was significantly correlated to the expression of downstream p-Akt (p < 0.0001), AR (p = 0.025), and to cancer-specific mortality (p = 0.039). PTEN deletion is common in HRPC, with bi-allelic loss correlating to disease-specific mortality and associated with Akt and AR deregulation.
ABCG2 is an ATP-binding cassette half-transporter initially identified in multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines and recently suggested to play an important role in pharmacokinetics. Here we report studies of a conserved arginine predicted to localize near the cytoplasmic side of TM1. First, we determined the effect of losing charge and bulk at this position via substitutions with glycine and alanine. The R383G mutant when transfected into HEK cells was not detectable on immunoblot or by functional assay, while the R383A mutant exhibited detectable but significantly decreased levels compared to wild-type, partial retention in the ER and altered glycosylation. Efflux of the ABCG2-substrates mitoxantrone and pheophorbide a was observed. Our experiments suggested rapid degradation of the R383A mutant by the proteasome via a kifunensine-insensitive pathway. Interestingly, overnight treatment of the R383A mutant with mitoxantrone assisted in protein maturation as evidenced by a shift to the N-glycosylated form. The R383A mutant when expressed in insect cells, though detected on the surface, had no measurable ATPase activity. In addition, substitution with the positively charged lysine resulted in significantly decreased protein expression levels in HEK cells, while retaining function. In conclusion, arginine 383 is a crucial residue for ABCG2 biogenesis, where even the most conservative mutations have a large impact.
CD36 is a receptor that occurs on the surface of activated immune cells, vascular endothelial cells and participates in phagocytosis and lipid metabolism. CD36 is known to be the major endothelial receptor molecule for field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum. A T1264G mutation in exon X of the gene leads to deficiency of CD36. This study aimed at determining associations between CD36 deficiency, P. falciparum in vitro adherence on purified CD36 and anaemia among children in an endemic area.
CYP3A4 is the most abundant xenobiotic-metabolizing cytochrome P450 isoform. We examined the structural features of the CYP3A4 molecule with regard to ligand access.
HADH encodes for the enzyme 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (HADH) and catalyses the penultimate reaction in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. All previously reported patients with mutations in HADH gene and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH) showed raised plasma hydroxybutyrylcarnitine and urinary 3-hydroxyglutarate.
CD38 expression on CD8+ T lymphocytes in HIV-infected patients is monitored by flow cytometry (FCM). There is however no consensus re CD38 protocols, analyses or result reporting within/between laboratories. Internal quality control measures (QC) were established for a standardized CD38 protocol and a system proposed for reporting CD38 fluctuation in longitudinal HIV+ patient monitoring.
"GPX1 encoding the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) and hOGG1 encoding the 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (OGG1) may counteract oxidative stress and resulting DNA damage associated with lifestyle-related exposures. We examined whether the polymorphisms GPX1 Pro(198)Leu and OGG1 Ser(326)Cys or low erythrocyte GPX enzyme activity in pre-diagnostic blood samples are associated with colorectal cancer risk, and assessed possible interactions between the polymorphisms or enzyme activity and various lifestyle factors in relation to colorectal cancer risk. Additionally, we studied whether the GPX1 Pro(198)Leu polymorphism and several lifestyle factors predict GPX activity in erythrocytes. The present study was nested within the prospective ""Diet, Cancer and Health"" study of 57,053 Danes including 375 colorectal cancer cases and a comparison group of 779 individuals matched on gender. Biomaterial was sampled and information on lifestyle factors was obtained from questionnaires filled in at enrolment in 1993-1997. GPX1 Pro(198)Leu, hOGG1 Ser(326)Cys and erythrocyte GPX enzyme activity were not associated with risk of colorectal cancer. We observed a higher risk associated with alcohol consumption and smoking among homozygous GPX1(198)Leu carriers, with incidence rate ratios for colorectal cancer of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.17-1.81, P=0.02) per 10g alcohol intake per day and 2.56 (95% CI: 0.99-6.61, P=0.02) among ever smokers compared with never smokers at enrolment. Erythrocyte GPX activity was influenced by the GPX1 Pro(198)Leu genotype, gender, smoking intensity, and intake of fruits and vegetables. Our results indicate that lifestyle-related oxidative stress may be a risk factor for colorectal cancer among subjects with a lowered defence."
ACSL1 (acyl-CoA synthetase 1), the major acyl-CoA synthetase of adipocytes, has been proposed to function in adipocytes as mediating free fatty acid influx, esterification, and storage as triglyceride. To test this hypothesis, ACSL1 was stably silenced (knockdown (kd)) in 3T3-L1 cells, differentiated into adipocytes, and evaluated for changes in lipid metabolism. Surprisingly, ACSL1-silenced adipocytes exhibited no significant changes in basal or insulin-stimulated long-chain fatty acid uptake, lipid droplet size, or tri-, di-, or monoacylglycerol levels when compared with a control adipocyte line. However, ACSL1 kd adipocytes displayed a 7-fold increase in basal and a approximately 15% increase in forskolin-stimulated fatty acid efflux without any change in glycerol release, indicating a role for the protein in fatty acid reesterification following lipolysis. Consistent with this proposition, ACSL1 kd cells exhibited a decrease in activation and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase and its primary substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Moreover, ACSL1 kd adipocytes displayed an increase in phosphorylated protein kinase C and phosphorylated JNK, attenuated insulin signaling, and a decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. These findings identify a primary role of ACSL1 in adipocytes not in control of lipid influx, as previously considered, but in lipid efflux and fatty acid-induced insulin resistance.
CYP2C19 is expressed polymorphically with about 21 variant alleles. Genotype-phenotype association studies of CYP2C19 have shown marked deviations, suggesting the presence of other variations in the intronic and 5' regulatory region affecting its expression. This study aims to identify the genetic polymorphisms and construction of haplotypes of variations in 5' regulatory region of CYP2C19 among the South Indian population. CYP2C19 5' regulatory region was amplified and sequenced from the DNA of 58 healthy volunteers of South Indian origin. Genetic analysis revealed the existence of 14 variations including eight novel ones in the 5' regulatory region. Identified novel variations and their percentage frequencies were: -779A>C (16.4), -828T>A (2.6), -934del>T (3.5), -1051T>C (1.72), -1289T>G (3.4), -1442T>C (12.1), -1498T>G (25.0) and -1558T>G (2.6). The reported variations found in the study population and their frequencies were: -98T>C (28.4), -806C>T (2.6), -833del>T (9.5), 889T>G (10.3), -1041A>G (100.0) and -1418C>T (1.7). The two known non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, 681G>A ((*)2 allele) and 636G>A ((*)3 allele) were detected at 0.371 and 0.025 frequencies, respectively. Forty three haplotypes were constructed and linkage disequilibrium analysis showed strong linkage between several variations identified in the gene. Fourteen polymorphisms including 8 novel ones in CYP2C19 5' flanking region are reported for the first time in an Indian population from South India. Results from this study provide additional information for genotyping of CYP2C19 in the South Indian population and probably in the Indian population.
CYP2C19 and CYP2E1 show great genetic differences between Orientals and Caucasians. The objective of this study was to investigate the genotype and allele distribution patterns of CYP2C19 and CYP2E1 polymorphisms among healthy participants in mainland Chinese Kazakh, Uygur and Han populations by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. The allele frequencies of CYP2C19 2, CYP2E1 5B and CYP2E1 6 were significantly lower in the Chinese Kazakh (15.4, 11.2 and 14.5%, respectively) (P<0.05) and Uygur (16.1, 12.1 and 18.8%) (P<0.05) populations than that in the Chinese Han population (28.8, 19.4 and 26.2%), but the frequencies of CYP2C19 3 were similar among the three populations (8.0, 9.4 and 7.2%). Frequencies of the three combined genotypes, one for predicted CYP2C19 poor metabolizers and two for predicted high levels of CYP2E1 transcription, were significantly lower in the Chinese Kazakh (7.5, 19.6 and 28.0%, respectively) (P<0.05, chi(2)-test) and Uygur (8.1, 22.8 and 33.6%) (P<0.05) populations compared with the Chinese Han population (16.5, 35.9 and 44.7%). The present research shows that frequencies of the functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 and CYP2E1 genes vary in the Chinese Kazakh, Uygur and Han populations, suggesting that disease susceptibilities or drug responses associated with enzyme activities of CYP2C19 and CYP2E1 may differ in the diverse ethnic populations in mainland China.
CNP (C-type natriuretic peptide) is a vasodilatory peptide produced by vascular endothelium and the human heart with a short half-life. CNP has been identified within the human kidney; however, few results are available on whether the human kidney is a systemic source of CNP. The aim of the present study was to establish whether CNP is secreted by the human kidney and if synthesis is blunted in CHF (chronic heart failure). A total of 20 male subjects (age, 57+/-2 years; mean+/-S.E.M.) undergoing CHF assessment (n=13) or investigation of paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmia (normal left ventricular function in sinus rhythm during procedure) (n=7) were recruited. Renal CNP production was determined from concomitant plasma concentrations in the aorta and renal vein. When considering all subjects, a significant step-up in plasma CNP was found from the aorta to renal vein (3.0+/-0.3 compared with 8.3+/-2.4 pg/ml respectively; P=0.0045). The mean increase in CNP was 5.3+/-2.4 pg/ml (range, -0.9 to +45.3 pg/ml). In patients with CHF, the aortic concentration was 3.3+/-0.4 pg/ml compared with a renal vein concentration of 4.3+/-0.6 pg/ml (P=0.11). In those with normal left ventricular function, the respective values were 2.5+/-0.5 and 15.7+/-6.0 pg/ml (P=0.01). In conclusion, CNP is synthesized and secreted into the circulation by the normal human kidney, where it may have paracrine actions. Net renal secretion of CNP appears to be blunted in patients with CHF.
ESD is a new diagnostic and treatment technique for early gastric cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects observed at our department.
GBA and LRRK2 mutations increase susceptibility to Parkinson disease (PD), which is characterized by various disabling symptoms. An extended cohort of 600 Ashkenazi PD patients was screened for the LRRK2 G2019S and for eight GBA mutations. Reported initial symptoms were compared between three genotypic groups of patients: carriers of GBA mutations, carriers of LRRK2 G2019S mutation, and non-carriers. More LRRK2 G2019S carriers reported muscle stiffness (rigidity, p = 0.007) and balance disturbances (p = 0.008), while more GBA mutation carriers reported slowness (bradykinesia, p = 0.021). These results suggest distinct effects of LRRK2 or GBA mutations on the initial symptoms of PD.
ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) is an efflux transporter that limits the cellular uptake levels of various drugs in intestine, brain, and other tissues. The expression of human ABCB1 has recently been reported to be under the control of nuclear receptor NR1I subfamily members, pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3). Here, we have investigated the involvement of another NR1I member, vitamin D receptor (VDR, NR1I1), in ABCB1 expression. In the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line LS174T, which abundantly expresses VDR, both 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-VD3) and lithocholic acid (LCA) increased ABCB1 mRNA levels. Reporter gene assays in LS174T cells with constructs containing various lengths of the ABCB1 regulatory region revealed that the region containing multiple nuclear receptor binding motifs located at -7.8 kilobases [termed nuclear receptor-responsive module (NURREM)], to which PXR and CAR also bind, is essential for the VDR-mediated ABCB1 transactivation. Further reporter assays with constructs containing truncated NURREM and gel shift assays suggested simultaneous binding of multiple VDR/retinoid X receptor alpha heterodimers to NURREM. Furthermore, knockdown of VDR expression in LS174T cells blocked the LCA- and the 1,25-VD3-induced transcription of ABCB1 reporter genes. In human hepatoma HepG2 cells, in contrast with LS174T cells, 1,25-VD3 activated the ABCB1 transcription only in the presence of ectopically expressed VDR. These results suggest that the NR1I subfamily members regulate the ABCB1 expression sharing the binding sites within NURREM and that the physiologically produced LCA and 1,25-VD3 may modulate the ABCB1 expression in human intestines, possibly associated with interindividual variations of ABCB1 expression.
ACAT2 is a major cholesterol esterification enzyme specifically expressed in hepatocytes and may control the amount of hepatic free (unesterified) cholesterol available for secretion into bile or into HDL. This study aims to further elucidate physiologic roles of ACAT2 in human hepatic cholesterol metabolism.
CD36 is a membrane glycoprotein present on platelets, mononuclear phagocytes, adipocytes, hepatocytes, myocytes, and some epithelia. On microvascular endothelial cells, CD36 is a receptor for thrombospondin-1 and related proteins and functions as a negative regulator of angiogenesis. On phagocytes, through its functions as a scavenger receptor recognizing specific oxidized phospholipids and lipoproteins, CD36 participates in internalization of apoptotic cells, certain bacterial and fungal pathogens, and modified low-density lipoproteins, thus contributing to inflammatory responses and atherothrombotic diseases. CD36 also binds long-chain fatty acids and facilitates their transport into cells, thus participating in muscle lipid utilization, adipose energy storage, and gut fat absorption and possibly contributing to the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and obesity. On sensory cells, CD36 is involved in insect pheromone signaling and rodent fatty food preference. The signaling pathways downstream of CD36 involve ligand-dependent recruitment and activation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, specific mitogen-activated protein kinases, and the Vav family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors; modulation of focal adhesion constituents; and generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. CD36 in many cells is localized in specialized cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains and may also interact with other membrane receptors, such as tetraspanins and integrins. Identification of the precise CD36 signaling pathways in specific cells elicited in response to specific ligands may yield novel targets for drug development.
ATP8B1 deficiency is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in ATP8B1, which encodes the putative phospatidylserine flippase ATP8B1 (formerly called FIC1). ATP8B1 deficiency is primarily characterized by cholestasis, but extrahepatic symptoms are also found. Because patients sometimes report reduced hearing capability, we investigated the role of ATP8B1 in auditory function. Here we show that ATP8B1/Atp8b1 deficiency, both in patients and in Atp8b1(G308V/G308V) mutant mice, causes hearing loss, associated with progressive degeneration of cochlear hair cells. Atp8b1 is specifically localized in the stereocilia of these hair cells. This indicates that the mechanosensory function and integrity of the cochlear hair cells is critically dependent on ATP8B1 activity, possibly through maintaining lipid asymmetry in the cellular membranes of stereocilia.
ACAT2 is thought to be responsible for cholesteryl ester production in chylomicron and VLDL assembly. Recently, we identified HNF1alpha as an important regulator of the human ACAT2 promoter. Thus, we hypothesized that MODY3 (HNF1alpha gene mutations) and possibly MODY1 (HNF4alpha, upstream regulator of HNF1alpha, gene mutations) subjects may have lower VLDL esterified cholesterol.
NPR1 is a key transcriptional coregulator in plant defense responses. In this issue, Spoel et al. (2009) demonstrate that proteasome-mediated degradation of NPR1 in the nucleus promotes efficient expression of defense response genes following infection and prevents spurious activation of defensive responses in the absence of infection.
MPO (myeloperoxidase) catalyses the oxidation of chloride, bromide and thiocyanate by H(2)O(2) to HOCl (hypochlorous acid), HOBr (hypobromous acid) and HOSCN (hypothiocyanous acid, also know as cyanosulfenic acid) respectively. Specificity constants indicate that thiocyanate, SCN-, is a major substrate for MPO. HOSCN is also a major oxidant generated by other peroxidases including salivary, gastric and eosinophil peroxidases. Whereas HOCl and HOBr are powerful oxidizing agents, HOSCN appears to be a less reactive, but more thiol-specific oxidant. Although it is established that HOSCN selectively targets thiols, absolute kinetic data for the reactions of thiols with HOSCN are absent from the literature. This study shows for the first time that the reactions of HOSCN with low-molecular-mass thiol residues occur with rate constants in the range from 7.3 x 10(3) M(-1).s(-1) (for N-acetyl-cysteine at pH 7.4) to 7.7 x 10(6) M(-1).s(-1) (for 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid at pH 6.0). An inverse relationship between the rate of reaction and the pKa of the thiol group was observed. The rates of reaction of HOSCN with thiol-containing proteins were also investigated for four proteins (creatine kinase, BSA, beta-lactoglobulin and beta-L-crystallins). The values obtained for cysteine residues on these proteins are in the range 1 x 10(4)- 7 x 10(4) M(-1).s(-1). These second-order rate constants indicate that HOSCN is a major mediator of thiol oxidation in biological systems exposed to peroxidase/H(2)O(2) systems at (patho)physiological concentrations of halide and SCN- ions, and that HOSCN may play an important role in inflammation-induced oxidative damage.
RDH12 mutations are responsible for early-onset autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy, which results in profound retinal pathology and severe visual handicap in patients. To investigate the function of RDH12 within the network of retinoid dehydrogenases/reductases (RDHs) present in retina, we studied the retinal phenotype of Rdh12-deficient mice. In vivo rates of all-trans-retinal reduction and 11-cis-retinal formation during recovery from bleaching were similar in Rdh12-deficient and wild-type mice matched for an Rpe65 polymorphism that impacts visual cycle efficiency. However, retinal homogenates from Rdh12-deficient mice exhibited markedly decreased capacity to reduce exogenous retinaldehydes in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo levels of the bisretinoid compound diretinoid-pyridinium-ethanolamine (A2E) were increased in Rdh12-deficient mice of various genetic backgrounds. Conversely, in vivo levels of retinoic acid and total retinol were significantly decreased. Rdh12 transcript levels in wild-type mice homozygous for the Rpe65-Leu(450) polymorphism were greater than in Rpe65-Met(450) mice and increased during postnatal development in wild-type mice and Nrl-deficient mice having an all-cone retina. Rdh12-deficient mice did not exhibit increased retinal degeneration relative to wild-type mice at advanced ages, when bred on the light-sensitive BALB/c background, or when heterozygous for a null allele of superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2(+/-)). Our findings suggest that a critical function of RDH12 is the reduction of all-trans-retinal that exceeds the reductive capacity of the photoreceptor outer segments.
SMYD3 is a SET domain-containing protein with histone methyltransferase activity on histone H3-K4. Recent studies showed that SMYD3 is frequently overexpressed in different types of cancer cells, but how SMYD3 regulates the development and progression of these malignancies remains unknown. Here, we report the previously unrecognized role of SMYD3 in estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated transcription via its histone methyltransferase activity. We demonstrate that SMYD3 functions as a coactivator of ERalpha and potentiates ERalpha activity in response to ligand. SMYD3 directly interacts with the ligand binding domain of ER and is recruited to the proximal promoter regions of ER target genes upon gene induction. Importantly, our chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses provide compelling evidence that SMYD3 is responsible for the accumulation of di- and trimethylation of H3-K4 at the induced ER target genes. Furthermore, RNA interference-directed down-regulation of SMYD3 reveals that SMYD3 is required for ER-regulated gene transcription in estrogen signaling pathway. Thus, our results identify SMYD3 as a new coactivator for ER-mediated transcription, providing a possible link between SMYD3 overexpression and breast cancer.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is a negative regulator of the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-Akt (also called protein kinase B) signalling pathway and is essential for embryogenesis, but its function in early vertebrate embryos is unclear.
DHCR24 (24-dehydrocholesterol reductase), or seladin-1, is one of the most expressed genes in the adrenal gland. Because the rat and human adult adrenal cortex differ in their respective functional properties, the aim of the present study was to verify whether seladin-1 may be differentially involved in basal and ACTH-stimulated steroidogenesis and oxidative stress management. Seladin-1 expression was predominantly observed in both human and rat zona fasciculata, with a predominant cytoplasmic localization in human cells and a nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution in rat cells. In human fasciculata cells, localization of the protein was primarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Although its expression was increased by ACTH, its intracellular localization was not altered by ACTH treatment (10 nm) or by the seladin-1 inhibitor U18666A (75 nm). Preincubation with U18666A did not modify the ACTH-induced increase in cortisol secretion but abolished the ACTH-induced increase in dehydroepiandrosterone secretion. In rat fasciculata cells, ACTH induced a massive redistribution of seladin-1 from the cytoplasm (cis-Golgi apparatus) to the nucleus, which was inhibited by preincubation with U18666A. Preincubation with U18666A also decreased ACTH-induced seladin-1 and 11beta-hydroxylase protein expression as well as corticosterone production, increased ACTH-induced ROS production but decreased ACTH-induced expression of the detoxifying protein aldo-ketoreductase 1b7. Thus, protection against acutely elevated ACTH-induced oxidative stress in rat fasciculata cells is correlated with nuclear relocalization of seladin-1 and its effects on cellular detoxifying machinery. Altogether, these results indicate that seladin-1 expression and intracellular localization are correlated with both the intensity and nature of ACTH-induced steroidogenesis and resultant oxidative stress.
CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that are highly expressed in the liver and gut and metabolize endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The bioavailability of statins is affected by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 and glucuronidases metabolism as well as uptake and efflux transporters that affect drug disposition. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 variants have been demonstrated to influence the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of statins. Inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 play an important role in reducing statin efficacy and increase the risk of adverse effects, respectively. Statins have been demonstrated to increase CYP3A expression in vitro, most likely because they are ligands to nuclear receptors (pregnane X receptor and constitutive androsterone receptor) that form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors and bind to responsive elements in the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 promoter regions. This special report outlines the earlier studies on variability of response to statins owing to CYP3A variants and highlights findings on the induction of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 expression by statins.
CYP1A1 is one of the main cytochrome P450 enzymes, examined extensively for its capacity to activate compounds with carcinogenic properties. Continuous exposure to inhalation chemicals and environmental carcinogens is thought to increase the level of CYP1A1 expression in extrahepatic tissues, through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Although the latter has long been recognized as a ligand-induced transcription factor, which is responsible for the xenobiotic activating pathway of several phase I and phase II metabolizing enzymes, recent evidence suggests that the AhR is involved in various cell signaling pathways critical to cell cycle regulation and normal homeostasis. Disregulation of these pathways is implicated in tumor progression. In addition, it is becoming increasingly evident that CYP1A1 plays an important role in the detoxication of environmental carcinogens, as well as in the metabolic activation of dietary compounds with cancer preventative activity. Ultimately the contribution of CYP1A1 to cancer progression or prevention may depend on the balance of procarcinogen activation/detoxication and dietary natural product extrahepatic metabolism.
CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms are widely studied in several ethnic groups, however they are less known in the Roma population. The aim of this work was to study the ethnic differences of the CYP2C9 allele distribution in a healthy Roma population in order to compare them with a healthy Hungarian population. A total of 535 Hungarian and 465 Roma volunteers were genotyped for the CYP2C9*2 (Arg144Cys) and CYP2C9*3 (Ile359Leu) allelic variants by PCR-RFLP assay. The frequencies of the CYP2C9*1, *2 and *3 alleles in the Hungarian population were 0.787, 0.125, and 0.088 and in Roma 0.727, 0.118, and 0.155, respectively. We found a significant difference in CYP2C9*3 prevalence between the Hungarian and Roma populations, which have therapeutic consequences (p<0.005). The distribution of *1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3, *2/*2, *2/*3, and *3/*3 genotypes in Hungarians were 0.620, 0.195, 0.139, 0.021, 0.015, and 0.011, while in Roma were 0.533, 0.168, 0.219, 0.011, 0.047, and 0.022, respectively. A significant difference was found between the Hungarian and Roma populations regarding the *1/*1, *1/*3 and the *2/*3 (p<0.005) genotypes. This is the first study to investigate the polymorphisms of CYP2C9 gene in the two largest populations in Hungary, healthy Hungarians and Roma. The prevalence of variant CYP2C9 alleles in the Hungarian population is similar to that observed in other European populations. In contrast, the Roma population differs from Hungarians, from most of other Caucasian groups, and from Indians in the incidence of CYP2C9 common variants. The difference in allele distribution patterns between the two populations studied has therapeutic implications as it influences the optimization of therapies.
CYP2C9 is a polymorphic enzyme that metabolizes a number of clinically important drugs. In this study, catalytic activities of seven alleles found in Japanese individuals, CYP2C9*3 (I359L), *13 (L90P), *26 (T130R), *28 (Q214L), *30 (A477T), *33 (R132Q), and *34 (R335Q), were assessed using three substrates (diclofenac, losartan, and glimepiride). When expressed in a baculovirus-insect cell system, the holo and total (apo and holo) CYP2C9 protein expression levels were similar among the wild type (CYP2C9.1) and six variants except for CYP2C9.13. A large part of CYP2C9.13 was present in the apo form P420. Compared with CYP2C9.1, all variants except for CYP2C9.34 exhibited substrate-dependent changes in K(m), V(max), and intrinsic clearance (V(max)/K(m)). For diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation, the intrinsic clearance was decreased markedly (by >80%) in CYP2C9.13, CYP2C9.30, and CYP2C9.33 and variably (63-76%) in CYP2C9.3, CYP2C9.26, and CYP2C9.28 due to increased K(m) and/or decreased V(max) values. For losartan oxidation, CYP2C9.13 and CYP2C9.28 showed 2.5- and 1.8-fold higher K(m) values, respectively, and all variants except for CYP2C9.34 showed >77% lower V(max) and intrinsic clearance values. For glimepiride hydroxylation, the K(m) of CYP2C9.13 was increased 7-fold, and the V(max) values of all variants significantly decreased, resulting in reductions in the intrinsic clearance by >80% in CYP2C9.3, CYP2C9.13, CYP2C9.26, and CYP2C9.33 and by 56 to 75% in CYP2C9.28 and CYP2C9.30. These findings suggest the necessity for careful administration of losartan and glimepiride to patients bearing these six alleles.
ABCG2 is a membrane-localized, human transporter protein that has been demonstrated to reduce the intracellular accumulation of substrates through ATP-dependent efflux. Highly expressed in placental syncytiotrophoblasts, brain microvasculature, and the gastrointestinal tract, ABCG2 has been shown to mediate normal tissue protection as well as limit oral bioavailability of substrate compounds. Development of ABCG2 inhibitors for clinical use may allow increased penetration of therapeutic agents into sanctuary sites and increased gastrointestinal absorption. Previously identified inhibitors have lacked potency or specificity or were toxic at concentrations needed to inhibit ABCG2; none are in clinical development. A previously developed high-throughput assay measuring inhibition of ABCG2-mediated pheophorbide a transport was applied to natural product extract libraries. Among the active samples were extracts from the marine ascidian Botryllus tyreus. Bioassay-guided fractionation resulted in purification of a series of botryllamides. Ten botryllamides were obtained, two of which (designated I and J) were novel. Activity against ABCG2 was confirmed by assessing the ability of the compounds to inhibit ABCG2-mediated BODIPY-prazosin transport in ABCG2-transfected HEK293 cells, compete with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin (IAAP) labeling of ABCG2, stimulate ABCG2-associated ATPase activity, and reverse ABCG2-mediated resistance.
PDE10A is a dual substrate PDE that is highly expressed in medium spiny neurons of the striatal complex. The inhibition of PDE10A produces effects that modulate basal ganglia function in ways that suggest a particular therapeutic utility in the treatment of psychosis in schizophrenia. Significant understanding of PDE10A at the molecular level has helped to guide efforts in inhibitor design, and many different inhibitor classes have now been discovered. At least one PDE10A inhibitor has been advanced into clinical trials to begin to test the hypothesis that such agents may be useful in the treatment of psychosis.
ATP1B1 encodes the beta subunits of Na/K ATPase which plays an important role in maintaining the normal gradients of Na(+) and K(+) across plasma membrane. A recent study demonstrated an association of ATP1B1 genetic variations with blood pressure (BP) in Americans. We aimed to investigate the association between ATP1B1 polymorphisms with BP and hypertension in a Chinese population.
ABCG2 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transporters, the overexpression of which is associated with tumor resistance to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents. Accordingly, combining ABCG2 inhibitor(s) with chemotherapy has the potential to improve treatment outcome. To search for clinically useful ABCG2 inhibitors, a bioluminescence imaging (BLI)-based assay was developed to allow high-throughput compound screening. This assay exploits our finding that d-luciferin, the substrate of firefly luciferase (fLuc), is a specific substrate of ABCG2, and ABCG2 inhibitors block the export of d-luciferin and enhance bioluminescence signal by increasing intracellular d-luciferin concentrations. HEK293 cells, engineered to express ABCG2 and fLuc, were used to screen the Hopkins Drug Library that includes drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as drug candidates that have entered phase II clinical trials. Forty-seven compounds showed BLI enhancement, a measure of anti-ABCG2 activity, of > or =5-fold, the majority of which were not previously known as ABCG2 inhibitors. The assay was validated by its identification of known ABCG2 inhibitors and by confirming previously unknown ABCG2 inhibitors using established in vitro assays (e.g., mitoxantrone resensitization and BODIPY-prazosin assays). Glafenine, a potent new inhibitor, also inhibited ABCG2 activity in vivo. The BLI-based assay is an efficient method to identify new inhibitors of ABCG2. As they were derived from a FDA-approved compound library, many of the inhibitors uncovered in this study are ready for clinical testing.
ABO genotyping is commonly used in cases of an ABO discrepancy between cell typing and serum typing, as well as in forensic practice for personal identification and paternity testing. We evaluated ABO genotyping via multiplex allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) amplification using whole blood samples without DNA purification.
UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 are among the most commonly deleted genes in humans and encode members of the uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase 2B (UGT2B) subfamily. They are involved, along with UGT2B15, in the catabolism of sex-steroid hormones. Despite the recent biomedical interest in UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 copy-number variations (CNVs) within human populations, the impact of their gene dosage has been hampered by the lack of precise molecular identification of the common deletion breakpoints within high homology sequence regions on chromosome 4. We have characterized these common deletions and report their coexistence in Caucasians, along with the p.D85Y (rs1902023:G>T) functional polymorphism of UGT2B15. Segmental duplications of 4.9 kb for UGT2B17 and 6.8 kb for UGT2B28 comprise purine-rich recombination sites located 117 kb and 108 kb apart on both ends of the deletions. CNVs of UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 occur in Caucasians at 27% and 13.5%, respectively. While only 43% have two copies of both genes, 57% harbor at least one deletion. Their co-occurrence on 5% of chromosomes creates a 225-kb genomic gap. CNVs of both UGT2B17 and UGT2B28, with the co-occurrence of UGT2B15:p.D85Y, generate seven distinct haplotypes. Restricting the analyses to CNV of the UGT2B17 gene without evaluating UGT2B28 CNV, along with the genotype of UGT2B15, may over- or underestimate the impact of each gene under physiological conditions or disease states.
CYP2B6 plays an important role in metabolizing various drugs in common clinical use. Increasing interest in CYP2B6 genetic polymorphism was stimulated by revelations of a specific CYP2B6 genotype significantly affecting the metabolism of efavirenz, an anti-HIV type-1 agent. The present study determined the CYP2B6 haplotype in 100 healthy unrelated Mongolian volunteers by analyzing the genotypes of nine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) positions (-82T>C, 64C>T, 499C>T, 516G>T, 777C>A, 785A>G, 983T>C, 1375A>G, and 1459C>T) in the CYP2B6 gene. The CYP2B6 *1 allele was the most frequent in the Mongolian population tested at 64.5%, higher than the equivalent frequency in African-Americans and Ghanaians. The second most frequent allele was CYP2B6 *6 (21.0%), although this allele was less frequent than that in Ghanaians. Only one CYP2B6 *5 allele was identified in our Mongolian subjects (0.5%), although it is the third most frequent allele in white and African-American populations. These CYP2B6 genotypes revealed seven slow efavirenz metabolizers in 100 Mongolians, which is significantly fewer than the same group among Ghanaians. Overall, the Mongolian CYP2B6 allele distribution was comparable with that in Japanese, Koreans, and Han Chinese. This is the first report of CYP2B6 genotype frequency in a Mongolian population, and it could provide clinically useful information on drug metabolism in this population group.
CYP3A4 metabolizes many drugs on the market. Although transcriptional regulation of CYP3A4 is known to be tightly controlled by some nuclear receptors (NR) including vitamin D receptor (VDR/NR1I1), posttranscriptional regulation of CYP3A4 remains elusive. In this study, we show that noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) may control posttranscriptional and transcriptional regulation of CYP3A4 by directly targeting the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of CYP3A4 and indirectly targeting the 3'UTR of VDR, respectively. Luciferase reporter assays showed that CYP3A4 3'UTR-luciferase activity was significantly decreased in human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with plasmid that expressed microRNA-27b (miR-27b) or mouse microRNA-298 (mmu-miR-298), whereas the activity was unchanged in cells transfected with plasmid that expressed microRNA-122a or microRNA-328. Disruption of the corresponding miRNA response element (MRE) within CYP3A4 3'UTR led to a 2- to 3-fold increase in luciferase activity. Immunoblot analyses indicated that CYP3A4 protein was down-regulated over 30% by miR-27b and mmu-miR-298 in LS-180 and PANC1 cells. The decrease in CYP3A4 protein expression was associated with significantly decreased CYP3A4 mRNA levels, as determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses. Likewise, interactions of miR-27b or mmu-miR-298 with VDR 3'UTR were supported by luciferase reporter assays. The mmu-miR-298 MRE site is well conserved within the 3'UTR of mouse, rat, and human VDR. Down-regulation of VDR by the two miRNAs was supported by immunoblot and qPCR analyses. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-27b or mmu-miR-298 in PANC1 cells led to a lower sensitivity to cyclophosphamide. Together, these findings suggest that CYP3A4 gene expression may be regulated by miRNAs at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level.
CYP2C9 enzymes are involved in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) metabolism. Therefore, we investigated whether CYP2C9*2 and *3 variant alleles, encoding for enzymes with lower activity, increased the protective effect of NSAIDs on colorectal cancer.
CYP2C19 is clinically important in Korea because of the relatively high incidence of poor metabolizers in the population. To fully understand the genetic mechanism of the CYP2C19 defect in poor metabolizers, all variants need to be studied simultaneously. The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of CYP2C19 haplotypes as a marker of CYP2C19 enzyme activity in Koreans.
AQP1 belongs to aquaporins family, water-specific, membrane-channel proteins expressed in diverse tissues. Recent papers showed that during angiogenesis, AQP1 is expressed preferentially by microvessels, favoring angiogenesis via the increase of permeability In particular, in AQP1 null mice, endothelial cell migration is impaired without altering their proliferation or adhesion. Therefore, AQP1 has been proposed as a novel promoter of tumor angiogenesis.
CYP2D6 accounts for only a small percentage of total hepatic CYPs (<2%), but it metabolizes approximately 25% of clinically used drugs (>100) with significant polymorphisms. A number of drugs acting on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system are substantially metabolized by CYP2D6. The enzyme also utilizes hydroxytryptamines and neurosteroids as endogenous substrates. In addition, CYP2D6 metabolizes procarcinogens and neurotoxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline, and indolealkylamines. Typical CYP2D6 substrates are usually lipophilic bases with a planar hydrophobic aromatic ring and a nitrogen atom which can be protonated at physiological pH, but several atypical substrates such as spirosulfonamide and pactimibe do not contain a basic nitrogen atom. The structure of human CYP2D6 has been recently determined and shows the characteristic CYP fold as observed in other members of the CYP superfamily, with a well-defined active site cavity above the heme group with a volume of approximately 540 A(3). CYP2D6 is largely uninducible by prototypical CYP inducers such as phenobarbital, rifampin and dexamethasone, but it is regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha, a nuclear receptor. CYP2D6 is subject to inhibition by a number of drugs and this may provide an explanation for numerous clinical drug interactions. CYP2D6 has an important role in drug development and it is a common practice for pharmaceutical industry nowadays to a great extent screen drug candidates early in development as possible CYP2D6 substrates and/or inhibitors and drop such candidates where they have alternatives. This candidate selection might eventually lead to a less prominent role of this enzyme in the future for drug metabolism and less interindividual variability in drug exposure and minimize potentially adverse drug interactions. Further studies are warranted to delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in the function and regulation of CYP2D6.
MTHFR is an enzyme involved in the folate pathway. It has been suggested that common polymorphisms in its gene (C677T and A1298C) could be related to different methotrexate (MTX) response and toxicity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Agreement has not been found yet and there is no data on rheumatic Italian patients. The aim of this study is to determine if a genetic screening can help in planning the treatment in these patients.
CD36 has been shown to play a role in atherosclerosis in the apolipoprotein E-knockout (apoE(o)) mouse. We observed no difference in aortic lesion area between Western diet (WD)-fed LDLR(o) and LDLR(o)/CD36(o) mice. The objective was to understand the mechanism of CD36-dependent atherogenesis.
WWOX is a tumour suppressor gene affected in multiple cancers, especially in breast, prostate and ovary. This gene is located at the chromosomal area 16q23.3-24.1, which was identified as a common chromosomal fragile site FRA16D. WWOX turned out to possess tumour suppressor features despite the fact that the most basic (classical) way of tumour suppressor gene inactivation involves both alleles (e.g. through deletions, point mutations and promoter methylation), which is very rare event in a case of WWOX, occurring only in few cell lines. A large number of papers corroborate the phenomenon of correlation between the loss of WWOX expression and more aggressive/worse prognosis in many different types of tumours, for example breast cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer or sporadic meningiomas. Ectopically increased WWOX expression promotes migration through basal membrane, however suppresses anchorage independent growth and induces normal-like colony formation in matrigel.
ACE inhibitors and loop diuretics are treatments of first choice for heart failure, but patients must take their medications regularly to achieve maximum benefit. Adherence is commonly assessed using pill counts, self-report or electronic monitoring, with the latter widely considered the 'gold standard'. We assessed the concordance of these three methods in a sample of 52 elderly patients with heart failure over a six-week period. Substantial differences in adherence were found between the three methods. Adherence by self-report was very high for both ACE-I and diuretic, with little between-person variation. This was, however, uncorroborated by pill count and electronic monitoring. Closer examination of the electronic record suggested that the mean level of adherence overlooked patterns of openings more consistent with adherent behaviour. There seems to be no gold standard for measurement of adherence in this population.
NSDHL (NAD(P)H sterol dehydrogenase-like), is a 3beta-hydroxysterol dehydrogenase thought to function in the demethylation of sterol precursors in one of the later steps of cholesterol biosynthesis. Mutations in the X-linked NSDHL gene cause CHILD syndrome in humans, and the male-lethal bare patches (Bpa) phenotype in mice. The relative level of NSDHL expression among different mouse tissues at several stages of embryogenesis and postnatal development was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In wild type (WT) embryos, the highest levels of expression were seen in the liver, dorsal root ganglia, central nervous system, retina, adrenal gland and testis. Heterozygous Bpa(1H) females are mosaic for NSDHL expression due to normal random X-inactivation. NSDHL-deficient cells were detected in the developing cerebral cortex and retina of Bpa(1H) female embryos. In postnatal WT and Bpa(1H) animals, we compared the expression pattern of NSDHL in skin, an affected tissue; liver, a main site of cholesterol synthesis; and brain, a tissue dependent on endogenous synthesis of cholesterol due to lack of transport across the blood-brain barrier. Clonal populations of mutant cells were visible in the brain, skin and liver of Bpa(1H) pups. In the liver, the proportion of NSDHL negative cells dropped from approximately 50% at postnatal day 6 to approximately 20% at one year of age. In the brain, which showed the highest expression in cerebral cortical and hippocampal neurons, the proportion of NSDHL negative cells also dropped dramatically over the first year of life. Our results suggest that while NSDHL-deficient cells in the mosaic Bpa(1H) female are able to survive and differentiate during embryonic development, they are subject to negative selection over the life of the animal.
ABCG2 is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that counts multiple anticancer compounds among its substrates and is believed to regulate oral bioavailability as well as serve a protective role in the blood-brain barrier, the maternal-fetal barrier, and hematopoietic stem cells. We sought to determine whether novel compounds that interact with the transporter could be identified through analysis of cytotoxicity profiles recorded in the NCI Anticancer Drug Screen database. A flow cytometric assay was used to measure ABCG2 function in the 60 cell lines and generate a molecular profile for COMPARE analysis. This strategy identified >70 compounds with Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) >0.4, where reduced drug sensitivity correlated with ABCG2 expression, as well as >120 compounds with PCCs < -0.4, indicating compounds to which ABCG2 expression conferred greater sensitivity. Despite identification of known single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ABCG2 gene in a number of the cell lines, omission of these lines from the COMPARE analysis did not affect PCCs. Available compounds were subjected to validation studies to confirm interaction with the transporter, including flow cytometry, [(125)I]IAAP binding, and cytotoxicity assays, and interaction was documented in 20 of the 27 compounds studied. Although known substrates of ABCG2 such as mitoxantrone or topotecan were not identified, we characterized three novel substrates-5-hydroxypicolinaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (NSC107392), (E)-N-(1-decylsulfanyl-3-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-3-(6-methyl-2,4-dioxo-1H-pyrimidin-5-yl)prop-2-enamide (NSC265473), and 1,2,3,4,7-pentahydroxy-1,3,4,4a,5,11b-hexahydro[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-j]phenanthridin-6(2H)-one [NSC349156 (pancratistatin)]-and four compounds that inhibited transporter function-2-[methyl(2-pyridin-2-ylethyl)-amino]fluoren-9-one hydroiodide (NSC24048), 5-amino-6-(7-amino-5,8-dihydro-6-methoxy-5,8-dioxo-2-quinolinyl)-4-(2-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-2-pyridinecarboxylic acid, methyl ester (NSC45384), (17beta)-2,4-dibromo-estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol (NSC103054), and methyl N-(pyridine-4-carbonylamino)carbamodithioate (NSC636795). In summary, COMPARE analysis of the NCI drug screen database using the ABCG2 functional profile was able to identify novel substrates and transporter-interacting compounds.
SRM 2905 Trace Particulate Explosives was developed to simulate the residues produced by handling plastic and military explosives. A series of nine candidate materials were prepared by coating chromatographic supports with either Composition C-4 (containing RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-Triazine) and HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-Tetrazocine)) or TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene). Criteria for selection of the best material for the SRM included: coating efficiency, extractability with organic solvents, thermal storage stability, consistency of the particle size with fingerprint residues, and suitability for calibration of trace explosives detectors. The final base material selected for the SRM was octadecylsilane-modified silica (C(18)) with a nominal 20-30 microm particle size. Four materials comprise the SRM, with two nominal concentrations of explosive, 0.01% and 0.1% (mass fraction) for both C-4 and TNT, respectively. The final certified concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography (LC) with ultraviolet absorbance detection (LC/UV) and a liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric (LC/MS) method using negative ion atmospheric pressure ionization (APCI(-)) with an acetate ionization additive that improves quantitation. The SRM was tested on a table-top field explosives detector based ion mobility spectrometry (IMS).
ABCB1 gene overexpression has been described as an important mechanism for resistance to conventional chemotherapy in multiple myelomas. In the refractory multiple myelomas, other drug regimens have been successfully applied, including thalidomide treatments. Besides its well-documented anti-angiogenic effects, thalidomide therapy could result in a decrease in ABCB1 gene expression. In this study, we analysed the effects of a 24-h short-term treatment by thalidomide or its active metabolite phthaloyl glutamic acid (PGA) on nuclear chromatin higher-order organisation and ABCB1 gene expression in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant 8226 human myeloma cells. As compared to sensitive cells, 8226-Dox40 drug-resistant cells exhibited an increase in chromatin texture condensation and ABCB1 gene overexpression. At this gene promoter level, the -50 and -100 GC boxes displayed an unmethylated profile in drug-sensitive cells whereas drug-resistant cell promoter GC boxes were fully methylated. Thalidomide and PGA induced significant chromatin textural changes in 8226-Dox40 drug-resistant cells only with neither alteration in ABCB1 gene expression nor methylation profile of its promoter. Conversely thalidomide and PGA induced down-regulation of VEGF gene expression in both drug-sensitive and -resistant myeloma cells. These data suggest that short-term treatments by thalidomide or PGA do not induce any significant change on ABCB1 gene expression though they modulate chromatin supra-organisation in drug-resistant 8226 human myeloma cells.
CYP2D6 substrate status is a critical Go/No Go decision criteria in central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery efforts because the polymorphic nature of CYP2D6 can lead to variable patient safety and drug efficacy. In addition, CYP2D6 is disproportionately involved in the metabolism of CNS drugs compared with other drug classes. Therefore, identifying trends in small molecule properties of CNS-penetrant compounds that can help discriminate potential CYP2D6 substrates from nonsubstrates would allow additional prioritization in the synthesis and biological evaluation of new therapeutic candidates. We report here the conversion of the CNS drug minaprine from substrate to nonsubstrate, as well as the conversion of the related CNS drug minozac from nonsubstrate to substrate, through the use of analog synthesis and CYP2D6 enzyme kinetic analyses. No single molecular property strongly correlated with substrate status for this 3-amino-4-methyl-6-phenylpyridazine scaffold, although molecular volume and charge appeared to be indirectly related. A parsed database of CYP2D6 substrates across diverse chemical structures was assembled and analyzed for physical property trends correlating with substrate status. We found that a complex interplay of properties influenced CYP2D6 substrate status and that the particular chemical scaffold affects which properties are most prominent. The results also identified an unexpected issue in CNS drug discovery, in that some property trends correlative with CYP2D6 substrates overlap previously reported properties that correlate with CNS penetrance. These results suggest the need for a careful balance in the design and synthesis of new CNS therapeutic candidates to avoid CYP2D6 substrate status while maintaining CNS penetrance.
ABCB1 is a transmembrane transporter that is expressed in excretory organs (kidneys and liver), in intestine mucosa and on the blood-brain barrier. Because of the particular distribution of the protein, the activity of ABCB1 may significantly affect drug pharmacokinetics during absorption and distribution. Of note, several SNPs of ABCB1 are known and many of them affect transporter activity and/or expression. In this view, changes in the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are ABCB1 substrates could be clinically relevant and the evaluation of ABCB1 SNPs should deserve particular attention. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the possible association between ABCB1 polymorphisms and clozapine plasma levels in psychotic patients.
PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) encompasses four major clinically distinct syndromes associated with germline mutations in the tumor suppressor PTEN. These allelic disorders, Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, Proteus syndrome, and Proteus-like syndrome are associated with unregulated cellular proliferation leading to the formation of hamartomas. Thus far, an increased risk of malignancy has only been documented in Cowden syndrome; however, current recommendations advise that all individuals with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome follow the cancer surveillance strategies suggested for Cowden syndrome until further data indicate otherwise. Because any individual phenotypic feature of Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome are frequently present in the general population, many individuals often go undiagnosed and consequently do not benefit from available cancer surveillance strategies. Therefore, it is critical for clinicians to recognize the phenotypic features associated with these syndromes to accurately diagnose and provide preventative care. This overview details the clinical description of the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome and associated disorders, their diagnosis and molecular/genetic testing, as well as differential diagnosis for assessment of other hamartoma-associated syndromes.
LCAT plays a key role in the maturation of HDL, as evidenced by low HDL-cholesterol levels in carriers of deleterious mutations in LCAT. However, the role of LCAT in atherosclerosis is unclear. We set out to study this in a prospective study. Plasma LCAT levels, which strongly correlate with LCAT activity, were measured in baseline nonfasting samples of 933 apparently healthy men and women who developed coronary artery disease (CAD) and 1,852 matched controls who remained free of CAD during 6 year follow-up. LCAT levels did not differ between cases and controls but were higher in women than men. Stratification into LCAT quartiles revealed a positive association with plasma LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the unexpected absence of an association with HDL-cholesterol. In mixed-gender analyses, the odds ratio (OR) for future CAD in the highest LCAT quartile versus the lowest was 1.00 [confidence interval (CI): 0.76-1.29, P for linearity = 0.902], although opposite trends were observed in men and women. In fact, high LCAT levels were associated with an increased CAD risk in women (unadjusted OR 1.45, CI: 0.94-2.22, P for linearity = 0.036). In contrast to our studies in carriers of LCAT mutations, the current data show that low LCAT plasma levels are not associated with increased atherosclerosis in the general population.
"TAT peptide functionalized shell-core ZnS-CdSe quantum dots (QDs) have been prepared by three different methods, direct ligand exchange with cysteine-terminated TAT (TAT-QD(lig exch)), and covalent conjugation to QDs coated with silanes (TAT-QD(silica)) and polyacrylate derivatives (TAT-QD(polyacrylate)). The silica and polyacrylate coatings incorporated multiple primary and secondary amines, introducing positive surface charges onto the QDs, providing high water solubility and sites for peptide conjugation, while inducing the ""proton sponge effect"". The different coating methods produced particles of different sizes, surface charges, and colloidal stability; these factors jointly influenced the cellular uptake and subcellular localization of these particles. As the particle size increased, (TAT-QD(lig exch) (6 nm) < TAT-QD(silica) (10 nm) < QD(polyacrylate) (25 nm)), both the particle surface charge and cellular uptake increased. The smaller TAT-QD(lig exch) and TAT-QD(silica) particles were localized mainly in the perinuclear regions, while the larger TAT-QD(polyacrylate) particles were localized in both the perinuclear regions and the lysosomes. Compared to the other TAT-QDs, TAT-QD(lig-exch) has a lower colloidal stability and was more cytotoxic due to the weak binding of the ligands."
OTC analgesics were released for sale outside pharmacies in Norway in 2003. This study assesses indications and frequency of use of these drugs among 15-16 year-old teenagers in Norway after 2003.
ABCG2 is a half-ATP binding cassette (ABC) drug transporter that consists of a nucleotide binding domain (NBD) followed by a transmembrane domain. This half-ABC transporter is thought to form a homodimer in the plasma membrane where it transports anticancer drugs across the biological membranes in an ATP-dependent manner. Substitution of the putative catalytic residue E211 with a nonacidic amino acid glutamine (E211Q) completely abolished its ATPase activity and ATP-dependent methotrexate transport, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is required for the ATP-dependent solute transport. However, whether one ATP hydrolysis or two ATP hydrolyses in the homodimer of ABCG2 with the NBD.ATP.ATP.NBD sandwich structure is/are required for the ATP-dependent solute transport is not known yet. To address this question, we have made an YFP/ABCG2 fusion protein and expressed this 99 kDa fusion protein alone or along with the 70 kDa E211Q-mutated ABCG2 in BHK cells. Although membrane vesicles prepared from BHK cells expressing YFP/ABCG2 exert higher ATPase activity than that of wt ABCG2, the dATP-dependent methotrexate transport activities of these two proteins are the same. Interestingly, membrane vesicles prepared from BHK cells expressing both YFP/ABCG2 and E211Q-mutated ABCG2 (with a ratio of 1:1) form homodimers and heterodimer and exert 55% of wt ABCG2 ATPase activity that can be further enhanced by anticancer drugs, suggesting that the wt NBD in the heterodimer of YFP/ABCG2 and E211Q may be able to hydrolyze ATP. Furthermore, the membrane vesicles containing both YFP/ABCG2 and E211Q exert approximately 79% of wt ABCG2-mediated methotrexate transport activity, implying that the heterodimer harboring YFP/ABCG2 and E211Q may be able to transport the anticancer drug methotrexate across the biological membranes.
CYP2B6 is mainly expressed in the liver that has been thought historically to play an insignificant role in human drug metabolism. However, increased interest in this enzyme has been stimulated by the discovery of polymorphic and ethnic differences in CYP2B6 expression, identification of additional substrates for CYP2B6, and evidence for co-regulation with CYP3A4. This paper updates our knowledge about the structure, function, regulation and polymorphism of CYP2B6. CYP2B6 can metabolise approximately 8% of clinically used drugs (n > 60), including cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, tamoxifen, ketamine, artemisinin, nevirapine, efavirenz, bupropion, sibutramine, and propofol. CYP2B6 is one of the CYP enzymes that bioactivate several procarcinogens and toxicants. This enzyme also metabolizes arachidonic acid, lauric acid, 17beta-estradiol, estrone, ethinylestradiol, and testosterone. Typical substrates of CYP2B6 are non-planar molecules, neutral or weakly basic, highly lipophilic with one or two hydrogen-bond acceptors. The crystal structure of CYP2B6 has not been resolved, while several pharmacophore and homology models of human CYP2B6 have been reported. Human CYP2B6 is closely regulated by constitutive androstane receptor (CAR/NR1I3) which can activate CYP2B6 expression upon ligand binding. Pregnane X receptor and glucocorticoid receptor also play a role in the regulation of CYP2B6. Induction of CYP2B6 may partially explain some clinical drug interactions observed. For example, coadministered carbamazepine decreases the systemic exposure of bupropion. There is a wide interindividual variability in the expression and activity of CYP2B6. Such a large variability is probably due to effects of genetic polymorphisms and exposure to drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of CYP2B6. To date, at least 28 allelic variants and some subvariants of CYP2B6 (*1B through *29) have been described and some of them have been shown to have important functional impact on drug clearance and drug response. For example, the efavirenz plasma levels in African-American subjects with the CYP2B6 homozygous 516T/T genotype are approximately 3-fold higher than individuals carrying the homozygous G/G genotype. The CYP2B6 516T/T genotype is associated with 1.7-fold greater plasma levels of nevirapine in HIV-infected patients. Smokers with the 1459C>T (R487C) variant of CYP2B6 may be more vulnerable to abstinence symptoms and relapse following treatment with bupropion as a smoking cessation agent. Further studies in the structure, function, regulation and polymorphism of CYP2B6 are warranted.
CYP1A2 is one of the major CYPs in human liver ( approximately 13%) and metabolises a variety of clinically important drugs, such as clozapine, lidocaine, theophylline, tacrine, and leflunomide. CYP1A2 is one of the major enzymes that bioactivate a number of procarcinogens and thus induction of CYP1A2 may increase the carcinogenicity of these compounds. This enzyme also metabolizes several important endogenous compounds including steroids, retinols, melatonin, uroporphyrinogen and arachidonic acid. In the recently published crystal structure of CYP1A2 in complex with alpha-naphthoflavone, its compact active site is closed without clear solvent or substrate access channels. Not surprisingly, CYP1A2 has a relatively small volume of the active site cavity of 375 A(3), which is 44.2% larger than that of CYP2A6 (260 A(3)), but much smaller than that of CYP3A4 (1385 A(3)) and 2C8 (1438 A(3)). Generally, CYP1A2 substrates contain planar ring that can fit the narrow and planar active site of the enzyme. Like many of other CYPs, CYP1A2 is subject to induction and inhibition by a number of compounds. Similar to CYP1A1 and 1B1, CYP1A2 is primarily regulated by the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor and a basic helix-loop-helix protein belonging to the Per-Arnt-Sim family of transcription factors. Knockout of Cyp1a2 in mice has provided a very useful tool for the functional investigation of this gene. Further studies are needed to explore the clinical and toxicological significance of CYP1A2.
CYP3A4 is the most important drug-metabolizing enzyme that is involved in biotransformation of more than 50% of drugs. Pregnane X receptor (PXR) dominantly controls CYP3A4 inducibility in the liver, whereas vitamin D receptor (VDR) transactivates CYP3A4 in the intestine by secondary bile acids. Four major functional PXR-binding response elements of CYP3A4 have been discovered and their cooperation was found to be crucial for maximal up-regulation of the gene in hepatocytes. VDR and PXR recognize similar response element motifs and share DR3(XREM) and proximal ER6 (prER6) response elements of the CYP3A4 gene. In this work, we tested whether the recently discovered PXR response elements DR4(eNR3A4) in the XREM module and the distal ER6 element in the CLEM4 module (CLEM4-ER6) bind VDR/RXRalpha heterodimer, whether the elements are involved in the intestinal transactivation, and whether their cooperation with other elements is essential for maximal intestinal expression of CYP3A4. Employing a series of gene reporter plasmids with various combinations of response element mutations transiently transfected into four intestinal cell lines, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP), we found that the CLEM4-ER6 motif interacts with VDR/RXRalpha heterodimer and partially cooperates with DR3(XREM) and prER6 in both basal and VDR-mediated inducible CYP3A4 regulation in intestinal cells. In contrast, eNR3A4 is involved only in the basal transactivation in intestinal cells and in the PXR-mediated rifampicin-induced transactivation of CYP3A4 in LS174T intestinal cells. We thus describe a specific ligand-induced VDR-mediated transactivation of the CYP3A4 gene in intestinal cells that differs from PXR-mediated CYP3A4 regulation in hepatocytes.
SLC26A7 (human)/Slc26a7 (mouse) is a recently identified chloride-base exchanger and/or chloride transporter that is expressed on the basolateral membrane of acid-secreting cells in the renal outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) and in gastric parietal cells. Here, we show that mice with genetic deletion of Slc26a7 expression develop distal renal tubular acidosis, as manifested by metabolic acidosis and alkaline urine pH. In the kidney, basolateral Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchange activity in acid-secreting intercalated cells in the OMCD was significantly decreased in hypertonic medium (a normal milieu for the medulla) but was reduced only mildly in isotonic medium. Changing from a hypertonic to isotonic medium (relative hypotonicity) decreased the membrane abundance of Slc26a7 in kidney cells in vivo and in vitro. In the stomach, stimulated acid secretion was significantly impaired in isolated gastric mucosa and in the intact organ. We propose that SLC26A7 dysfunction should be investigated as a potential cause of unexplained distal renal tubular acidosis or decreased gastric acid secretion in humans.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) is a tumor suppressor whose cellular regulation remains incompletely understood. We identified phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate RAC exchanger 2a (P-REX2a) as a PTEN-interacting protein. P-REX2a mRNA was more abundant in human cancer cells and significantly increased in tumors with wild-type PTEN that expressed an activated mutant of PIK3CA encoding the p110 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase subunit alpha (PI3Kalpha). P-REX2a inhibited PTEN lipid phosphatase activity and stimulated the PI3K pathway only in the presence of PTEN. P-REX2a stimulated cell growth and cooperated with a PIK3CA mutant to promote growth factor-independent proliferation and transformation. Depletion of P-REX2a reduced amounts of phosphorylated AKT and growth in human cell lines with intact PTEN. Thus, P-REX2a is a component of the PI3K pathway that can antagonize PTEN in cancer cells.
RBP1 is an important splicing factor involved in alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA of Drosophila sex-determining gene dsx. In this work, the Bombyx mori homologue of the rbp1 gene, Bmrbp1, was cloned. The pre-mRNA of Bmrbp1 gene is alternatively spliced to produce four mature mRNAs, named Bmrbp1-PA, Bmrbp1-PB, Bmrbp1-PC and Bmrbp1-PD, with nucleotide lengths of 799 nt, 1,316 nt, 894 nt and 724 nt, coding for 142 aa, 159 aa, 91 aa and 117 aa, respectively. BmRBP1-PA and BmRBP1-PD contain a N terminal RNA recognization motif (RRM) and a C terminal arginine/serine-rich domain, while BmRBP1-PB and BmRBP1-PC only share a RRM. Amino acid sequence alignments showed that BmRBP1 is conserved with its homologues in other insects and with other SR family proteins. The RT-PCR showed that Bmrbp1-PA was strongly expressed in all examined tissues and development stages, but Bmrbp1-PB was weakly expressed in these tissues and stages. The expression of both Bmrbp1-PA and Bmrbp1-PB showed no obvious sex difference. While the Bmrbp1-PC and Bmrbp1-PD were beyond detection by RT-PCR very likely due to their tissue/stage specificity. These results suggested that Bmrbp1 should be a member of SR family splicing factors, whether it is involved in the sex-specific splicing of Bmdsx pre-mRNA needs further research. 
GUCY2C is the intestinal receptor for the paracrine hormones guanylin and uroguanylin that converts guanosine-5'-triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). It functions as a tumor suppressor; its loss disrupts intestinal homeostasis and promotes tumorigenesis. We investigated the effects of GUCY2C loss on intestinal cell proliferation, metabolism, signaling, and tumorigenesis in mice.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is well characterized for its role in antagonizing the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway. Previous studies using size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated PTEN recruitment into high molecular mass complexes and hypothesized that PTEN phosphorylation status and PDZ binding domain may be required for such complex formation. In this study, we set out to test the structural requirements for PTEN complex assembly and identify the component(s) of the PTEN complex(es). Our results demonstrated that the PTEN catalytic function and PDZ binding domain are not absolutely required for its complex formation. On the other hand, PTEN phosphorylation status has a significant impact on its complex assembly. Our results further demonstrate enrichment of the PTEN complex in nuclear lysates, suggesting a mechanism through which PTEN phosphorylation may regulate its complex assembly. These results prompted further characterization of other protein components within the PTEN complex(es). Using size-exclusion chromatography and two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry analysis, we identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNP C) as a novel protein recruited to higher molecular mass fractions in the presence of PTEN. Further analysis indicates that endogenous hnRNP C and PTEN interact and co-localize within the nucleus, suggesting a potential role for PTEN, alongside hnRNP C, in RNA regulation.
CYP2D6 is a polymorphic gene. It has been observed to be deleted, to be duplicated and to undergo recombination events involving the CYP2D7 pseudogene and surrounding sequences. The objective of this study was to discover the genomic structure of CYP2D6 recombinants that interfere with clinical genotyping platforms that are available today.
"PTEN loss of function enhances proliferation, but effects on cellular energy metabolism are less well characterized. We used an inducible PTEN expression vector in a PTEN-null glioma cell line to examine this issue. While proliferation of PTEN-positive cells was insensitive to increases in glucose concentration beyond 2.5mM, PTEN-null cells significantly increased proliferation with increasing glucose concentration across the normal physiologic range to approximately 10mM, coinciding with a shift to glycolysis and ""glucose addiction"". This demonstrates that the impact of loss of function of PTEN is modified by glucose concentration, and may be relevant to epidemiologic results linking hyperglycemia to cancer risk and cancer mortality."
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that is either mutated or deleted in a number of human cancers. PTEN acts as a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway and thus plays an important role in cell fate, proliferation, growth, and migration. Recent evidence suggests that PTEN may also be involved in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as spinal cord injury (SCI). Overexpression of PTEN appears to cause inactivation/dephosphorylation of Akt in neurons, resulting in increased cell death. Given this newly discovered role for PTEN, it has been identified as a potential molecular target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against neurodegeneration. Motoneuron degeneration following SCI may occur due to up-regulation of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic cytokines including IFN-gamma. Exposure of VSC4.1 motoneurons to IFN-gamma (10 ng/ml) for 24 h resulted in significant overexpression of PTEN and decreased levels of activated Akt. Up-regulation of PTEN following IFN-gamma exposure was associated with decreased overall cell viability due to increased apoptosis, as assessed by Wright staining and analysis of cell death markers including Bax, Bcl-2, calpain activity, and caspase-3 activity, indicating a prominent role for PTEN in suppression of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway to promote motoneuron death. Addition of estrogen (100 nM) to VSC4.1 cells for 1 h prior to IFN-gamma exposure partially decreased PTEN expression, allowing adequate activation or phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt) to prevent apoptotic cell death. Thus, it appears that estrogen may mediate neuroprotection through decrease in PTEN expression. In conclusion, our studies suggest that PTEN inactivation may be used as an important parameter for evaluation of the efficacy of estrogen in prevention of neuronal loss in neurodegenerative disorders.
"CYP3A4 is an important determinant of drug-drug interactions. In this study, we evaluated whether cytochrome P450 3A knockout mice [Cyp3a(-/-)] and CYP3A4 transgenic (CYP3A4-Tg) mice can be used to study drug-drug interactions in the liver and intestine. Triazolam was used as a probe drug because it is a highly specific CYP3A substrate and not a P-glycoprotein substrate. Triazolam metabolism was profoundly reduced in Cyp3a(-/-) mice both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies revealed clear species differences in humans and mice, but triazolam metabolism in microsomes derived from CYP3A4-Tg ""humanized"" mice closely resembled that in human microsomes. It is interesting to note that studies with tissue-specific CYP3A4-Tg mice revealed that intestinal CYP3A4 has a major impact on oral triazolam exposure, whereas the effect of hepatic CYP3A4 was limited. To mimic a drug-drug interaction, we coadministered triazolam with the prototypical CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole, which increased triazolam exposure in all the CYP3A-proficient mouse strains but not in Cyp3a(-/-) mice. We further found that the anticancer drug gefitinib is a potent stimulator of 1'-OH triazolam formation in vitro. It is noteworthy that we could also show in vivo stimulation of triazolam metabolism by gefitinib, resulting in a lower oral triazolam exposure. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo example of direct stimulation of CYP3A4 activity after oral drug administration. Overall, this study illustrates how Cyp3a(-/-) and CYP3A4-Tg mice can be used to study drug-drug interactions. The data clarify that for drugs that are not P-glycoprotein substrates, intestinal metabolism also can be more important than hepatic metabolism after oral administration."
PDE10A is a member of the phosphodiesterase superfamily highly enriched within medium spiny neurons (MSN) in mammalian striatum. We have used inhibitors of PDE10A and quantitative measures of mRNA to demonstrate that PDE10A controls striatal gene expression by regulating MSN cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways. Acute treatment with PDE10A inhibitors produces rapid and transient transcription of the immediate early gene cfos in rat striatum. Although inhibition of PDE10A causes accumulation of both cAMP and cGMP, the increase in striatal cfos expression appears to depend on changes in cAMP, since the increase is present in mice deficient in nNOS which fail to increase cGMP in response to PDE10A inhibition. Consistent with its expression in a majority of striatal MSN, PDE10A inhibition significantly induces expression of both substance P and enkephalin, neuropeptide markers for the direct and indirect striatal output pathways, respectively. These findings support the hypothesis that PDE10A modulates signal transduction in both striatal output pathways and suggest that PDE10A inhibitors may offer a unique approach to the treatment of schizophrenia.
SPR imaging (SPRi) is at the forefront of optical label-free and real-time detection. It offers the possibility of monitoring hundreds of biological interactions simultaneously and from the binding profiles, allows the estimation of the kinetic parameters of the interactions between the immobilised probes and the ligands in solution. We review the current state of development of SPRi technology and its application including commercially available SPRi instruments. Attention is also given to surface chemistries for biochip functionalisation and suitable approaches to improve sensitivity.
"ABO is the most important blood group system in transfusion and transplantation practices. Glycosyltransferases are controlled by the ABO system which is helpful in building oligosaccharide structures on the cell surface of erythrocytes and vascular endothelium and in the exocrine secretion system, including the respiratory tract. We analyzed the ABO blood group of 200 children and adults with asthma as well as that of 2000 healthy subjects as controls. The most common blood group among the patients and controls was ""O"" (43.5% and 43.6%, respectively), followed by B, A, and AB. In the distribution of different blood groups, nonsignificant difference between patients and controls was observed (p = 0.931). We conclude that ABO blood group status has a nonsignificant association with asthma among the population of Mysore, Karnataka, South India."
CYP11B2 gene encodes a key enzyme for the production of aldosterone. Our aim is to investigate the association of -344T/C polymorphism with hypertension in Japanese men. The interaction between genotypes and dietary salt intake was also considered.
OTC deficiency, a partially dominant X-linked trait, is the most frequent inborn error of the urea cycle. We describe a female patient with a contiguous gene deletion syndrome encompassing the OTC, DMD, RPGR, CYBB and XK genes, amongst others, only manifesting features of OTC deficiency. Molecular characterization was ascertained by MLPA and confirmed by CGH microarray, which revealed an 8.7 Mb deletion of the X-chromosome. Complete de novo deletion of the OTC gene led to a severe clinical phenotype in the proband. The application of high resolution molecular genetic techniques such as MLPA and array CGH, in mutation negative OTC cases allows the identification of chromosomal rearrangements, such as large deletions and provides information for accurate genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.
ACP1 (acid phosphatase locus 1, a cytosolic low-molecular-weight phosphotyrosin phosphatase) and ADA1 (adenosine deaminase locus 1) are two polymorphic systems involved in immune reactions. Observed interactions at the biochemical and clinical levels between the two systems prompted this investigation of a possible interaction concerning susceptibility to type 1 diabetes.
CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, two members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of monooxygenases, mediate the biotransformation of a variety of xenobiotics. The two enzymes differ in substrate specificity and size and characteristics of the active site cavity. The aim of this study was to determine whether the catalytic properties of these isoforms, reflected by the differences observed from crystal structures and homology models, could be confirmed with experimental data. Detailed metabolite identification, reversible inhibition, and time-dependent inhibition were examined for levorphanol and levallorphan with CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. The studies were designed to provide a comparison of the orientations of substrates, the catalytic sites of the two enzymes, and the subsequent outcomes on metabolism and inhibition. The metabolite identification revealed that CYP3A4 catalyzed the formation of a variety of metabolites as a result of presenting different parts of the substrates to the heme. CYP2D6 was a poorer catalyst that led to a more limited number of metabolites that were interpreted in terms to two orientations of the substrates. The inhibition studies showed evidence for strong reversible inhibition of CYP2D6 but not for CYP3A4. Levallorphan acted as a time-dependent inhibitor on CYP3A4, indicating a productive binding mode with this enzyme not observed with CYP2D6 that presumably resulted from close interactions of the N-allyl moiety oriented toward the heme. All the results are in agreement with the large and flexible active site of CYP3A4 and the more restricted active site of CYP2D6.
IDH1 R132H mutations occur in approximately 70% of astrocytomas and oligodendroglial tumors. We developed a mouse monoclonal antibody targeting the IDH1 R132H mutation. Here, we show the high specificity and sensitivity of this antibody on Western blots and tissue sections from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor specimens. This antibody is highly useful for tumor classification, in detecting single infiltrating tumor cells and for the characterization of the cellular role of mutant IDH1 protein.
IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) mutations have been identified as early and frequent genetic alterations in astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas as well as secondary glioblastomas. In contrast, primary glioblastomas very rarely contain IDH1 mutations, although primary and secondary glioblastomas are histologically indistinguishable. The IDH1 mutations are remarkably specific to a single codon in the conserved and functionally important Arg132 in IDH1. In gliomas, the most frequent IDH1 mutations (>90%) were G395A (R132H). In this study, we immunized mice with R132H-containing IDH1 (IDH1(R132H)) peptide. After cell fusion using Sendai virus envelope, the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which specifically reacted with IDH1(R132H), were screened in ELISA. One of the mAbs, IMab-1 reacted with the IDH1(R132H) peptide, but not with wild type IDH1 (IDH1(wt)) peptide in ELISA. In Western-blot analysis, IMab-1 reacted with only the IDH1(R132H) protein, not IDH1(wt) protein or the other IDH1 mutants, indicating that IMab-1 is IDH1(R132H)-specific. Furthermore, IMab-1 specifically stained the IDH1(R132H)-expressing cells in astrocytomas in immunohistochemistry, whereas it did not react with IDH1(R132H)-negative primary glioblastoma sections. In conclusion, we established an anti-IDH1(R132H)-specific monoclonal antibody IMab-1, which should be significantly useful for diagnosis and biological evaluation of mutation-bearing gliomas.
CYP3A5 is an important genetic contributor to inter-individual differences in CYP3A-dependent clinically important drugs of metabolism and also of various endogenous compounds and environmental contaminants. The CYP3A5*3 allele results in a truncated protein with loss of CYP3A5 expression and CYP3A5*6 is associated with lower CYP3A5 catalytic activity. The polymorphism analysis was performed by PCR-RFLP and some representative cases by direct sequencing. Our case control study involved 183 consecutive North Indian CML patients in chronic phase of disease and 208 geographically and racially matched healthy controls. PCR-RFLP was carried out to determine the frequency of CYP3A5*3 and CYP3A5*6 genotypes. The relationship between these allelic variants and risk of CML was assessed by means of odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence limits calculated by logistic regression. The frequencies of CYP3A5*1/*1, CYP3A5*1/*3, and CYP3A5*3/*3 genotypes in CML and controls were examined, and the quantitative comparison of the frequency distributions between CML versus control were performed, showing no significant differences among these comparison pairs (P = 0.88, 0.65, and 0.80, respectively). However, we did not find the CYP3A5*6 allele in any of the controls and leukemia patients. It is concluded that there is no association of this polymorphism with the risk of chronic myeloid leukemia.
CYP2J2 is responsible for the production of 5,6 8,9 11,12 and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, vasodilator and anti-inflammatory substances. It is abundantly expressed in human heart and also present in kidney and vasculature. Carriers of a common polymorphism, the CYP2J2 -50G>T, rs890293, have reduced expression of CYP2J2 mRNA level in the heart putatively through the interference with a binding site for a transcription factor with consequently reduced circulating levels of CYP2J2 epoxygenase metabolites in vivo.
PTEN is one of the most commonly lost tumor suppressors in human cancer and is known to inhibit insulin signaling. Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have also been implicated in cancer formation and progression, and they have diverse functions, including nervous and vascular system development. We show that in C. elegans, the VAB-1 Eph kinase domain physically interacts with and phosphorylates PTEN (DAF-18), diminishing its protein levels and function. vab-1 mutants show increased longevity and sensitivity to dauer conditions, consistent with increased DAF-18/PTEN activity and decreased insulin-like signaling. Moreover, daf-18 mutations suppress vab-1 oocyte maturation phenotypes independent of PI3K signaling. We also present evidence that DAF-18 has protein phosphatase activity to antagonize VAB-1 action. Possible implications for human cancers are discussed, based on the idea that mutually inhibitory interactions between PTEN and Eph RTKs may be conserved.
CD36 participates in macrophage internalization of a variety of particles, and has been implicated in inflammatory responses to many of these ligands. To what extent CD36 cooperates with other receptors in mediating these processes remains unclear. Because CD36 has been shown to cooperate with TLR2, we investigated the roles and interactions of CD36 and TLRs in inflammation and phagocytosis. Using Ab-induced endocytosis of CD36 and phagocytosis of erythrocytes displaying Abs to CD36, we show that selective engagement and internalization of this receptor did not lead to proinflammatory cytokine production by primary human and murine macrophages. In addition, CD36-mediated phagocytosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria-parasitized erythrocytes (PEs), which contain parasite components that activate TLRs, also failed to induce cytokine secretion from primary macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CD36-mediated internalization did not require TLR2 or the TLR-signaling molecule IRAK4. However, macrophage pretreatment with TLR agonists markedly stimulated particle uptake via CD36. Similarly, PE uptake was unaffected by TLR deficiency, but in wild-type cells was increased by pretreatment with purified P. falciparum glycosylphosphatidylinositols, which activate TLR2. Our findings indicate that CD36 must cooperate with other receptors such as TLRs to participate in cytokine responses. Although purified P. falciparum components activate TLRs, CD36-mediated internalization of intact PEs is not inflammatory. Further, CD36 mediates internalization of particles, including PEs, independently of TLR signaling, but can functionally cooperate with TLRs to enhance internalization.
CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes predict therapeutic warfarin dose at initiation of therapy; however, the predictive ability of genetic information after a week or longer is unknown. Experts have hypothesized that genotype becomes irrelevant once international normalized ratio (INR) values are available because INR response reflects warfarin sensitivity.
"CP is a common feature of perinatal HIBD in the context of ""acute profound"" injury, and in this article, we have studied the possible anatomic substrates of dyskinesia. We have reviewed the extent of brain injury in children with dyskinetic and spastic CP due to acute profound hypoxia to identify sites of injury that explain why only some children develop movement disorders. It is known that the STN has a role in the development of movement disorders; therefore, we have specifically studied it."
CYP2C19 converts the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine to its active metabolite desipramine, which is subsequently inactivated by CYP2D6. The novel CYP2C19*17 allele causes ultrarapid metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates. We genotyped 178 depressed patients on imipramine for CYP2C19*17, and measured steady-state imipramine and desipramine plasma concentrations. Mean dose-corrected imipramine plasma concentration was significantly dependent on CYP2C19 genotype (Kruskal-Wallis test, P=0.01), with circa 30% lower levels in CYP2C19*17/*17 individuals compared with CYP2C19*1/*1 (wild-type) patients. The mean dose-corrected imipramine+desipramine plasma concentrations and imipramine/desipramine ratios were not significantly different between genotype subgroups (Kruskal-Wallis tests, P>or=0.12). In a multivariate analysis, we found a significant, but limited effect (P=0.035, eta(2)=0.031) of the CYP2C19*17 genotype on imipramine+desipramine concentrations. Although the CYP2C19*17 allele is associated with a significantly increased metabolism of imipramine, CYP2C19*17 genotyping will, in our view, not importantly contribute to dose management of patients on imipramine therapy guided by imipramine+desipramine plasma concentrations.
ASL TO4-ICU inpatients with hip fracture over 5 month-period were 45, 12 men and 33 women, average age 81. In 42 patients the fall was accidental or environment-related, and in 40 cases it occurred at home. More than 3 coexisting diseases were found in 22 patients (48%), and polipharmacotherapy with more than 3 drugs in 27 (60%). Only 4 (8%) patients presented a diagnosis of osteoporosis, and only one treated with antiosteoporotic drugs. Before the fracture occurred, 35 (77%) subjects walked without help; 28 (62%) were functionally independent, 17 (38%) dependent; cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 11 (24%) patients. Side-fracture was intracapsular in 17 (38%), extracapsular in 28 (62%). Surgery treatment was osteosinthesys in 26 (58%), endoprosthesis in 11 (24%), total hip prosthesis in 8 (18%). Surgery-timing was of 3 or more days in 23 (51%) patients. In the elderly osteoporosis is underdiagnosed and undertreated, and surgery of hip fracture is always delayed.
UGT1A4 is primarily expressed in the liver and exhibits catalytic activities for various drugs. Amongst the few UGT1A4 polymorphisms evaluated, studies support the alteration of UGT1A4-mediated glucuronidation by a few variations including the Pro²⁴Thr and Leu⁴⁸Val variants (referred to as UGT1A4*2 and *3).
CD36 is a membrane receptor with a wide variety of functions, including the regulation of energy metabolism, fat storage, and adipocyte differentiation. To assess the relationship between CD36 gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and obesity in adolescents, we evaluated the relationship between CD36 SNPs and the risk of obesity in a case-control study composed of 307 obese (age = 15.0 +/- 1.1 years) and 339 normal-weight adolescents (age = 14.6 +/- 1.1 years). To validate the results, we assessed the relation between the same SNPs and percentage of body fat (BF%) and BMI in 1,151 European adolescents (age = 14.8 +/- 1.4 years). SNPs with a minor allele frequency >0.10 were selected to tag CD36. Genotyping was performed on an Illumina system. Four SNPs (rs3211867, rs3211883, rs3211908, and rs1527483) were associated with increased risk of obesity in the case-control study (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval)): 1.96 (1.26-3.04], P = 0.003; 1.73 (1.16-2.59), P = 0.007; 2.42 (1.47-4.01), P = 0.0005 and 1.95 (1.25-3.05), P = 0.003, respectively). The same four SNPs were associated with higher BMI (P < 0.05) and BF% (P < 0.04) in the validation study. Further analyses identified a haplotype (frequency: 0.05) carrying the minor allele of these SNPs as being associated with obesity (OR: 2.28; P = 0.0008) in the case-control study and with excess adiposity (i.e., higher BF% (P = 0.03) and BMI (P = 0.04)) in the validation study. Our data suggest that genetic variability at the CD36 gene locus could be associated with body weight variability in European adolescents but these findings require replication.
SOD1 is an important gene related to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), and its effect is dependent on noise exposure levels.
PTEN is the second most mutated tumor suppressor gene other than p53. It suppresses tumorigenesis by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-biphosphate (PIP2), thereby directly inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-mediated tumorigenic activities. Consistent with this model of action, cytosolic PTEN is recruited to the plasma membrane to dephosphorylate PIP3. While nuclear PTEN has been shown to suppress tumorigenesis by governing genome integrity, additional mechanisms may also contribute to nuclear PTEN-mediated tumor suppression. The nuclear protein BMI1 promotes stem cell self-renewal and tumorigenesis and PTEN inhibits these events, suggesting that PTEN may suppress BMI1 function.
CYP1B1 mRNA is expressed constitutively in all normal extrahepatic human tissues, though the protein is usually undetectable. In contrast, CYP1B1 protein is expressed at high levels in tumors. In this study CYP1B1 mRNA and protein expression was measured in a panel of cell lines indicating that CYP1B1 regulation is altered in tumor cell lines in vitro. Interrogation of ONCOMINE revealed that CYP1B1 mRNA is not significantly overexpressed in tumors compared to normal tissues, suggesting CYP1B1 is subject to posttranscriptional control. Analysis of the CYP1B1 mRNA revealed a complex 5' untranslated region (UTR) containing a small upstream open-reading frame (uORF). These features are present in mRNAs subject to translational control so the effect of the 5'UTR was tested using in vitro translation in CHO-K1 cells. The 5'UTR significantly inhibited luciferase reporter gene translation, and mutation of the uORF start codon abolished the inhibitory effect. The 5'UTR also interacted with the microRNA-27b recognition element in the CYP1B1 mRNA 3'UTR to almost completely inhibit translation. CYP1B1 is subject to a high degree of translational control, which may explain the absence of protein expression in normal cells. Alterations in translational control during malignant transformation may help to explain the tumor-specific expression of CYP1B1 protein.
CD38 is a type II glycoprotein that is responsible for the synthesis and hydrolysis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), Ca(2+)-mobilizing second messengers. The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a critical event in hepatic fibrosis because these cells are the main producers of extracellular matrix proteins in the liver. Recent evidence indicates that the renin-angiotensin system plays a major role in liver fibrosis. In this study, we showed that angiotensin II (Ang II) evoked long lasting Ca(2+) rises and induced NAADP or cADPR productions via CD38 in HSCs. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate as well as NAADP-induced initial Ca(2+) transients were prerequisite for the production of cADPR, which was responsible for later sustained Ca(2+) rises in the Ang II-treated HSCs. Ang II-mediated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate- and NAADP-stimulated Ca(2+) signals cross-talked in a dependent manner with each other. We also demonstrated that CD38 plays an important role in Ang II-induced proliferation and overproduction of extracellular matrix proteins in HSCs, which were reduced by an antagonistic cADPR analog, 8-bromo-cADPR, or in CD38(-/-) HSCs. Moreover, we presented evidence to implicate CD38 in the bile duct ligation-induced liver fibrogenesis; infiltration of inflammatory cells and expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor-beta1, collagen alphaI(1), and fibronectin were reduced in CD38(-/-) mice compared with those in CD38(+/+) mice. These results demonstrate that CD38-mediated Ca(2+) signals contribute to liver fibrosis via HSCs activation, suggesting that intervention of CD38 activation may help prevent hepatic fibrosis.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor with dual protein and lipid-phosphatase activity, which is frequently deleted or mutated in many human advanced cancers. Recent studies have also demonstrated that PTEN is a promising target in type II diabetes and obesity treatment. Using C-terminal PTEN sequence in pEG202-NLS as bait, yeast two-hybrid screening on Mouse Embryo, Colon Cancer, and HeLa cDNA libraries was carried out. Isolated positive clones were validated by mating assay and identified through automated DNA sequencing and BLAST database searches. Sequence analysis revealed a number of PTEN-binding proteins linking this phosphatase to a number of different signaling cascades, suggesting that PTEN may perform other functions besides tumor-suppressing activity in different cell types. In particular, the interplay between PTEN function and adipocyte-specific fatty-acid-binding protein FABP4 is of notable interest. The demonstrable tautology of PTEN to FABP4 suggested a role for this phosphatase in the regulation of lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation. This interaction was further studied using coimmunoprecipitation and gel-filtration assays. Finally, based on Biacore assay, we have calculated the K(D) of PTEN-FABP4 complex, which is around 2.8 microM.
PTEN is a tumour suppressor with phosphatase activity in vitro against both lipids and proteins and other potential non-enzymatic mechanisms of action. Although the importance of PTEN's lipid phosphatase activity in regulating the PI3K signalling pathway is recognized, the significance of PTEN's other mechanisms of action is currently unclear. In this study, we describe the systematic identification of a PTEN mutant, PTEN Y138L, with activity against lipid, but not soluble substrates. Using this mutant, we provide evidence for the interfacial activation of PTEN against lipid substrates. We also show that when re-expressed at physiological levels in PTEN null U87MG glioblastoma cells, the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN is not required to regulate cellular PtdInsP(3) levels or the downstream protein kinase Akt/PKB. Finally, in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures of U87MG cells similarly re-expressing PTEN mutants, both the protein and lipid phosphatase activities were required to inhibit invasion, but either activity alone significantly inhibited proliferation, albeit only weakly for the protein phosphatase activity. Our data provide a novel tool to address the significance of PTEN's separable lipid and protein phosphatase activities and suggest that both activities suppress proliferation and together suppress invasion.
ABO incompatibility is not a barrier to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, the impact of an ABO mismatch on the outcome of the HSCT remains controversial. We analyzed whether ABO incompatibility leads to an increased risk of early/late complications, mortality, or increased transfusion requirements. The 147 consecutive allogeneic HSCTs includes 80 ABO-identical and 25 major, 30 minor, and 12 bidirectional ABO-mismatched grafts. The four groups were balanced with respect to disease status at transplantation. Transplantation-related mortality was significantly greater (P < .01) and overall survival significantly shorter (P = 0.2) among HSCT recipients with minor ABO-mismatched grafts. The relapse rate, progression-free survival, and transfusion requirements until discharge were not different between ABO-identical and ABO-mismatched groups. Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA); (P < .0001) and delayed red blood cell (RBC) engraftment (P < .001) were more frequent in HSCT recipients with major mismatched donors. Delayed RBC engraftment was associated with posttransplantation hyperferritininemia and increased mortality risk (P = .05). The greater frequency of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients with minor mismatched transplants, did not show statistical significance. In contrast severe GVHD was significantly more frequent among minor mismatched patients (P = .04). ABO-mismatched HSCT might have an unfavorable impact on transplant outcomes. Selection of ABO-compatible donors when possible, strategies to prevent and treat PRCA, modifications in transfusion practice, and effective iron chelation are among the measures that can improve transplant outcomes.
CYP4F22 and CYP4F8 are expressed in epidermis, and mutations of CYP4F22 are associated with lamellar ichthyosis. Epoxyalcohols (HEETs) and epoxides (EETs) of 20:4n-6 appear to be important for the water permeability barrier of skin. Our aim was to study the MS/MS spectra and fragmentation of these compounds and to determine whether they were oxidized by CYP4F22 or CYP4F8 expressed in yeast. HEETs were prepared from 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE), 12-HPETE, and their [(2)H(8)]labeled isotopomers, and separated by normal phase-HPLC with MS/MS analysis. CYP4F22 oxygenated 20:4n-6 at C-18, whereas metabolites of HEETs could not be identified. CYP4F8 formed omega3 hydroxy metabolites of HEETs derived from 12R-HPETE with 11,12-epoxy-10-hydroxy configuration, but not HEETs derived from 15S-HPETE. 8,9-EET and 11,12-EET were also subject to omega3 hydroxylation by CYP4F8. We conclude that CYP4F8 and CYP4F22 oxidize 20:4n-6 and that CYP4F8 selectively oxidizes 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, and 10,11R,12R-HEET at the omega3 position.
PDE10A inhibition has generated much excitement as a potential novel mechanism for the treatment of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. PDE10A is only '10 years old' as a drug discovery target since it was first discovered in 1999, and thus PDE10A is an example of the modern drug discovery paradigm demonstrating the highly increased speed by which novel targets can be validated, hits identified, lead-optimization performed and compounds progressed into clinical trials. At least one PDE10A inhibitor compound has been progressed to clinical Phase II for the treatment of schizophrenia. And preclinical evidence suggests that a PDE10A inhibitor could provide antipsychotic, pro-cognitive and negative symptom efficacy in the same dose range.
PIP5KL1 (phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase-like 1), the fourth member of PIP5Ks (phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases) type I, acts as a scaffold for localization and activation of PIP5Ks, which in turn regulate numerous cellular processes. However, the role of PIP5KL1 in the development of human cancer is poorly studied. In this study, we established a stable clone of PIP5KL1 overexpressing human cervical cancer HeLa cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) and Western immunoblot analysis were performed to testify the mRNA and protein levels of PIP5KL1 in HeLa cells. The effect of PIP5KL1 overexpression on in vitro cell growth was assessed by measuring cell proliferation and migration. The athymic nude mouse model was used to examine the effects of PIP5KL1 on tumour growth in vivo. Stable transfection of PIP5KL1 induced a significant increase in expression of both mRNA and protein levels and consequent robust inhibition of proliferation (P<0.05) and migration (P<0.05) of HeLa cells. Overexpression of PIP5KL1 significantly suppressed the growth of HeLa xenograft tumours in the flanks of nude mice. Taken together, these studies indicate a functional negative correlation between elevated levels of PIP5KL1 and the development of human cervical cancer, suggesting that PIP5KL1 overexpression may suppress cervical cancer formation.
SCD is characterized by hemolysis and oxidative stress, resulting in endothelial dysfunction (EDF). Peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT), a noninvasive technology for measuring EDF, utilizes reactive hyperemia following mini-ischemic stress (reactive hyperemia index or RHI).
UCP3 (uncoupling protein 3) and its homologues UCP2 and UCP1 are regulators of mitochondrial function. UCP2 is known to have a short half-life of approx. 1 h, owing to its rapid degradation by the cytosolic 26S proteasome, whereas UCP1 is turned over much more slowly by mitochondrial autophagy. In the present study we investigate whether UCP3 also has a short half-life, and whether the proteasome is involved in UCP3 degradation. UCP3 half-life was examined in the mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line by inhibiting protein synthesis with cycloheximide and monitoring UCP3 protein levels by immunoblot analysis. We show that UCP3 has a short half-life of 0.5-4 h. Rapid degradation was prevented by a cocktail of proteasome inhibitors, supporting a proteasomal mechanism for turnover. In addition, this phenotype is recapitulated in vitro: UCP3 was degraded in mitochondria isolated from rat skeletal muscle or brown adipose tissue with a half-life of 0.5-4 h, but only in the presence of a purified 26S proteasomal fraction. This in vitro proteolysis was also sensitive to proteasome inhibition. This phenotype is in direct contrast with the related proteins UCP1 and the adenine nucleotide translocase, which have long half-lives. Therefore UCP3 is turned over rapidly in multiple cell types in a proteasome-dependent manner.
ACE inhibitors (ACEi) reduce renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis but are not completely effective. Combined extract of Astragalus membranaceus and Angelica sinensis (A&A) is a traditional antifibrotic agent in China. The present investigation aimed to determine whether an ACEi (Enalapril) and A&A together have a better antifibrotic effect in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) than monotherapy with either agent. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 4 per group) had either sham operation or UUO alone, with A&A (combined aqueous and ethanol extract equivalent to 2.1 g dried herbs), with Enalapril (in drinking water at 200 mg/mL) or with both treatments. Kidney and liver were collected for protein extraction or fixed for histologic stains, immunohistochemistry (IHC), microscopy. Enalapril or A&A individually were antifibrotic. Transforming growth factor-beta1, fibroblast activation, collagen deposition, macrophage accumulation and tubular cell apoptosis were all decreased. The combination of the two drugs was significantly more effective than Enalapril alone in reducing tumor necrosis factor-alpha, collagen accumulation, activation of fibroblasts, and tubular cell apoptosis. In conclusion, Enalapril with A&A significantly decreased tubulointerstitial fibrosis to a greater extent than treatment with Enalapril alone. Further studies focusing on the isolation of the active constituents of A&A and the clinical application of the combination of ACEi plus A&A are warranted to determine the value of this treatment in humans.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is a lipid phosphatase that functions as a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. The present study sought to examine in depth the interaction between PTEN and eNOS activity. Co-expression of eNOS and PTEN in COS-7 cells significantly decreased NO production compared to eNOS alone, while co-expression of eNOS and the dominant negative mutant PTEN(C124A) significantly increased NO production. Upon examination of the putative eNOS phosphorylation sites, phosphorylation of S116, T497, S617, S635 and S1179 was decreased by PTEN co-expression, while the dominant negative PTEN(C124A) produced an increase in phosphorylation of all sites except S116 and S635. A myristoylation-deficient eNOS construct with little dependence on phosphorylation state (G2AeNOS) was not significantly affected by co-expression with either PTEN or PTEN(C124A). Likewise, an eNOS construct with a triple phospho-null mutation (S617A, S635A and S1179A) was also unaffected by co-expression with either PTEN or PTEN(C124A). Purified PTEN or PTEN(C124A) failed to interact with purified eNOS in vitro, arguing against a direct interaction between PTEN and eNOS. When the PTEN constructs were expressed in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), PTEN significantly decreased NO production and PTEN(C124A) increased it, and both S617 and S1179 were altered by co-expression with the PTEN constructs. Increased expression of PTEN in endothelial cells did not influence superoxide production. We conclude that PTEN is a regulator of eNOS function both when expressed in COS-7 cells and in human endothelial cells, and does so via its effects on the PI3K/Akt pathway.
CYP2C9 is an important drug-metabolizing enzyme that metabolizes, e.g., warfarin, antidiabetics, and antiphlogistics. However, the endogenous regulation of this enzyme is largely unknown. In this study, we examined the role of GATA transcription factors in the gene expression of CYP2C9. We investigated four putative GATA binding sites within the first 200 base pairs of CYP2C9 promoter at the positions I: -173/-170, II: -167/-164, III: -118/-115, and IV: -106/-103. Luciferase activity driven by a wild-type CYP2C9 promoter construct was strongly up-regulated in Huh-7 cells upon cotransfection with expression plasmids for GATA-2 and GATA-4, whereas mutations introduced into GATA binding site III or I and II reduced this induction to a significant extent. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed specific binding of GATA-4 and GATA-6 to the oligonucleotides containing GATA binding sites I and II. Furthermore, the association of GATA-4 with CYP2C9 promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in HepG2 cells. Taken together, these data strongly suggest an involvement of liver-specific transcription factor GATA-4 in the transcriptional regulation of CYP2C9.
CFTR is a highly regulated apical chloride channel of epithelial cells that is mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF). In this study, we characterized the apical stability and intracellular trafficking of wild-type and mutant CFTR in its native environment, i.e., highly differentiated primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures. We labeled the apical pool of CFTR and subsequently visualized the protein in intracellular compartments. CFTR moved from the apical surface to endosomes and then efficiently recycled back to the surface. CFTR endocytosis occurred more slowly in polarized than in nonpolarized HAE cells or in a polarized epithelial cell line. The most common mutation in CF, DeltaF508 CFTR, was rescued from endoplasmic reticulum retention by low-temperature incubation but transited from the apical membrane to endocytic compartments more rapidly and recycled less efficiently than wild-type CFTR. Incubation with small-molecule correctors resulted in DeltaF508 CFTR at the apical membrane but did not restore apical stability. To stabilize the mutant protein at the apical membrane, we found that the dynamin inhibitor Dynasore and the cholesterol-extracting agent cyclodextrin dramatically reduced internalization of DeltaF508, whereas the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 completely blocked endocytosis of DeltaF508. On examination of intrinsic properties of CFTR that may affect its apical stability, we found that N-linked oligosaccharides were not necessary for transport to the apical membrane but were required for efficient apical recycling and, therefore, influenced the turnover of surface CFTR. Thus apical stability of CFTR in its native environment is affected by properties of the protein and modulation of endocytic trafficking.
WWOX (WW domain-containing oxidoreductase) is the gene mapping at FRA16D HSA16q23.1, the second most active common fragile site in the human genome. In this study we characterized at a detailed molecular level WWOX in the bovine genome. First, we sequenced cDNA from various tissues and obtained evidence in support of a 9-exon structure for the gene, similar to the human gene. Then, we recovered BACs using exon tags and annotated the gene to a >1-Mb genomic region of BTA18 using the Btau 4.0 genome assembly as a reference, thus resolving an issue related to exon 9, which is not included in the genomic annotation of the gene in the Entrez database. Finally, BACs spanning WWOX were used as FISH probes to obtain comparative mapping of the gene in Bos taurus, Bubalus bubalis, Ovis aries and Capra hircus to BTA18q12.1, BBU18q13, OAR14q12.1 and CHI18q12.1, respectively. Our data show that the chromosomal location of WWOX is conserved between man and 4 major domesticated species. Moreover, the annotation of the bovine gene also suggests a highly conserved genomic arrangement, including number and size of introns.
ABCG2 is an efflux transporter conferring multidrug resistance (MDR) on cancer cells. However, the initial molecular events leading to its up-regulation in MDR tumor cells are poorly understood. Herein, we explored the impact of drug treatment on the methylation status of the ABCG2 promoter and consequent reactivation of ABCG2 gene expression in parental tumor cell lines and their MDR sublines. We demonstrate that ABCG2 promoter methylation is common in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) lines, also present in primary T-ALL lymphoblast specimens. Furthermore, drug selection with sulfasalazine and topotecan induced a complete demethylation of the ABCG2 promoter in the T-ALL and ovarian carcinoma model cell lines CCRF-CEM and IGROV1, respectively. This resulted in a dramatic induction of ABCG2 messenger RNA levels (235- and 743-fold, respectively) and consequent acquisition of an ABCG2-dependent MDR phenotype. Quantitative genomic polymerase chain reaction and ABCG2 promoter-luciferase reporter assay did not reveal ABCG2 gene amplification or differential transcriptional trans-activation, which could account for ABCG2 up-regulation in these MDR cells. Remarkably, mimicking cytotoxic bolus drug treatment through 12- to 24-hour pulse exposure of ABCG2-silenced leukemia cells, to clinically relevant concentrations of the chemotherapeutic agents daunorubicin and mitoxantrone, resulted in a marked transcriptional up-regulation of ABCG2. Our findings establish that antitumor drug-induced epigenetic reactivation of ABCG2 gene expression in cancer cells is an early molecular event leading to MDR. These findings have important implications for the emergence, clonal selection, and expansion of malignant cells with the MDR phenotype during chemotherapy.
CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotyping has been advocated as a means of improving the accuracy of warfarin dosing. However, the effectiveness of genotyping in improving anticoagulation control and reducing major bleeding has not yet been compellingly demonstrated. Genotyping currently costs $400 to $550.
ABCG2 is a half-size ATP-binding cassette transporter implicated in cellular gefitinib transport. Reportedly, the c.421C > A ABCG2 gene polymorphism was associated with gefitinib-induced diarrhea in Caucasian patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Since c.421C > A ABCG2, resulting in p.Q141K substitution, is more prevalent in Asian populations, the putative relationship between gefitinib-induced adverse effects and this functional polymorphism was investigated in Japanese patients. c.376C > T, resulting in truncated, non-functional ABCG2, was also investigated.
ABO and Rhesus (Rh) blood group antigens are hereditary characters and are useful in population genetic studies, in resolving medico-legal issues and more importantly in compatibility test in blood transfusion practice. Data on frequency distribution of ABO and Rh-D in Niger-Delta region of Nigeria are not available; hence we made an attempt to retrospectively analyze the records on the blood donors, transfusion recipients and patients attending antenatal care or some other medical interventions. Over a twenty-year period between 1986 and 2005, a total of 160,431 blood samples were grouped for ABO and Rh-D at the blood bank of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria. Blood group distribution among these samples showed phenotypes A, B, AB and O as 23.72%, 20.09%, 2.97% and 53.22%, respectively. The Rh-D negative phenotype was found among 6.01% of the samples tested.
ABO blood group iso-antibodies are naturally occurring antibodies found in serum and other body fluids.
CYP2C19 is a polymorphic enzyme which metabolizes several clinically important drugs including proguanil. Variation in the 5' regulatory region may influence CYP2C19 activity. This study evaluates the relationship between proguanil metabolic ratio and genetic variations of CYP2C19 in a South Indian population. Fifty unrelated healthy subjects were genotyped for CYP2C19 (*)2 and (*)3 alleles and the 5' flanking region of CYP2C19 was sequenced. Plasma concentrations of proguanil and cycloguanil were estimated by reverse phase HPLC after single oral doses (200 mg) of proguanil. In silico docking analysis of transcription factors binding to its sites in CYP2C19 5' regulatory region was performed. The mean metabolic ratios (proguanil/cycloguanil) were highest in (*)1/(*)2 or (*)1/(*)3 subjects and in (*)2/(*)2 or (*)2/(*)3 as compared to (*)1/(*)1 subjects. Subjects with promoter region variation -98T>C showed decrease in the metabolic ratios irrespective of other variation, which may explain the deviation from the genotype-phenotype association of CYP2C19. In silico analysis predicted alteration in the interaction of transcription factors to their binding sites in the presence of variant alleles. The results of this study would be useful in predicting interindividual differences in the metabolism of substrates of CYP2C19.
CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is a cAMP-activated chloride channel that regulates electrolyte and water transport. The present study investigated the expression and localization of CFTR in human gingiva and explored the possible association of CFTR with periodontal conditions. CFTR expression in gingival biopsies from five periodontally healthy subjects and ten subjects with chronic periodontitis and in the RHGE (reconstituted human gingival epithelia) was detected by immunohistochemistry, whereas its expression in gingival biopsies was analysed by immunofluorescence staining. CFTR mRNA was analysed by reverse transcription-PCR. CFTR mRNA was detected in human gingival epithelia and RHGE. CFTR protein was detected in gingival biopsies from both healthy subjects and individuals with periodontitis and in RHGE. In healthy subjects, CFTR expression was mainly confined to the granular and spinous layers of epithelia and localized on the cell membrane. In patients with periodontitis, CFTR was detected in all layers of epithelia and the underlying connective tissues. The mean CFTR expression levels in periodontitis patients were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects. The present study for the first time showed the expression and localization of CFTR in human gingival epithelia. Elevated CFTR expression in periodontitis subjects implies the possible involvement of CFTR in periodontal disease pathogenesis. Further study is warranted to confirm the present findings.
PHOSPHO1 is a bone-specific phosphatase implicated in the initiation of inorganic phosphate generation for matrix mineralization. The control of mineralization is attributed to the actions of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). However, matrix vesicles (MVs) containing apatite crystals are present in patients with hypophosphatasia as well as TNAP null (Akp2(-/-)) mice. It is therefore likely that other phosphatases work with TNAP to regulate matrix mineralization. Although PHOSPHO1 and TNAP expression is associated with MVs, it is not known if PHOSPHO1 and TNAP are coexpressed during the early stages of limb development. Furthermore, the functional in vivo role of PHOSPHO1 in matrix mineralization has yet to be established. Here, we studied the temporal expression and functional role of PHOSPHO1 within chick limb bud mesenchymal micromass cultures and also in wild-type and talpid(3) chick mutants. These mutants are characterized by defective hedgehog signalling and the absence of endochondral mineralization. The ability of in vitro micromass cultures to differentiate and mineralize their matrix was temporally associated with increased expression of PHOSPHO1 and TNAP. Comparable changes in expression were noted in developing embryonic legs (developmental stages 23-36HH). Micromass cultures treated with lansoprazole, a small-molecule inhibitor of PHOSPHO1 activity, or FGF2, an inhibitor of chondrocyte differentiation, resulted in reduced alizarin red staining (P<0.05). FGF2 treatment also caused a reduction in PHOSPHO1 (P<0.001) and TNAP (P<0.001) expression. Expression analysis by whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization correlated with qPCR micromass data and demonstrated the existence of a tightly regulated pattern of Phospho1 and Tnap expression which precedes mineralization. Treatment of developing embryos for 5 days with lansoprazole completely inhibited mineralization of all leg and wing long bones as assessed by alcian blue/alizarin red staining. Furthermore, long bones of the talpid(3) chick mutant did not express Phospho1 or Tnap whereas flat bones mineralized normally and expressed both phosphatases. In conclusion, this study has disclosed that PHOSPHO1 expression mirrors that of TNAP during embryonic bone development and that PHOSPHO1 contributes to bone mineralization in developing chick long bones.
CD36 is a macrophage scavenger receptor mediating the uptake of modified lipoproteins, whereas the ABCA1 transporter counteracts this effect by mediating cellular lipid efflux. Based on a DNA microarray, we previously found that the CD36 and ABCA1 genes were overexpressed in symptom-causing carotid plaques (CP) compared with nonsymptom-causing CP. To evaluate their role in CP destabilization, we conducted detailed immunohistochemical studies on the localization of lipids, CD36 and ABCA1 proteins, extravasated red blood cells, and atheromatous/necrotic tissue.
WWOX is a bona fide tumour suppressor, with hypomorphic and knockout mouse models exhibiting increased tumour susceptibility. In ovarian cancer cells WWOX transfection abolishes tumourigenicity, suppresses tumour cell adhesion to extracellular matrix and induces apoptosis in non-adherent cells. One-third of ovarian tumours show loss of WWOX expression, and this loss significantly associates with clear cell and mucinous histology, advanced stage, low progesterone receptor expression and poor survival, suggesting that WWOX status affects ovarian cancer progression and prognosis. Genetic variation in other tumour suppressors (e.g. p53 and XPD) is reported to modify cancer progression/outcome, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the WWOX gene are reported to associate with prostate cancer risk. We previously identified polymorphic variants within WWOX, some of which have potential to affect its expression. We therefore examined a cancer modifier role for these WWOX variants. Eight SNPs, based upon location, frequency and potential to affect WWOX expression, were genotyped in 554 ovarian cancer patients (CGP samples), and associations with pathological and survival data were examined. The CGP samples demonstrated significant associations after Bonferroni correction between Isnp1 and both tumour grade (p(corr)=0.033) and histology (p(corr)=0.046), Isnp8 and tumour grade (p(corr)=0.032) and T1497G and progression-free survival (p(corr)=0.037). None of these positive associations were confirmed in an independent ovarian cancer population (Scotroc1 samples, n=863). While these results may suggest that the associations are false positives, differences between the two populations cannot be excluded, and thus highlight the challenges in validation studies.
ABCG2 is an ATP-binding cassette half-transporter important in normal tissue protection, drug distribution, and excretion. ABCG2 requires homodimerization for function, though the mechanism for dimerization has not been elucidated. We conducted mutational analysis of threonine 402, three residues from the GXXXG motif in TM1, to study its potential role in ABCG2 dimerization (TXXXGXXXG). Single mutations to leucine (T402L) or arginine (T402R) did not have a significant impact on the ABCG2 protein. On the other hand, combining the T402 mutations with the GXXXG glycine to leucine mutations (T402L/G406L/G410L and T402R/G406L/G410L) resulted in a substantially reduced level of expression, altered glycosylation, degradation by a proteosome-independent pathway, and partial retention in the endoplasmic reticulum as suggested by immunostaining, Endo H sensitivity, and MG132 and bafilomycin failed effect. The T402L/G406L/G410L mutant when incubated with the ABCG2 substrate MX showed a shift on immunoblot analysis to the band representing the fully mature glycoprotein. The T402R/G406L/G410L mutant carrying the more drastic substitution was found to primarily localize intracellularly. The same set of mutations also displayed impaired dimerization in the TOXCAT assay for TM1 compared to that of the wild type. Homology modeling of ABCG2 places the TXXXGXXXG motif at the dimer interface. These studies are consistent with a role for the extended TXXXGXXXG motif in ABCG2 folding, processing, and/or dimerization.
CYP2E1 is one of a superfamily of enzymes that play a central role in activating and detoxifying many xenobiotics and endogenous compounds thought to be involved in the development of several human diseases. Among other factors, individual susceptibility to developing these pathologies relies on genetic polymorphisms, which are related to ethnic differences, since the frequency of mutant genotypes varies in different populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic basis of CYP2E1 polymorphisms in the populations of four different geographical locations of China. Twenty-two different CYP2E1 polymorphisms, including six novel variants in promoter regions and a novel nonsense mutation, were identified. The frequencies of some polymorphisms and genotypes demonstrated significant differences among the four populations. Linkage disequilibrium analysis and tag SNP selection were performed. Haplotypes were analyzed within the selected tag SNPs. Tag SNP selection and haplotype distributions showed differences across the four populations.
LPIN1 is the phosphatidic acid phosphatase that produces 1,2-diacylglycerol, and thus it is related to the synthesis of triglycerides in the adipocyte. LPIN1 has a role in lipid synthesis and nuclear receptor coactivation, both of which may be involved in lipid homeostasis and metabolism. Among others, hypoxia and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are being shown to be related to the adipose dysfunction found in human obesity.
PTEN mutations are frequently found in malignant glioma and can result in activated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt survival signaling associated with resistance to radiotherapy. Strategies to interfere with aberrant PI3K/Akt activity are therefore being developed to improve the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy in patients with malignant glioma. The methylxanthine caffeine has been described as a PI3K inhibitor and is also known to sensitize cells to ionizing radiation. However, a direct association between these two caffeine-mediated effects has not been reported yet. Therefore, we asked whether caffeine or its derivative pentoxifylline differentially affect the radiosensitivity of malignant gliomas with different PTEN status. As models, we used the radiosensitive EA14 malignant glioma cell line containing wild-type PTEN and the radioresistant U87MG malignant glioma cell line harboring mutant PTEN. Our study revealed that caffeine and pentoxifylline radiosensitized PTEN-deficient but not PTEN-proficient glioma cells. Radiosensitization of PTEN-deficient U87MG cells by caffeine was significantly correlated with the activation of the G(1) DNA damage checkpoint that occurred independently of de novo synthesis of p53 and p21. The p53 independency was also confirmed by a significant caffeine-mediated radiosensitization of the glioma cell lines T98G and U373MG that are deficient for both PTEN and p53. Furthermore, caffeine-mediated radiosensitization was associated with the inhibition of Akt hyperphosphorylation in PTEN-deficient cells to a level comparable with PTEN-proficient cells. Our data suggest that the methylxanthine caffeine or its derivative pentoxifylline are promising candidate drugs for the radiosensitization of glioma cells particularly with PTEN mutations.
SDHC E69 cells, which overproduce superoxide anions in their mitochondria, were previously established that had a mutation in the SDHC gene of complex II of the respiratory chain. We now demonstrate that tumors formed by NIH 3T3 and SDHC E69 cells showed significant histological differences. Cytoplasmic cytochrome c release from mitochondria was significantly elevated in SDHC E69 cells and was likely caused by superoxide anion overproduction from mitochondria. In addition, the p53 and Ras signal transduction pathways were activated by oxidative stress and may play a key role in the supernumerary apoptosis in SDHC E69 cells. Our results suggest that the development and growth characteristics of hereditary paragangliomas, which are defective in the same complex of electron transport as mouse SDHC E69 cells, may be caused by apoptosis induction by mitochondrial oxidative stress.
ACE was applied to the quantitative evaluation of noncovalent binding interactions between benzo-18-crown-6-ether (B18C6) and several alkali metal ions, Li(+), Na(+), K(+), Rb(+) and Cs(+), in a mixed binary solvent system, methanol-water (50/50 v/v). The apparent binding (stability) constants (K(b)) of B18C6-alkali metal ion complexes in the hydro-organic medium above were determined from the dependence of the effective electrophoretic mobility of B18C6 on the concentration of alkali metal ions in the BGE using a nonlinear regression analysis. Before regression analysis, the mobilities measured by ACE at ambient temperature and variable ionic strength of the BGE were corrected by a new procedure to the reference temperature, 25 degrees C, and the constant ionic strength, 10 mM. In the 50% v/v methanol-water solvent system, like in pure methanol, B18C6 formed the strongest complex with potassium ion (log K(b)=2.89+/-0.17), the weakest complex with cesium ion (log K(b)=2.04+/-0.20), and no complexation was observed between B18C6 and the lithium ion. In the mixed methanol-water solvent system, the binding constants of the complexes above were found to be about two orders lower than in methanol and about one order higher than in water.
CYP2C9 enzymes are important in the metabolism of procarcinogenic chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found in tobacco smoke. Two functional variants in the CYP2C9 gene (CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3) are known to be associated with decreased enzyme activity towards tolbutamide and warfarin, while this has not been investigated for PAHs. We hypothesised that these two variants in the CYP2C9 gene influence risk of tobacco-related cancer.
TM7SF2 gene encodes 3beta-hydroxysterol Delta(14)-reductase, responsible for the reduction of C14-unsaturated sterols in cholesterol biosynthesis. TM7SF2 gene expression is controlled by cell sterol levels through the SREBP-2. The motifs of TM7SF2 promoter responsible for activation by SREBP-2 have not been characterized. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and mutation analysis, we identified a new SRE motif, 60% identical to an inverted SRE-3, able to bind SREBP-2 in vitro and in vivo. Co-transfection of promoter-luciferase reporter constructs in HepG2 cells showed that the binding of SREBP-2 to SRE produced approximately 26-fold promoter activation, whereas mutation of the SRE motif caused a dramatic decrease of transactivation by SREBP-2. The function of additional motifs that bind transcription factors cooperating with SREBP-2 was investigated. An inverted CCAAT-box, that binds nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), cooperates with SREBP-2 in TM7SF2 promoter activation. Deletion of this motif resulted in the loss of promoter induction by sterol starvation in HepG2 cells, as well as a decrease in fold activation by SREBP-2 in co-transfection experiments. Moreover, co-transfection of the promoter with a plasmid expressing dominant negative NF-YA did not permit full activation by SREBP-2. Three GC-boxes (1, 2, 3), known to bind Sp1 transcription factor, were also investigated. The mutagenesis of each of them produced a decrease in SREBP-2-dependent activation, the most powerful being GC-box2. A triple mutagenized promoter construct did not have an additive effect. We conclude that, besides the SRE motif, both the inverted CCAAT-box and GC-box2 are essential for full promoter activation by SREBP-2.
UGT2B4 is a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) superfamily, a major detoxifying system in humans. UGT2B4 is involved in bile acids metabolism and highly expressed in liver and extrahepatic tissues. The aim of this study was to uncover new molecular mechanisms underlying interindividual variability in the UGT2B4 pathway.
OAT randomised patients with an occluded infarct artery three to 28 days after myocardial infarction (MI). The study demonstrated that PCI did not reduce the occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of death, re-MI, and New York Heart Association class IV heart failure in comparison with patients assigned to optimal medical therapy alone (MED). In view of prior literature in similar cohorts showing fewer sudden cardiac deaths and less left ventricular (LV) remodelling, but excess re-MI with PCI, causes of death were analysed in more detail.
UCP2 -866G>A (rs659366) has been implicated in cardiometabolic disease and represents a novel candidate gene for beta-blocker response, particularly among patients with diabetes. We assessed the function of -866G>A and its role as a modifier of beta-blocker treatment outcomes by diabetes status in an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) cohort.
STS is the single enzyme that converts all steroid sulfates into their free steroid forms. Initiation of attack behavior against conspecific male mice appeared to be linked to Sts. Here we have confirmed the role of Sts through an association study with attack behavior. Previous studies indicated a positive correlation between the initiation of attack behavior and liver STS concentration levels in male mice, but this finding was not compatible with established knowledge of STS mechanisms. High STS concentrations induce low concentrations of sulfated steroids. Sulfated and un-sulfated steroids are GABA(A) receptor agonists and NMDA receptor positive allosteric modulators. This synaptic pattern of functioning can generate attack behavior and we have confirmed here that an injection of the sulfated steroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) increases attack behavior. To solve the paradox, we measured the transcription activity of the genes underlying the pathways involved in the hydrolysis of sulfated steroids and leading to the formation of un-conjugated steroids in the mouse brain. We observed that the genes monitoring the steroid biosynthesis pathways exhibited a transcription pattern resulting in an increased sulfotransferase activity in the attacking males that could counterbalance the de-sulfating activity of Sts in the attacking mice.
CAD is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients; we need reliable clinical parameters to stratify cardiovascular risk in these patients. We thus assessed prognostic value of clinical parameters, rest and stress echocardiographic data in diabetic patients, with known or suspected CAD. We studied 322 type 2 diabetic patients, who underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) for known or suspected CAD; for prognostic assessment, end-points were all-cause mortality and hard cardiac events (cardiac death and non fatal myocardial infarction). During DSE, viability and inducible ischemia developed in 65 (20%) and 192 (60%) subjects, respectively; a severe ischemia (an asynergic area including more than 40% of all segments combined with a rate pressure product < 17,000) appeared in 88 (27%). Presence of a diabetic treatment or microvascular diabetic complications didn't influence prognosis, while a longer diabetes duration was associated with a higher all-cause mortality at univariate analysis. At multivariate analysis, an advanced age (RR = 1.108, CI: 1.039-1.182, P = 0.002), a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (RR = 0.956, CI: 0.919-0.994, P = 0.025) and, tendentially, peripheral vascular disease (RR = 2.942, CI: 0.985-8.785, P = 0.053) independently determined an increased all-cause mortality. New hard cardiac events occurred more frequently in presence of peripheral vascular disease (RR = 2.975, CI: 1.339-6.608, P = 0.007), viability (RR = 3.427, CI: 1.400-8.390, P = 0.007) and severe ischemia (RR = 3.245, CI: 1.503-7.005, P = 0.003). In diabetic patients with known or suspected CAD, presence of viability and severe ischemia during DSE are independently associated with higher occurrence of hard cardiac events.
ABCG2 is a member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which can pump a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds out of cells. Widely expressed in stem cells, ABCG2 is also found to confer the side population phenotype and is recognized as a universal marker of stem cells. Although the precise physiological role of ABCG2 in stem cells is still unclear, existing data strongly suggest that ABCG2 plays an important role in promoting stem cell proliferation and the maintenance of the stem cell phenotype. In addition, ABCG2 is also found to be expressed in a number of cancer cells and appears to be a marker of cancer stem cells. Moreover, ABCG2 expression in tumors may contribute to their formation and progression. Thus, ABCG2 has potential applications in stem cell and tumor therapy.
CFTR has been recognized to function as both an anion channel and a key regulator of Slc26 anion transporters in heterologous expression systems. Whether this regulatory relationship between CFTR and Slc26 transporters is seen in native intestine, and whether this effect is coupled to CFTR transport function or other features of this protein, has not been studied. The duodena of anesthetized CFTR-, NHE3-, Slc26a6-, and Scl26a3-deficient mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were perfused, and duodenal bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) secretion (DBS) and fluid absorptive or secretory rates were measured. The selective NHE3 inhibitor S1611 or genetic ablation of NHE3 significantly reduced fluid absorptive rates and increased DBS. Slc26a6 (PAT1) or Slc26a3 (DRA) ablation reduced the S1611-induced DBS increase and reduced fluid absorptive rates, suggesting that the effect of S1611 or NHE3 ablation on HCO(3)(-) secretion may be an unmasking of Slc26a6- and Slc26a3-mediated Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange activity. In the absence of CFTR expression or after application of the CFTR(inh)-172, fluid absorptive rates were similar to those of WT, but S1611 induced virtually no increase in DBS, demonstrating that CFTR transport activity, and not just its presence, is required for Slc26-mediated duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion. A functionally active CFTR is an absolute requirement for Slc26-mediated duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion, but not for Slc26-mediated fluid absorption, in which these transporters operate in conjunction with the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE3. This suggests that Slc26a6 and Slc26a3 need proton recycling via NHE3 to operate in the Cl(-) absorptive mode and Cl(-) exit via CFTR to operate in the HCO(3)(-) secretory mode.
CYP2C9 is one of the most abundant CYP enzymes in the human liver ( approximately 20% of hepatic total CYP content). CYP2C9 metabolizes approximately 20% clinical drugs (>120 drugs), including a number of drugs with narrow therapeutic ranges. Some natural compounds are also metabolized, probably leading to the formation of toxic metabolites. CYP2C9 also plays a role in the metabolism of several endogenous compounds such as steroids, melatonin, retinoids and arachidonic acid. Typical substrates of CYP2C9 such as celecoxib, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, and diclofenac are relatively small, lipophilic and contain acidic groupings with pK(a) values in the range 3.8-8.1 which will be ionized at physiological pH. The carboxylate groups of tienilic acid and diclofenac have been shown to be responsible for substrate preference and orientation in the active site of CYP2C9. Therefore, a typical CYP2C9 substrate should contain an anionic site and a hydrophobic site. However, neutral or positively charged compounds may also be substrates of CYP2C9. CYP2C9 is subject to inhibition by a number of drugs and other compounds and this may provide an explanation for some clinical drug-drug interactions. With regard to prodrugs that need CYP2C9 for activation, inhibition of CYP2C9 may cause a decrease in the amount of the active metabolite, leading to therapeutic failure. Pharmacophore models have revealed that hydrogen bonding, ion-pair interactions, and probably hydrophobic interactions play a major role in determining the substrate specificity and inhibitor selectivity of CYP2C9. A number of structure-activity relationship studies have identified the structural determinants of compounds for their binding affinity to CYP2C9 and inhibitory potency for CYP2C9. Given the critical role of CYP2C9 in drug metabolism and the presence of polymorphisms, it is important to identify drug candidates as potential substrates and/or inhibitors of CYP2C9 in drug development and drugs with minimal interactions with this enzyme should be chosen for further development. Further studies are warranted to explore the molecular determinants for ligand-CYP2C9 binding and the structure-activity relationships.
SLC18A2 encodes the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 protein that regulates neurotransmission and reduces cytosolic toxicity of monoamines. Deletion of this gene causes lethality in mice, and DNA sequence variation in this gene is associated with alcoholism and Parkinson's disease, among other disorders. The Caucasian SLC18A2 promoter has at least 20 haplotypes (A-T), with A representing two-thirds of 1460 chromosomes. It is not known why A is selected in the human lineage. To understand the selection, here we took a functional approach by investigating the regulations of 4 representative haplotypes (A, C, G, and T) by 17 agents. We show that 76.5% of the agents were able to regulate A but only 11.8-23.5% of them regulated the 3 other infrequent ones, observing a positive correlation between haplotype frequency and regulatability. Pathway and molecular analyses revealed five signaling hubs that regulate the four haplotypes differentially, probably through targeting the polymorphic core promoter region. These findings suggest that greater diversity of transcriptional regulations is the driving force for the haplotype selection in SLC18A2.
SLC11A1 (solute carrier family 11 member A1) protein is located on the phagolysosome membrane of macrophages and participates in bacterial killing. Here we have extended our previous work on the investigation of the potential association of polymorphisms of the 3'untranslated region (UTR) of SLC11A1 gene with test-positivity of goats to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Blood, serum and faeces were collected from 223 adult goats, from nine goat farms from Greece with a long-term record of paratuberculosis but no vaccination or tuberculin testing. The samples were subjected to sequence and structure analysis of the SLC11A1 gene and were evaluated by ELISA, culture and real time polymerase chain reaction. The 3'UTR region of the targeted gene revealed 2 microsatellites consisting of a variable number of guanine-thymine repeats named regions A and B. Statistically significant association was recorded between genotypes of region B and ELISA results, whereas the presence of B(7) allele was found to contribute to ELISA negativity. The comparison of the SLC11A1 mRNA level pre- and post-exposure to MAP shows elevated gene expression especially at the 3-h time point, in all macrophages tested regardless of their genotype. Unfortunately the latter could not be linked at a statistically significant level with any of the targeted genetic polymorphisms separately. In conclusion it can be stated that the evidence reported here provide the first indications on the association of B genotypes of the SLC11A1 gene and the detection of MAP-specific antibody by ELISA in goats.
CYP27B1 catalyzes the 1alpha-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the hormonally active form of vitamin D3. To further characterize mouse CYP27B1, it was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and its activity measured on substrates incorporated into phospholipid vesicles, which served as a model of the inner mitochondrial membrane. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 in vesicles underwent 1alpha-hydroxylation with similar kinetics, the catalytic rate constants (k(cat)) were 41 and 48mol/min/mol P450, respectively, while K(m) values were 5.9 and 4.6mmol/mol phospholipid, respectively. CYP27B1 showed inhibition when substrate concentrations in the membrane were greater than 4 times K(m), more pronounced with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 than 25-hydroxyvitamin D2. Higher catalytic efficiency was seen in vesicles prepared from dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine and cardiolipin than for dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles. CYP27B1 also catalyzed 1alpha-hydroxylation of vesicle-associated 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 20-hydroxyvitamin D3, and 25-hydroxylation of 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D2, but with much lower efficiency than for 25(OH)D3. This study shows that CYP27B1 can hydroxylate 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 associated with phospholipid membranes with the highest activity yet reported for the enzyme. The expressed enzyme has low activity at higher concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in membranes, revealing that substrate inhibition may contribute to the regulation of the activity of this enzyme.
"CA3 pyramidal neurons and hilar mossy neurons possess large and branched dendritic spines, named thorny excrescences. Studies on experimental animals have shown great morphologic adaptation of the excrescences and the whole dendritic tree of CA3 pyramidal neurons in changes of environmental conditions. However, the available data about the excrescences in human brain is short and insufficient about their properties in Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, these dendritic structures were studied and compared in CA3 area of hippocampus in patients suffered from Alzheimer's disease, age matched controls and young individuals. Golgi impregnated material under light microscopy was used for the description of the structural characteristics of the excrescences. Morphometric estimation of their density on the apical and basilar dendritic tree and their average length revealed reduced density and significantly increased size in Alzheimer's disease patients. The mean density of the excrescences on the apical dendritic tree of the patients compared to age matched controls is reduced 32.8% (p<0.001), while the mean number of long excrescences (longer than 5microm) is increased 32.6% (p<0.05). On the basilar dendritic tree, the reduction in density is 26.3% (p<0.05) and the increase in the number of long excrescences is 23.3% (p>0.05). These enlarged thorny excrescences can be even longer than 10microm, appearing as ""giant spines"". The increased size of the excrescences is considered as a remodeling procedure (compensative mechanism) of the CA3 pyramidal neurons for the balancing of the reduction in the spinal density."
ABCG5 and ABCG8 are half-size ABC transporters that function as heterodimers (ABCG5/G8) to reduce sterol absorption in the intestines and increase sterol excretion from the liver. Previous studies demonstrated that bile acids increased ABCG5/G8 specific cholesterol efflux in cell models. In this study we tested the effects of bile acids on ATP hydrolysis in Pichia pastoris purified ABCG5/G8 and found that they stimulated hydrolysis approximately 20-fold in wild-type ABCG5/G8 but not in a hydrolysis-deficient mutant. Nonconjugated cholate supported the highest ATPase activity in ABCG5/G8 (256 +/- 9 nmol min(-1) mg(-1)). ATP hydrolysis was also stimulated by other conjugated bile acids and a mixture of bile acids resembling human bile with activities ranging from 129 +/- 4 to 147 +/- 14 nmol min(-1) mg(-1). The kinetic parameters, inhibitor profiles, and lipid requirements of bile acid stimulated ATP hydrolysis were characterized. Cholate-stimulated ATP hydrolysis was maximal at concentrations of >or=10 mM MgATP and had a relatively high K(M) (MgATP) of approximately 1 mM. Orthovanadate, BeFx, and AlFx effectively inhibited ABCG5/G8 at concentrations of 1 mM. Various lipid mixtures supported bile acid-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, which increased when cholesterol was present. The data demonstrate that bile acids together with lipids and cholesterol increase ATP hydrolysis in purified ABCG5/G8. Bile acids may promote an active conformation of purified ABCG5/G8 either by global stabilization of the transporter or by binding to a specific site on ABCG5/G8.
PON3 is a member of the paraoxonase gene family that includes PON1 and PON2. For example, PON3 and PON1 share approximately 60% identity at the amino acid level. Recent studies have demonstrated that PON3 is present in human and rabbit HDL but not in mouse HDL. Mouse PON3 appears to be cell-associated and is expressed in a wide range of tissues such as liver, adipose, macrophage, and the artery wall. In vitro studies have shown that PON3 can prevent LDL oxidation and destroy bacterial quorum-sensing molecules. Previous studies also showed that human PON3 transgenic mice were protected from obesity and atherosclerosis in both the C57BL/6 J wild-type and LDLR knockout genetic background. Administration of adenovirus expressing the human PON3 gene into apoE -/- mice also decreased atherosclerotic lesion formation. In order to further understand the functions of PON3 in physiology and disease, we performed in situ hybridization analysis to examine Pon3 gene expression patterns in newborn and adult mice, in various tissues, including atherosclerotic lesions of apoE -/- mice. Our results show relatively high levels of Pon3 mRNA labeling in the adrenal gland, submaxillary gland, lung, liver, adipose, pancreas, large intestine, and other tissues of newborn mice. In the adult mouse, Pon3 mRNA levels were much lower in the corresponding tissues as mentioned above for the newborn mouse. Sections of the aortic root from the hearts of both wild-type and apoE -/- mice displayed moderate levels of Pon3 mRNA labeling. Pon3 mRNA was also detected in the atherosclerotic lesion areas at the aortic root of apoE -/- hearts. Our data revealed that mouse Pon3 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, and that its expression is temporally controlled.
ABO blood group compatibility has been regarded as an essential prerequisite for successful adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Novel strategies for overcoming the ABO blood group barrier, however, have markedly improved the results of ABO-incompatible (ABOi) LDLT. We describe our strategies for dual graft LDLT to cope with ABO-incompatibility and small-for-size graft syndrome in 3 patients who underwent dual graft LDLT with ABOi and ABO-compatible (ABOc) grafts. One patient received a modified right lobe graft from an ABOi living donor and a left lateral section graft from an ABOc deceased donor, whereas the other 2 patients received 2 left lobe or left lateral section grafts from ABOi and ABOc living donors. To overcome the ABO-blood barrier, each patient was treated with preoperative anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab 375 mg/m(2)), perioperative plasma exchange, and hepatic arterial infusion. All 3 patients were males, of mean age 47.7 years (range, 40 approximately 52 years) and mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score 12.3 (range, 9 approximately 15). The mean graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 0.99%. All patients remain alive after a mean follow-up period of 9.5 months (range, 8.0 approximately 10.7 months). All 6 grafts have functioned normally. There were no episodes of antibody-mediated rejection or biliary complication. Dual LDLT with ABOi and ABOc grafts can be a feasible solution for simultaneously overcoming both the ABO blood group barrier and small-for-size graft syndrome.
ABO incompatibility is the most common cause of donor rejection during the initial screening of adult patients with end-stage liver disease for living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). A paired donor exchange program was initiated to cope with this problem without ABO-incompatible LDLT. We present our results from the first 6 years of this exchange adult LDLT program. Between July 2003 and June 2009, 1351 adult LDLT procedures, including 16 donor exchanges and 7 ABO-incompatible LDLT procedures, were performed at our institution. Initial donor-recipient ABO incompatibilities included 6 A to B incompatibilities, 6 B to A incompatibilities, 1 A to O incompatibility, 1 A+O (dual graft) to B incompatibility, 1 O to AB incompatibility, and 1 O to A incompatibility. Fourteen matches (87.5%) were ABO-incompatible, but 2 (12.5%) were initially ABO-compatible. All ABO-incompatible donors were directly related to their recipients, but 2 compatible donors were each undirected and unrelated directed. After donor reassignment through paired exchange (n = 7) or domino pairing (n = 1), the donor-recipient ABO status changed to A to A in 6, B to B in 6, O to O in 1, A to AB in 1, A+O to A in 1, and O to B in 1, and this made all matches ABO-identical (n = 13) or ABO-compatible (n = 3). Two pairs of LDLT operations were performed simultaneously on an elective basis in 12 and on an emergency basis in 4. All donors recovered uneventfully. Fifteen of the 16 recipients survived, but 1 died after 54 days. In conclusion, an exchange donor program for adult LDLT appears to be a feasible modality for overcoming donor-recipient ABO incompatibility.
CYP4F2 is a member of the cytochrome P450 enzymes and is responsible for metabolizing arachidonic acid to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE); 20-HETE plays a role in the regulation of vascular tone in the cerebral, coronary, and renal circulation. The present study aimed to evaluate whether or not the CYP4F2 gene polymorphism V433M (rs2108622) is involved in ischemic stroke in the Northern Chinese Han population.
CYP24A1 expression is up-regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) via a vitamin D receptor (VDR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer that binds to two vitamin D response elements (VDREs) located near the proximal promoter. Interestingly, although 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induced VDR/RXR binding to the VDRE-containing proximal promoter, the VDR/RXR heterodimer also localized to a cluster of at least four potential enhancers located in intergenic regions 50-69 kb downstream of the human CYP24A1 gene and 35-45 kb downstream of the mouse Cyp24a1 gene as revealed by ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq analyses. To address whether this downstream region and potential VDREs located within mediated CYP24A1 induction, we constructed recombinant wild-type and mutant bacterial artificial chromosome clones that spanned mouse and human loci and contained luciferase reporters inserted into their 3'-untranslated regions. The activity of these clones in stably transfected cells revealed that both the proximal and the putative downstream elements contributed to CYP24A1 up-regulation by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Further analysis using transfected enhancer fragments led to the identification of contributing regulatory elements in several of these downstream regions. Additional studies of coregulator recruitment using ChIP-chip analysis revealed both similarities and differences between the region located proximal to and those located downstream of the promoter. Recruitment of these coregulators was likely responsible for the increase in RNA polymerase II and histone H4 acetylation, which was also observed in response to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) at the enhancer sites across the locus. We conclude that a more complex mechanism is responsible for the striking CYP24A1 up-regulation induced by the vitamin D hormone in target cells.
ACSL3 is a member of the long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) family that plays key roles in fatty acid metabolism in various tissues in an isozyme-specific manner. Our previous studies showed that ACSL3 was transcriptionally up-regulated by the cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) in HepG2 cells, accompanied by reduced cellular triglyceride content and enhanced beta-oxidation. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the OSM-induced activation of ACSL3 gene transcription in HepG2 cells. We showed that OSM treatment resulted in a coordinated elevation of mRNA levels of ACSL3 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta). The effect of OSM on ACSL3 mRNA expression was inhibited by cellular depletion of PPARdelta. By utilizing a PPARdelta agonist, L165041, we demonstrated that activation of PPARdelta led to increases in ACSL3 promoter activity, mRNA level, and protein level in HepG2 cells. Analysis of the ACSL3 promoter sequence identified two imperfect PPAR-responsive elements (PPRE) located in the ACSL3 promoter region -944 to -915, relative to the transcription start site. The up-regulation of ACSL3 promoter activity by PPARdelta was abolished by deletion of this PPRE-containing region or mutation to disrupt the binding sites. Direct interactions of PPARdelta with ACSL3-PPRE sequences were demonstrated by gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Finally, we provided in vivo evidence showing that activation of PPARdelta by L165041 in hamsters increased ACSL3 mRNA and protein levels in the liver. These new findings define ACSL3 as a novel molecular target of PPARdelta in HepG2 cells and provide a regulatory mechanism for ACSL3 transcription in liver tissue.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene known to play an important role in the regulation of cell size. In this study we compared PTEN expression in the spinal cord of young (5 months old) vs. aged (32 months old) female rats and correlated them with alterations in neuron size and morphology in the same animals. Total and phosphorylated PTEN (pPTEN) as well as its downstream target phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) were assessed by Western blotting. Spinal cord neurons were morphometrically characterized. Total PTEN, pPTEN and total Akt expression were significantly higher in young rats than in aged animals. Expression of pAkt was stronger in aged animals. A significant increase in neuronal size was observed in large motoneurons of aged as compared with young rats. Our data show that in the spinal cord of rats, neuronal PTEN expression diminishes with advanced age while neuronal size increases. These results suggest that in the spinal cord, an age-related reduction in PTEN and increase of pAkt expression may be involved in the progressive enlargement of neurons.
PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS) is often recognized by the presence of macrocephaly and associated mucocutaneous features, and is notable for a profound predisposition to breast and thyroid cancers. Head circumference (HC) is rarely measured when evaluating women at high risk for breast cancer, but may offer insight into characterizing cancer risk. Patients enrolled in the University of Michigan Cancer Genetics registry for breast cancer evaluation were analyzed for personal and family history of cancer and features of PHTS. This group of women was compared to all women who had undergone PTEN testing and whether or not they met clinical criteria for PHTS. Among the 164 women referred for breast cancer risk evaluation, a statistically significant difference in mean HC was found between women who did (57.3 cm) and did not (55.4 cm) meet clinical criteria for PHTS with both values below the established threshold for macrocephaly (58 cm). The sensitivity and specificity of macrocephaly for the presence of a PTEN mutation were 100 and 53%, respectively, among the 28 women tested. The positive predictive value was 14%. PTEN mutation positive and PTEN mutation negative women were not well differentiated by PHTS clinical criteria (P = 0.2348). The high sensitivity of HC suggests that this simple measure can improve the detection of unrecognized patients with PHTS. Measuring HC is a useful clinical feature, but is insufficient as a singular screening tool for PHTS. Even in a high risk population, the PPV of this test is low. Diagnosis of this important genetic syndrome still relies heavily on detailed history and full physical exam.
ACE and ACE2 produce angiotensin II (Ang II), a vasopressor that induces cardiovascular remodeling, and Ang 1-7, a vasodilator with an antiremodeling effect. While Ang 1-7 has antiarrhythmic properties, at higher concentration it may induce ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. ACE2, therefore, may play an essential role in blood pressure homeostasis, in the long-term complications of hypertension (cardiovascular remodeling), and in the induction of cardiac electric abnormalities. This study evaluated the levels of ACE2 and Ang 1-7 in Bartter's/Gitelman's patients (BS/GS) who have elevated Ang II and endogenous blockade of Ang II type 1 receptor signaling compared with healthy subjects (C) and essential hypertensives (EH). BS/ GS patients were also considered because of their predisposition to cardiac arrhythmias, which has yet to be completely clarified.
ABCC2 (MRP2) is an important export pump, expressed at tissue barriers. The genetic variants -24C>T, 1249G>A and 3972C>T are leading to inter-individual differences of bioavailability of various endogenous and exogenous compounds. Considering ABCC2 haplotypes, we investigated DNA-protein binding properties, mRNA secondary structure, mRNA stability, protein expression and transport activity in various cell lines and analyzed the bioavailability of talinolol in 24 healthy Caucasian volunteers; -24C>T had no clear influence on DNA-protein binding and the mRNA stability did not differ significantly. In transfected HEK293T/17 cells, haplotypes H9 (CGT), H10 (TGC) and H12 (TGT) had significantly lower protein expression, whereas H2 (CAC) exhibited significantly increased protein expression compared to the wild type (H1, CGC): 32.7 ± 8.8, 73.1 ± 6.3; 44.0 ± 15.5 and 115.2 ± 8.2%, respectively. This corresponded with efflux rates of the fluorescent dye glutathione-methylfluorescein in vitro and by trend with talinolol bioavailability in vivo. In conclusion our results show a haplotype-dependent influence on transport capacity of ABCC2, which seems to be mainly based on posttranscriptional modification of protein expression rather than transport rates.
CYP2C9 3 (1075A/C) is an inherited single nuclear polymorphism (SNP) of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9, which affects the activity of the enzyme. In vitro studies with several drugs have indicated that the CYP2C9 3 variant has an impaired capacity for drug metabolism. Therefore an efficient detection assay for this mutation may be important for clinical dose adjustment.
CD36 facilitates oxidized low density lipoprotein uptake and is implicated in development of atherosclerotic lesions. CD36 also binds unmodified high and very low density lipoproteins (HDL, VLDL) but its role in the metabolism of these particles is unclear. Several polymorphisms in the CD36 gene were recently shown to associate with serum HDL cholesterol. To gain insight into potential mechanisms for these associations we examined HDL metabolism in CD36 null (CD36(-/-)) mice. Feeding CD36(-/-) mice a high cholesterol diet significantly increased serum HDL, cholesterol and phospholipids, as compared to wild type mice. HDL apolipoproteins apoA-I and apoA-IV were increased and shifted to higher density HDL fractions suggesting altered particle maturation. Clearance of dual-labeled HDL was unchanged in CD36(-/-) mice and cholesterol uptake from HDL or LDL by isolated CD36(-/-) hepatocytes was unaltered. However, CD36(-/-) hepatocytes had higher cholesterol and phospholipid efflux rates. In addition, expression and secretion of apoA-I and apoA-IV were increased reflecting enhanced PXR. Similar to hepatocytes, cholesterol and phospholipid efflux were enhanced in CD36(-/-) macrophages without changes in protein levels of ABCA1, ABCG1 or SR-B1. However, biotinylation assays showed increased surface ABCA1 localization in CD36(-/-) cells. In conclusion, CD36 influences reverse cholesterol transport and hepatic ApoA-I production. Both pathways are enhanced in CD36 deficiency, increasing HDL concentrations, which suggests the potential benefit of CD36 inhibition.
CYP2D6 is an important enzyme that is involved in first pass metabolism and is responsible for metabolizing ~25% of currently marketed drugs. A homology model of CYP2D6 was built using X-ray structures of ligand-bound CYP2C5 complexes as templates. This homology model was used in docking studies to rationalize and predict the site of metabolism of known CYP2D6 substrates. While the homology model was generally found to be in good agreement with the recently solved apo (ligand-free) X-ray structure of CYP2D6, significant differences between the structures were observed in the B' and F-G helical region. These structural differences are similar to those observed between ligand-free and ligand-bound structures of other CYPs and suggest that these conformational changes result from induced-fit adaptations upon ligand binding. By docking to the homology model using Glide, it was possible to identify the correct site of metabolism for a set of 16 CYP2D6 substrates 85% of the time when the 5 top scoring poses were examined. On the other hand, docking to the apo CYP2D6 X-ray structure led to a loss in accuracy in predicting the sites of metabolism for many of the CYP2D6 substrates considered in this study. These results demonstrate the importance of describing substrate-induced conformational changes that occur upon binding. The best results were obtained using Glide SP with van der Waals scaling set to 0.8 for both the receptor and ligand atoms. A discussion of putative binding modes that explain the distribution of metabolic sites for substrates, as well as a relationship between the number of metabolic sites and substrate size, are also presented. In addition, analysis of these binding modes enabled us to rationalize the typical hydroxylation and O-demethylation reactions catalyzed by CYP2D6 as well as the less common N-dealkylation.
CP violation in the quark sector has been well established over the last decade, but has not been observed in the lepton sector. We search for CP violating decay processes in positronium, using the angular correlation of (S x k{1})(S x k{1}x k{2}), where S is the positronium spin and k{1}, k{2} are the directions of the positronium decay photons. To a sensitivity of 2.2x10{-3}, no CP violation has been found, which is at the level of the CP violation amplitude in the K meson. A 90% confidence interval of the CP violation parameter (C{CP}) was determined to be -0.0023<C{CP}<0.0049. This result is a factor 7 more strict than that of the previous experiment.
RPE cells are a major player in various diseases of the retina and choroid. Proliferating RPE cells are thought to be an initiating factor in proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR); the aging RPE cells are important in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Early passages of cultured human retinal pigment epithelial cells were used as a model system to identify differentially expressed genes in proliferating retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells.
SDS has recognized benefits for protein sample preparation, including solubilization and imparting molecular weight separation (e.g., SDS-PAGE). Here, we compare two proteome workflows which incorporate SDS for protein separation, namely, SDS-PAGE coupled to LC/MS (GeLC MS), along with a solution separation platform, GELFrEE, for intact proteome prefractionation and identification. Despite the clear importance of SDS in these and other proteome analysis workflows, the affect of SDS on an LC/MS proteome experiment has not been quantified. We first examined the influence of SDS on both a bottom-up as well as a top-down (intact protein) MS workflow. Surprisingly, at levels up to 0.01% SDS in the injected sample, reliable MS characterization is obtained. We subsequently explored organic precipitation protocols (chloroform/methanol/water and acetone) as a means of lowering SDS, and present a simple modified acetone precipitation protocol which consistently enables MS proteome characterizations from samples initially containing 2% SDS. With this effective strategy for SDS reduction, the GELFrEE MS workflow for bottom-up proteome analysis was characterized relative to GeLC MS. Remarkable agreement in the number and type of identified proteins was obtained from these two separation platforms, validating the use of SDS in solution-phase proteome analysis.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is a tumor suppressor that antagonizes signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway. We have demonstrated that subtle decreases in PTEN abundance can have critical consequences for tumorigenesis. Here, we used a computational approach to identify miR-22, miR-25, and miR-302 as three PTEN-targeting microRNA (miRNA) families found within nine genomic loci. We showed that miR-22 and the miR-106b~25 cluster are aberrantly overexpressed in human prostate cancer, correlate with abundance of the miRNA processing enzyme DICER, and potentiate cellular transformation both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that the intronic miR-106b~25 cluster cooperates with its host gene MCM7 in cellular transformation both in vitro and in vivo, so that the concomitant overexpression of MCM7 and the miRNA cluster triggers prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in transgenic mice. Therefore, the MCM7 gene locus delivers two simultaneous oncogenic insults when amplified or overexpressed in human cancer. Thus, we have uncovered a proto-oncogenic miRNA-dependent network for PTEN regulation and defined the MCM7 locus as a critical factor in initiating prostate tumorigenesis.
CA1 inhibitory interneurons at the stratum lacunosum-moleculare and radiatum junction (LM/RAD-INs) display subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (MPOs) involving voltage-dependent Na(+) and A-type K(+) currents. LM/RAD-INs also express other voltage-gated K(+) currents, although their properties and role in MPOs remain unclear. Here, we characterized these voltage-gated K(+) currents and investigated their role in MPOs. Using outside-out patch recordings from LM/RAD-IN somata, we distinguished four voltage-gated K(+) currents based on their pharmacology and activation/inactivation properties: a fast delayed rectifier current (I(Kfast)), a slow delayed rectifier current (I(Kslow)), a rapidly inactivating A-type current (I(A)), and a slowly inactivating current (I(D)). Their relative contribution to the total K(+) current was I(A) > I(Kfast) > I(Kslow) = I(D). The presence of I(D) and the relative contributions of K(+) currents in LM/RAD-INs are different from those of other CA1 interneurons, suggesting the presence of differential complement of K(+) currents in subgroups of interneurons. We next determined whether these K(+) currents were sufficient for MPO generation using a single-compartment model of LM/RAD-INs. The model captured the subthreshold voltage dependence of MPOs. Moreover, all K(+) currents were active at subthreshold potentials but I(D), I(A), and the persistent sodium current (I(NaP)) were most active near threshold. Using impedance analysis, we found that I(A) and I(NaP) contribute to MPO generation by modulating peak spectral frequency during MPOs and governing the voltage range over which MPOs occur. Our findings uncover a differential expression of a complement of K(+) channels that underlies intrinsic rhythmic activity in inhibitory interneurons.
PIK3CA is one of the genes most frequently mutated in human cancers and it is a potential target for personalized therapy. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and type of PIK3CA mutations in gastric carcinoma and compare them with their clinical pathological correlates.
EBP (evidence-based practice) is becoming the standard paradigm in modern healthcare. Therefore different healthcare providers have the need for easily accessible evidence-based information. The Internet creates new opportunities to fill the gaps in education that are experienced by healthcare workers. Contributing to solutions and filling in the needs in the above-mentioned scope, the University of Brussels initiated a European project called MedSkills in 2004.
MTMR2 is a 3-phosphatase specific for the phosphoinositides PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P(2), which are mainly present on endosomes. Mutations in the MTMR2 gene in Schwann cells lead to a severe demyelinating peripheral neuropathy known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B1. MTMR2 expression is also detected in peripheral and central neurons, but neural functions of MTMR2 remain unclear. Here, we report that MTMR2 is localized to excitatory synapses of central neurons via direct interaction with PSD-95, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein abundant at excitatory synapses. Knockdown of MTMR2 in cultured neurons markedly reduces excitatory synapse density and function. This effect is rescued by wild-type MTMR2 but not by a mutant MTMR2 lacking PSD-95 binding or 3-phosphatase activity. MTMR2 knockdown leads to a decrease in the intensity of EEA1-positive early endosomes in dendrites but increases the intensity in the cell body region. Moreover, MTMR2 suppression promotes endocytosis, but not recycling, of the GluR2 subunit of AMPA receptors, which is an endosomal cargo. In addition, colocalization of internalized GluR2 with Lamp1-positive late endosomes/lysosomes is enhanced in the cell body area but not in dendrites. These results suggest that PSD-95-interacting MTMR2 contributes to the maintenance of excitatory synapses by inhibiting excessive endosome formation and destructive endosomal traffic to lysosomes.
PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) is the leading cause of fatal right ventricular failure. However, rarely detectable, cTnT [cardiac TnT (troponin T)] is a significant prognostic marker. Therefore the aim of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of a novel high-sensitive cTnT (hsTnT) assay as a parameter for functional and prognostic evaluation of PAH patients. In 55 PAH patients (idiopathic, n=20; chronic thromboembolic, n=30; and interstitial lung disease, n=5) with a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 45+/-18 mmHg, cTnT was measured by a fourth-generation conventional assay and a novel hsTnT assay with a lower detection limit at 2 pg/ml [total imprecision <10% at the 99th percentile value (13.4 pg/ml)]. In 90.9% of patients, cTnT was detectable using the hsTnT assay and in 30.9% using the fourth-generation assay. Concentrations >99th percentile were observed in 27.3% using hsTnT compared with 10.9% using the fourth-generation assay. A total of five out of six patients with cTnT values >30 pg/ml (fourth-generation assay) or >29.5 pg/ml (hsTnT assay) died during the 12-month follow-up. There was a correlation between hsTnT and 6-min walk distance (r=-0.92, P=0.0014), right ventricular systolic strain (r=0.95, P=0.0018) and strain rate (r=0.82, P=0.0021). In AUC (area under the curve) analysis, hsTnT predicted death at least as effectively as hFABP (heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein) or NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic protein). Moreover, hsTnT predicted a WHO (World Health Organization) functional class >II better than NT-proBNP or hFABP. In conclusion, in PAH patients, the novel biomarker hsTnT is associated with death and advanced WHO functional class, and is related to systolic right ventricular dysfunction and an impaired 6-min walk distance.
CYP2C8 has a major role in the metabolism of the anticancer agents 13-cis retinoic acid (13cisRA) and paclitaxel. There is evidence that polymorphisms in the CYP2C8 gene contribute to observed interindividual differences in paclitaxel metabolism. However, no studies have been performed to determine the relevance of CYP2C8 polymorphisms to 13cisRA metabolism. In the current study, the effect of two common nonsynonymous CYP2C8 polymorphisms, CYP2C8*3 (R139K and K399R) and *4 (I264M), on the metabolism of 13cisRA and paclitaxel was examined using an Escherichia coli expression system with coexpression of human cytochrome P450 reductase. No statistically significant differences in the level of 13cisRA 4-hydroxylase activity were associated with either CYP2C8 allelic variant compared with the wild-type CYP2C8.1 enzyme. Furthermore, no differences were observed for the CYP2C8.3 or CYP2C8.4 enzymes with respect to paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylase kinetics compared with wild-type CYP2C8.1. However, when the effects of the individual polymorphisms making up the CYP2C8*3 allele were considered, a significantly lower level of paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylase activity was associated with the K399R enzyme. A lower level of activity was also seen for the R139K enzyme, although this difference was not significant. No differences were observed with respect to 13cisRA 4-hydroxylase activity. We conclude that common CYP2C8 polymorphisms are unlikely to explain reported interindividual variation in 13cisRA or paclitaxel pharmacokinetics.
ABCG2 (BCRP) implicated as a member of the multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins in tumors, mediating efflux of a wide spectrum of anticancer drugs. In recent years, there has been an increasing tendency toward the exploring of the potential link between cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and development of multidrug resistance phenotype in patients with cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the COX-2 in modulating drug efflux by ABCG2 in a group of breast cancer cell lines.
ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers confer renal protection in proteinuric nephropaties, but recently worsening of renal outcomes has been reported in non-proteinuric patients treated with a combination of ramipril and telmisartan, compared to ramipril only. In view of these apparently contradictory data, the review wants to shed light on treatment modalities of patients with hypertension and chronic kidney disease.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) is a tumor suppressor gene implicated in a wide variety of human cancers, including glioblastoma. PTEN is a major negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Most human gliomas show high levels of activated Akt, whereas less than half of these tumors carry PTEN mutations or homozygous deletions. The unique ability of mesenchymal stem cells to track down tumor cells makes them as potential therapeutic agents. Based on this capability, new therapeutic approaches have been developed using mesenchymal stem cells to cure glioblastoma. However, molecular mechanisms of interactions between glioma cells and stem cells are still unknown.
ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are superior to dihydropyridine calcium-antagonists (DHP) with regard to reduction of albuminuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. It has been argued that with blood pressure outside the targets DHP may exaggerate albuminuria in hypertensive patients. We addressed the question in an observational study in patients with difficult-to-treat essential hypertension. We analyzed baseline data from patients (n=80) screened for a clinical trial in treatment-resistant hypertension. All patients were treated with an ACEI/ARB, a diuretic and at least a third drug in the highest tolerated dose. We compared 50 patients who were treated with DHPs with 30 who were not. Albuminuria was assessed as albumin excretion in 24-hour urine. Values are given as mean ± SD. All comparisons were made using unpaired t-test. There were no differences with regard to demographic parameters, blood pressure or duration of hypertension between both groups. Albumin excretion was 14.3 ± 16.9 mg/d in patients treated with DHPs and 8.5 ± 6.6 mg/d in patients treated without DHPs (p=0.036). Our data indicate that even in patients treated with ACEI/ARBs DHPs are associated with increased albuminuria. Since increases of albuminuria even in the low range are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, detection of albuminuria should influence the choice of antihypertensive drugs in hypertensive patients with albuminuria.
FDPS (farnesyl diphosphate synthase) catalyses the formation of farnesyl diphosphate, a key intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol and isoprenylated cellular metabolites. FDPS is also the molecular target of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, which are used as bone-antiresorptive drugs in various disorders. In the present study, we characterized the sterol-response element and NF-Y (nuclear factor Y)-binding site in the human FDPS promoter. Using a luciferase assay, electrophoretic mobility-shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated that these elements are responsible for the transcription of the FDPS gene, and that its transcriptional activation is mediated by SREBP-2 (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein 2) and NF-Y. We also investigated whether sterol-mediated FDPS expression is involved in the cell proliferation induced by zoledronic acid, an FDPS inhibitor. We show that the SREBP-2- and NF-Y-mediated regulation of FDPS gene transcription modulates cell proliferation. These results suggest that SREBP-2 and NF-Y are required to trigger cell proliferation through the induction of FDPS expression and that the pharmacological action of zoledronic acid is involved in this pathway.
ACAT1 is normally a resident enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We previously showed that treating macrophages with denatured LDL causes a large increase in ER-derived, ACAT1-positive vesicles. Here, we isolated ER membranes and ER-derived vesicles to examine their ACAT enzyme activity in vitro. The results showed that when macrophages are grown under normal conditions, ACAT1 is located in high density ER membrane; its enzymatic activity is relatively low. Loading macrophages with cholesterol did not increase the total cellular ACAT1 protein content significantly but caused more ACAT1 to appear in ER-derived vesicles. These vesicles exhibit lower density and are associated with markers of both ER and the trans-Golgi network. When normalized with equal ACAT1 protein mass, the enzymatic activities of ACAT1 in ER-derived vesicles were 3-fold higher than those present in ER membrane. Results using reconstituted ACAT enzyme assay showed that the increase in enzyme activity in ER-derived vesicles is not due to an increase in the cholesterol content associated with these vesicles. Overall, our results show that macrophages cope with cholesterol loading by using a novel mechanism: they produce more ER-derived vesicles with elevated ACAT1 enzyme activity without having to produce more ACAT1 protein.
CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 exhibit catalytic activity predominantly for the 2-hydroxylation of estradiol, whereas CYP1B1 exhibits catalytic activity predominantly for 4-hydroxylation of estradiol. To understand why CYP1B1 predominantly hydroxylates the 4-position of estradiol, we constructed three-dimensional structures of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 by homology modeling, using the crystal structure of CYP1A2, and studied the docking mode of estradiol with CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1. The results demonstrated that two particular amino acid residues for each CYP, namely Thr124 and Phe260 of CYP1A2, Ser122 and Phe258 of CYP1A1, and Ala133 and Asn265 of CYP1B1, play an important role in estradiol recognition.
AQP7 is considered to be the sole adipose glycerol channel, and its regulation is crucial for glycemia control.
CD38 is an ecto-enzyme that hydrolyzes NAD. Its expression is a prognostic marker for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We have characterized individual variation in CD38 expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 288 healthy subjects of three ethnicities. Expression varied widely, with significant differences among ethnic groups, and was correlated significantly with CD38 enzymatic activity and protein levels. The CD38 gene was then resequenced using DNA from the same cell lines, with the identification of 53 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one indel, 39 novel. One SNP, rs1130169, was significantly associated with CD38 mRNA expression and explained a portion of the difference in expression among ethnic groups. EMS assay showed nuclear protein binding at or near this SNP. We also determined that variation in CD38 expression in these cell lines was associated with variation in antineoplastic drug sensitivity. These results represent a step toward understanding mechanisms involved in CD38 expression.
CYP2D6 31 (4042G>A, R(440)H) is an allelic variant of the highly polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme that has been associated with reduced functional activity. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared AmpliChip CYP450 test detects the 4042G>A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) but an allele assignment could not be made in two Spanish and two Puerto Rican individuals heterozygous for 4042G>A, resulting in no-calls. We aimed to resolve the CYP2D6 31 no-calls, determine the allele haplotype, and corroborate that CYP2D6 31 is associated with a poor metabolizer phenotype.
NAMPT encodes an enzyme catalysing the rate-limiting step in NAD biosynthesis. The extracellular form of the enzyme is known as adipokine visfatin. We detected SNP AM999341:g.669T>C (referred to as 669T>C) in intron 9 and SNP FN392209:g.358A>G (referred to as 358A>G) in the promoter of the gene. RH mapping linked the gene to microsatellite SW944. Linkage analysis placed the gene on the current USDA – USMARC linkage map at position 92 cM on SSC9. Association analyses were performed in a wild boar × Meishan F2 family (W × M), with 45 traits recorded (growth and fattening, fat deposition, muscling, meat quality, stress resistance and other traits), and in a commercial Landrace × Chinese-European (LCE) synthetic population with records for 15 traits (growth, fat deposition, muscling, intramuscular fat, meat colour and backfat fatty acid content). In the W × M, SNP 669T>C was associated with muscling, fat deposition, growth and fattening, meat quality and other traits and in the LCE with muscling, meat quality and backfat fatty acid composition. In the W × M, SNP 358A>G was associated with muscling, fat deposition, growth and other traits. After correction for multiple testing, the NAMPT haplotypes were associated in the W × M with, in descending order, muscling (q = 0.0056), growth (q = 0.0056), fat deposition (q = 0.0109), fat-to-meat ratio (q = 0.0135), cooling losses (q = 0.0568) and longissimus pHU (q = 0.0695). The SNPs are hypothesized to be in linkage disequilibrium with a causative mutation affecting energy metabolism as a whole rather than fat metabolism alone.
PIK3CA mutations are reported to be present in approximately 25% of breast cancer (BC), particularly the estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and HER2-overexpressing (HER2+) subtypes, making them one of the most common genetic aberrations in BC. In experimental models, these mutations have been shown to activate AKT and induce oncogenic transformation, and hence these lesions have been hypothesized to render tumors highly sensitive to therapeutic PI3K/mTOR inhibition. By analyzing gene expression and protein data from nearly 1,800 human BCs, we report that a PIK3CA mutation-associated gene signature (PIK3CA-GS) derived from exon 20 (kinase domain) mutations was able to predict PIK3CA mutation status in two independent datasets, strongly suggesting a characteristic set of gene expression-induced changes. However, in ER+/HER2- BC despite pathway activation, PIK3CA mutations were associated with a phenotype of relatively low mTORC1 signaling and a good prognosis with tamoxifen monotherapy. The relationship between clinical outcome and the PIK3CA-GS was also assessed. Although the PIK3CA-GS was not associated with prognosis in ER- and HER2+ BC, it could identify better clinical outcomes in ER+/HER2- disease. In ER+ BC cell lines, PIK3CA mutations were also associated with sensitivity to tamoxifen. These findings could have important implications for the treatment of PIK3CA-mutant BCs and the development of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.
ABO hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (ABO HDFN) may manifest itself in cases of mothers belonging to blood group O and newborns of groups A or B and more frequently in group A and less so in group B.
GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms have been proposed in relationship with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We investigated the association between these polymorphisms and COPD (as well as its subtypes emphysema and chronic bronchitis) in 234 COPD patients and 182 healthy controls in the Tunisian population. Genotyping was performed using multiplex PCR. GSTM1-null genotype frequency was significantly higher in COPD patients than in controls (P = 0.02); however, multivariate analysis of cofounding variables showed no independent association with this genotype (P = 0.073). In contrast, the association of the GSTM1-null genotype with emphysema was significant, even after adjustment for risk factors (P = 0.011). There were no significant differences in GSTT1 genotypes between patients and controls. The GSTM1 null allele is likely not an independent risk factor for COPD but is related to emphysema, whereas the GSTT1 gene is not associated with the disease.
G6PC3 deficiency, characterized by neutropenia and neutrophil dysfunction, is caused by deficiencies in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase-β (G6Pase-β or G6PC3) that converts glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) into glucose, the primary energy source of neutrophils. Enhanced neutrophil ER stress and apoptosis underlie neutropenia in G6PC3 deficiency, but the exact functional role of G6Pase-β in neutrophils remains unknown. We hypothesized that the ER recycles G6Pase-β-generated glucose to the cytoplasm, thus regulating the amount of available cytoplasmic glucose/G6P in neutrophils. Accordingly, a G6Pase-β deficiency would impair glycolysis and hexose monophosphate shunt activities leading to reductions in lactate production, adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) production, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity. Using annexin V-depleted neutrophils, we show that glucose transporter-1 translocation is impaired in neutrophils from G6pc3(-/-) mice and G6PC3-deficient patients along with impaired glucose uptake in G6pc3(-/-) neutrophils. Moreover, levels of G6P, lactate, and ATP are markedly lower in murine and human G6PC3-deficient neutrophils, compared with their respective controls. In parallel, the expression of NADPH oxidase subunits and membrane translocation of p47(phox) are down-regulated in murine and human G6PC3-deficient neutrophils. The results establish that in nonapoptotic neutrophils, G6Pase-β is essential for normal energy homeostasis. A G6Pase-β deficiency prevents recycling of ER glucose to the cytoplasm, leading to neutrophil dysfunction.
PFKFB3 is the gene that codes for the inducible isoform of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (iPFK2), a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis. As one of the targets of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), PFKFB3/iPFK2 is up-regulated by thiazolidinediones. In the present study, using PFKFB3/iPFK2-disrupted mice, the role of PFKFB3/iPFK2 in the anti-diabetic effect of PPARgamma activation was determined. In wild-type littermate mice, PPARgamma activation (i.e. treatment with rosiglitazone) restored euglycemia and reversed high fat diet-induced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. In contrast, PPARgamma activation did not reduce high fat diet-induced hyperglycemia and failed to reverse insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in PFKFB3(+/-) mice. The lack of anti-diabetic effect in PFKFB3(+/-) mice was associated with the inability of PPARgamma activation to suppress adipose tissue lipolysis and proinflammatory cytokine production, stimulate visceral fat accumulation, enhance adipose tissue insulin signaling, and appropriately regulate adipokine expression. Similarly, in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, knockdown of PFKFB3/iPFK2 lessened the effect of PPARgamma activation on stimulating lipid accumulation. Furthermore, PPARgamma activation did not suppress inflammatory signaling in PFKFB3/iPFK2-knockdown adipocytes as it did in control adipocytes. Upon inhibition of excessive fatty acid oxidation in PFKFB3/iPFK2-knockdown adipocytes, PPARgamma activation was able to significantly reverse inflammatory signaling and proinflammatory cytokine expression and restore insulin signaling. Together, these data demonstrate that PFKFB3/iPFK2 is critically involved in the anti-diabetic effect of PPARgamma activation.
NPR1 (for Nonexpressor of PR genes; also known as NIM1) is a positive regulator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in Arabidopsis, which controls the induction of Pathogenesis-Related (PR) genes by salicylic acid (SA). NPR1 interacts with members of two protein families, TGA transcription factors and NIMIN (for NIM1-interacting) proteins. In Arabidopsis, NIMIN1, NIMIN2 and NIMIN3 constitute a small gene family of structurally related, yet distinct members. To unravel the biological significance of NIMIN interaction with NPR1, we searched a tobacco yeast two-hybrid cDNA library for NPR1- and NIMIN2-binding proteins. One NPR1 cDNA clone and three clones encoding NIMIN proteins were isolated. Although clearly similar to At NPR1, Nt NPR1 does not interact with At NIMIN3. Furthermore, all Nt NIMIN proteins identified are structurally related to At NIMIN2, thus forming a small NIMIN2 subfamily in tobacco. cDNA clones encoding At NIMIN1 or At NIMIN3 homologues were not identified. The function of NIMIN2 proteins was studied by expression of Nt NIMIN2a chimeric genes in tobacco. While constitutive NIMIN2a over-expression delayed PR-1 protein induction, suppression of NIMIN2 transcripts enhanced the accumulation of PR-1 proteins. In both cases, the effects of altered NIMIN2 transcript levels became evident foremost early in SAR. Notably, Nt NIMIN2 gene expression is elevated prior to the induction of the PR-1a gene. Together, the data suggest that, in tobacco, NIMIN2 proteins control PR-1 gene expression, and that NIMIN2-mediated control is exerted through transient PR-1 repression before SAR has fully developed. Furthermore, although sharing conserved domains and functions, tobacco and Arabidopsis NPR1 and NIMIN proteins are clearly distinct.
DUOX1 and DUOX2 are members of the NADPH oxidase family that are specifically regulated to produce hydrogen peroxide in epithelia of the thyroid, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract. The determinants of DUOX1 or DUOX2 expression in various tissues have not been established. Using respiratory tract epithelial cells as a model, we investigated changes in DUOX mRNA and protein expression during the first 10 days of differentiation. By comparing a respiratory tract cell line, HBE1, with primary tracheobronchial epithelial (TBE) cells, we determined that DUOX2 was significantly expressed only in cell conditions that included all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). In HBE1 cells, DUOX2 mRNA increased 6-fold after ATRA treatment. Similarly, ATRA induced a 19-fold increase in DUOX2 mRNA expression in primary TBE cells with parallel increases in DUOX protein and DUOX-mediated H(2)O(2) production as well. In addition, DUOX2 induction by rhinovirus required the presence of ATRA. ATRA had no effect on DUOX1 expression for all the conditions studied. Our data indicate that for respiratory epithelial cells, ATRA is important in the regulation of DUOX2 expression, function, and rhinovirus-mediated DUOX2 inducibility.
IVD manufacturers are heavily reliant on novel IVD assays to fuel their growth and drive innovation within the industry. They represent a key part of the IVD industry's value proposition to customers and the healthcare industry in general, driving product differentiation, helping to create demand for new systems and generating incremental revenue. However, the discovery of novel biomarkers and their qualification for a specific clinical purpose is a high risk undertaking and the large, risky investments associated with doing this on a large scale are incompatible with IVD manufacturer's business models. This article describes the sources of novel IVD assays, the processes for discovering and qualifying novel assays and the reliance of IVD manufacturers on collaborations and in-licensing to source new IVD assays for their platforms.
CS is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder, which is mainly characterized by neurologic and sensory impairment, cachectic dwarfism, and photosensitivity. We describe the neuroimaging features (MR imaging, ¹H-MR spectroscopy, and CT) in the various clinical subtypes of CS from a cohort of genetically and biochemically proved cases. Hypomyelination, calcifications, and brain atrophy were the main imaging features. Calcifications were typically found in the putamen and less often in the cortex and dentate nuclei. Severe progressive atrophy was seen in the supratentorial white matter, the cerebellum, the corpus callosum, and the brain stem. Patients with early-onset disease displayed more severe hypomyelination and prominent calcifications in the sulcal depth of the cerebral cortex, but atrophy was less severe in late-onset patients. On proton MR spectroscopy, lactate was detected and Cho and NAA values were decreased. These combined neuroradiologic findings can help in the differential diagnosis of CS, distinguishing it from other leukoencephalopathies and/or cerebral calcifications in childhood.
MPO (myeloperoxidase) catalyses the oxidation of chloride, bromide and thiocyanate by hydrogen peroxide to HOCl (hypochlorous acid), HOBr (hypobromous acid) and HOSCN (hypothiocyanous acid) respectively. Specificity constants indicate that SCN- is a major substrate for MPO. HOSCN is also a major oxidant generated by other peroxidases including salivary, gastric and eosinophil peroxidases. While HOCl and HOBr are powerful oxidizing agents, HOSCN is a less reactive, but more specific, oxidant which targets thiols and especially low pKa species. In the present study we show that HOSCN targets cysteine residues present in PTPs (protein tyrosine phosphatases) with this resulting in a loss of PTP activity for the isolated enzyme, in cell lysates and intact J774A.1 macrophage-like cells. Inhibition also occurs with MPO-generated HOCl and HOBr, but is more marked with MPO-generated HOSCN, particularly at longer incubation times. This inhibition is reversed by dithiothreitol, particularly at early time points, consistent with the reversible oxidation of the active site cysteine residue to give either a cysteine-SCN adduct or a sulfenic acid. Inhibition of PTP activity is associated with increased phosphorylation of p38a and ERK2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 2) as detected by Western blot analysis and phosphoprotein arrays, and results in altered MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signalling. These data indicate that the highly selective targeting of some protein thiols by HOSCN can result in perturbation of cellular phosphorylation and altered cell signalling. These changes occur with (patho)physiological concentrations of SCN- ions, and implicate HOSCN as an important mediator of inflammation-induced oxidative damage, particularly in smokers who have elevated plasma levels of SCN-.
PC plays an important role in early diagnosis of health disorders, particularly migraine, due to the financial impact of this disease for the society and its impact on patients' quality of life. The aim of the study was to validate the self-administered MS-Q questionnaire for detection of hidden migraine in the field of primary care (PC), and to explore its use in this setting.
LPIN1 is a gene with important effects on lipidic and metabolic homeostasis. Human subcutaneous LPIN1 expression levels in adipose tissue are related with a better metabolic profile, including insulin sensitivity markers. However, there are few data on the regulation of LPIN1 in visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Our aim was to perform a cross-sectional analysis of VAT compared with subcutaneous (SAT) LPIN1 expression in a well-characterized obese cohort, its relation with the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, and the in vitro response to lipogenic and lipolytic stimuli. A downregulation of total LPIN1 mRNA expression in subjects with obesity was found in VAT similarly to that in SAT. Despite similar total LPIN1 mRNA levels in SAT and VAT, a close relationship with clinical parameters and with many lipogenic and lipolytic genes was observed primarily in SAT depot. As shown in the in vitro analysis, the low-grade proinflammatory environment and the insulin resistance associated with obesity may contribute to downregulate LPIN1 in adipose tissue, leading to a worse metabolic profile.
CYP17A1 plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of androgens in the adrenals and the gonads. Although this enzyme catalyzes two different reactions on one single active site, its specific activities are regulated independently. Although the 17alpha-hydroxylase activity is rather constant and regulated by gene expression, the 17,20-lyase activity varies significantly with the amount of cofactors or by protein phosphorylation. cAMP increases CYP17A1 expression, P450c17 phosphorylation, and androgen production. However, the exact mechanism(s) and the specific regulators of CYP17A1 remain unknown. Therefore, we studied the regulation of adrenal androgen biosynthesis in human adrenal H295R cells focusing on CYP17A1. We analyzed androgen production and P450c17 activities in H295R cells grown under normal and serum-free conditions and/or after stimulation with 8-bromoadenosine-cAMP. H295R cells grown in starvation medium produced more androgens and had decreased HSD3B2 expression and activity but increased P450c17-17,20-lyase activity and serine phosphorylation. Although starvation increased serine phosphorylation of P450c17 specifically, cAMP stimulation enhanced threonine phosphorylation exclusively. Time-course experiments revealed that a short cAMP stimulation augmented threonine phosphorylation of P450c17 but did not increase 17,20-lyase activity. By contrast, long cAMP stimulation increased androgen production through increased P450c17 activities by enhancing CYP17A1 gene expression. We conclude that serum withdrawal shifts steroidogenesis of H295R cells towards androgen production, providing a suitable model for detailed studies of androgen regulation. In addition, our study shows that starvation and cAMP stimulation regulate P450c17 phosphorylation differentially and that an increase in P450c17 phosphorylation does not necessarily lead to enhanced enzyme activity and androgen production.
PTEN is an important control element of PI3K/AKT signaling involved in controlling the processes of embryonic development, cell migration and apoptosis. While its dysfunction is implicated in a large fraction of cancers, PTEN activity in the same pathway may also contribute to metabolic syndromes such as diabetes. In those cases, selective inhibitors of PTEN may be useful. A new class of chiral PTEN inhibitors based on the 3-deoxy-phosphatidylinositol derivatives was recently identified (Wang et al. [17]). However, lack of detailed understanding of protein-ligand interactions has hampered efforts to develop effective agonists or antagonists of PTEN. Here, we use computational modeling to characterize the interactions of the diverse 3-deoxyphosphatidylinositol inhibitors with the PTEN protein. We show that, while each of the compounds binds with the inositol headgroup inserting into the proposed active site of the PTEN phosphatase domain, hydrogen bonding restrictions lead to distinct binding geometries for ligand pairs of opposite chirality. We furthermore demonstrate that the binding modes differ primarily in the orientation of acyl tails of the ligands and that the activity of the compounds is primarily controlled by the effectiveness of tail-protein contacts. These findings are confirmed by binding affinity calculations which are in good agreement with experiment. Finally, we show that while more potent d-series ligands bind in a manner similar to that of the native substrate, an alternate hydrophobic pocket suitable for binding the opposite chirality l-series inhibitors exists, offering the possibility of designing highly selective PTEN-targeting compounds.
ABCG2 is a putative marker of progenitor cells, including the corneal epithelium. The authors investigated whether ABCG2 functions in the homeostasis of corneal epithelial cells using abcg2 knockout (KO) mice and corneal epithelial cell lines.
ABCA4 is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which has been implicated in the clearance of all-trans retinal derivatives from rod and cone photoreceptor cells following photoexcitation as part of the visual cycle. Mutations in ABCA4 are known to cause Stargardt macular degeneration and related disorders, associated with a severe loss in vision. Recently, a solid-phase binding assay has been developed to identify retinoids that likely serve as substrates for this transporter. In this procedure, monoclonal antibodies directed either against an epitope within ABCA4 (Rim 3F4 antibody) or against the 9 amino acid 1D4 epitope tag engineered onto the C-terminus of expressed ABCA4 (Rho 1D4 antibody) are covalently bound to a Sepharose matrix. This immunoaffinity matrix is then used to isolate ABCA4 from photoreceptor outer segments or transfected cells. All-trans retinal is added to immobilized ABCA4 in the presence of a phospholipid mixture containing phosphatidylethanolamine. The bound retinoid is then analyzed directly by spectrophotometry or identified by HPLC and/or mass spectrometry following extraction with organic solvents. Using this procedure, it has been shown that unprotonated N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine binds with high affinity to ABCA4 and is released by the addition of ATP. These procedures and related radiometric assays using titrated retinal have been used to study the binding of N-retinylidene-PE to wild-type and mutant ABCA4 in the absence and presence of nucleotides for structure-function studies.
STRA6 is a multitransmembrane domain protein that was recently identified as the cell-surface receptor for plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP), the vitamin A carrier protein in the blood. STRA6 binds to RBP with high affinity and mediates cellular uptake of vitamin A from RBP. It is not homologous to any known receptors, transporters, and channels, and it represents a new class of membrane transport protein. Consistent with the diverse physiological functions of vitamin A, STRA6 is widely expressed in diverse adult organs and throughout embryonic development. Mutations in human STRA6 that abolish its vitamin A uptake activity cause severe pathological phenotypes in many human organs including the eye, brain, lung, and heart. This chapter describes functional assays for STRA6 in live cells and on cellular membranes. These assays can be employed to study the mechanism of this new membrane transport mechanism and its roles in the physiology and pathology of many organs.
SLC17A1 protein (NPT1) is the first identified member of the SLC17 phosphate transporter family and mediates the transmembrane cotransport of Na(+)/P(i) in oocytes. Although this protein is believed to be a renal polyspecific anion exporter, its transport properties are not well characterized. Here, we show that proteoliposomes containing purified SLC17A1 transport various organic anions such as p-aminohippuric acid and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) in an inside positive membrane potential (Deltapsi)-dependent manner. We found that NPT1 also transported urate. The uptake characteristics were similar to that of SLC17 members in its Cl(-) dependence and inhibitor sensitivity. When arginine 138, an essential amino acid residue for members of the SLC17 family such as the vesicular glutamate transporter, was specifically mutated to alanine, the resulting mutant protein was inactive in Deltapsi-dependent anion transport. Heterologously expressed and purified human NPT1 carrying the single nucleotide polymorphism mutation that is associated with increased risk of gout in humans exhibited 32% lower urate transport activity compared with the wild type protein. These results strongly suggested that NPT1 is a Cl(-)-dependent polyspecific anion exporter involved in urate excretion under physiological conditions.
ACE inhibition has been shown to improve left ventricular (LV) and myocardial blood flow. Previous data regarding changes in capillary density and angiogenesis during ACE inhibition are controversial. The aim of the following study was to determine myocardial microcirculation and heart function in the rat after coronary stenosis using non invasive MR imaging techniques. MR spin labeling and cine techniques have been performed in female Wistar rats 2weeks after coronary artery stenosis. In one group, animals were treated with quinapril in a dose of 6mg/kg/day. Perfusion, relative blood volume (RBV), LV mass and function were determined non-invasively 2weeks after treatment. Finally, fibrosis and capillary density were analyzed histologically. Additionally, hemodynamic measurements were realized in a further group in order to calculate systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Quinapril resulted in a significant increase in perfusion at rest in the remote and the poststenotic myocardium with improved systolic function and a decrease in SVR compared to the non treated control group. Additionally, maximum perfusion and RBV were slightly elevated whereas capillary density was unchanged among the groups. MRI allows for non-invasive quantification of functional microcirculation and heart function. In addition to the well known effect of ACE inhibition on systolic function, treatment with the tissue specific ACE inhibitor quinapril revealed an important microvascular improvement, especially at arteriolar level. These findings may support the use of tissue ACE inhibitors to improve cardiac microcirculation after ischemia.
CFTR is a cAMP-activated chloride channel responsible for agonist stimulated chloride and fluid transport across epithelial surfaces.(1) Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to cystic fibrosis (CF) which affects the function of secretory organs like the intestine, the pancreas, the airways and the sweat glands. Most of the morbidity and mortality in CF has been linked to a decrease in airway function.(2) The ΔF508 mutation is the most common CF-related mutation in the Caucasian population and represents 90% of CF alleles. Homozygote carriers of this mutation present with a severe CF phenotype.(3) The ΔF508 mutation causes misfolding of the nascent CFTR polypeptide, which leads to inefficient export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and rapid degradation by the proteasome.
CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes could be used to predict warfarin requirement. The objective was to develop and validate a warfarin dosing algorithm using genetic, clinical and demographic data of Chinese patients from an anticoagulation clinic in Hong Kong. Blood samples were collected from 100 patients on stable maintenance dose of warfarin, recruited from an anticoagulation clinic, for genotyping CYP2C9 and VKORC1. Clinical and demographic data were obtained by face-to-face interview and medical chart review. Data of 80 patients (study cohort) were randomly selected for deriving a dosing algorithm. Comparison between predicted dose and actual stable doses was conducted in a validation cohort (n = 20). Sixty-nine (69%) of all 100 patients were homozygous for VKORC1 1173-TT, 25 (25%) were VKORC1 1173-CT heterozygotes and six (6%) were homozygous for VKORC1 1173-CC. 6 (6%) patients were CYP2C9 1*/3* and 94 (94%) were CYP2C9 1*/1*. CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype, age, weight and vitamin K intake were identified by stepwise regression modelling to produce the best model for estimating warfarin dose (R (2) = 68%, P < 0.001). In the validation cohort (n = 20), actual stable dose was significantly associated with predicted dose (R = 0.6, P = 0.005). Five of 11 (45.6%) and 5/9 (55.6%) patients whose mean warfarin requirements were ≤ 3 mg/day and >3 mg/day, respectively, were within <20% of actual doses. In conclusion, a genotype-guided dosing algorithm for warfarin therapy was developed for Chinese patients to explain 68% of dosage variation. The predicted doses differed from the actual doses by no more than 20% in 50% of patients.
GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) is a key enzyme of the glycolytic pathway and it is related to the occurrence of some diseases. The cDNA and the genomic sequence of GAPDH were cloned successfully from the Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) using the RT-PCR technology and Touchdown-PCR, respectively. Both sequences were analyzed preliminarily. The cDNA of GAPDH cloned from the Giant Panda is 1191 bp in size, contains an open reading frame of 1002 bp encoding 333 amino acids. The genomic sequence is 3941 bp in length and was found to possess 10 exons and 9 introns. Alignment analysis indicates that the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence are highly conserved in some mammalian species, including Homo sapiens, Mu musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Canis lupus familiaris and Bos taurus. The homologies for the nucleotide sequences of the Giant Panda GAPDH to that of these species are 90.67, 90.92, 90.62, 95.01 and 92.32% respectively, while the homologies for the amino acid sequences are 94.93, 95.5, 95.8, 98.8 and 97.0%. Primary structure analysis revealed that the molecular weight of the putative GAPDH protein is 35.7899 kDa with a theoretical pI of 8.21. Topology prediction showed that there is one Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase active site, two N-glycosylation sites, four Casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, seven Protein kinase C phosphorylation sites and eight N-myristoylation sites in the GAPDH protein of the Giant Panda. The GAPDH gene was overexpressed in E. coli BL21. The results indicated that the fusion of GAPDH with the N-terminally His-tagged form gave rise to the accumulation of an expected 43 kDa polypeptide. The SDS-PAGE analysis also showed that the recombinant GAPDH was soluble and thus could be used for further functional studies.
ABCB4 functions as a phosphatidylcholine translocater, flipping phosphatidylcholine across hepatocyte canalicular membranes into biliary canaliculi. In people, ABCB4 gene mutations are associated with several disease syndromes including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (type 3), primary biliary cirrhosis, and cholelithiasis. Hepatobiliary disease, specifically gallbladder mucocele formation, has been recognized with increased frequency in dogs during the past decade. Because Shetland Sheepdogs are considered to be predisposed to gallbladder mucoceles, we initially investigated ABCB4 as a candidate gene for gallbladder mucocele formation in that breed, but included affected dogs of other breeds as well.
PIK3CA and PTEN alterations are common in human cancer, but only a fraction of such tumors are dependent upon AKT signaling. AKT independence is associated with redundant activation of cap-dependent translation mediated by convergent regulation of the translational repressor 4E-BP1 by the AKT and ERK pathways. This provides mechanistic bases for the limited activity of AKT and MEK inhibitors in tumors with comutation of both pathways and the profound synergy observed with combined inhibition. Whereas such tumors are sensitive to a dominant active 4E-BP1 mutant, knockdown of 4E-BP1 expression reduces their dependence on AKT/ERK signaling for translation or survival. Thus, 4E-BP1 plays a prominent role in mediating the effects of these pathways in tumors in which they are activated by mutation.
NPR1 (Nonexpressor of Pathogenesis-Related gene 1) is a major co-activator of plant defense. Phosphorylations of NPR1 play important roles in fine-tuning its activity, however a kinase corresponding to such modification remains uncharacterized. Here, we report that NPR1 interacts with PKS5 (SOS2-like Protein Kinase 5). The AKR (AnKyrin Repeats) motif of NPR1 is required for this interaction. PKS5 phosphorylates NPR1 at the C-terminal region. Expression of PKS5 is induced quickly by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Expression level of two NPR1 target genes, WRKY38 and WRKY62, is reduced and/or delayed in pks5 mutants. Moreover, the expression of WRKY38 and WRKY62 displays a similar pattern in npr1-1pks5-1 double mutant comparing to that in npr1-1. Our results suggest that PKS5 functions at the upstream of NPR1 and might mediate expression of WRKY38 and WRKY62 possibly by interacting with and phosphorylating NPR1.
CYP2B6 is a highly inducible and polymorphic enzyme involved in the metabolism of an increasing number of clinically important drugs. Significant interindividual variability in CYP2B6 expression has been attributed to either genetic polymorphisms or chemical-mediated induction through the activation of constitutive androstane receptor and/or pregnane X receptor (PXR). It was reported that the -82T→C substitution within the CYP2B6*22 allele creates a functional CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) binding site and enhances the basal expression of the CYP2B6 gene. Here, we explored whether this polymorphic mutation could affect drug-mediated induction of CYP2B6. Cell-based promoter reporter assays demonstrated that CYP2B6 luciferase activity was synergistically enhanced in the presence of both -82T→C mutation and rifampicin (RIF)-activated PXR. On the other hand, this synergism was attenuated by disrupting the C/EBP binding site or knocking down C/EBPα expression. Mechanistic studies revealed that C/EBPα plays an important role in such synergism by directly interacting with PXR; enhancing RIF-mediated recruitment of PXR to the -82T→C harboring CYP2B6 promoter; and looping the PXR-bound distal phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module toward the proximal C/EBP binding site. Furthermore, the genotype-phenotype association was evaluated in cultured human primary hepatocytes from 44 donors. Interestingly, RIF-mediated induction of CYP2B6 in four -82T/C carriers was higher compared with that in the reference -82T/T homozygotes. Together, our results demonstrate, for the first time, a synergistic interplay between a CYP2B6 polymorphism and PXR-mediated induction, which may contribute to the large individual variations and inducibility of CYP2B6 in humans.
CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme that has both ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase activities, being capable of cleaving NAD(+) to cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR) and hydrolyzing cADPR to ADPR. It has been reported that there is markedly a reduction of cADPR and elevation of NAD in many tissues from CD38 knockout (CD38(-/-)) mice. Cyclic ADPR is a potent second messenger for intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, and NAD is a key cellular metabolite for cellular energetic and a crucial regulator for multiple signaling pathways in cells. We hypothesize that CD38 knockout may have a protective effect in oxidative stresses through elevating NAD and decreasing cADPR. In the present study, we observed that the mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from CD38(-/-) mice were significantly resistant to oxidative stress such as H(2)O(2) injury and hypoxia/reoxygenation compared with wild type MEFs (WT MEFs). We further found that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and concentrations of intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) in CD38(-/-) MEFs were markedly reduced compared with WT MEFs during hypoxia/reoxygenation. Coincidence with these results, a remarkably lower mRNA level of Nox1, one of the enzymes responsible for ROS generation, was observed in CD38(-/-) MEFs. Furthermore, we found that transcription of Nox1 mRNA in WT MEFs could be elevated by calcium ionophore ionomycin in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the expression of Nox1 mRNA can be regulated by elevation of intracellular [Ca(2+)]. Therefore we concluded that CD38(-/-) MEFs are resistant to oxidative stresses through inhibiting intracellular Ca(2+) overload and ROS production which may be regulated by Ca(2+)-mediated inhibition of Nox1 expression. Our data should provide an insight for elucidating the roles of CD38 in oxidative stresses and a novel perspective of dealing with the ischemia/reperfusion-related diseases.
SRM 1597 Complex Mixture of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons from Coal Tar, originally issued in 1987, was recently reanalyzed and reissued as SRM 1597a with 34 certified, 46 reference, and 12 information concentrations (as mass fractions) for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polycyclic aromatic sulfur heterocycles (PASHs) including methyl-substituted PAHs and PASHs. The certified and reference concentrations (as mass fractions) were based on results of analyses of the coal tar material using multiple analytical techniques including gas chromatography/mass spectrometry on four different stationary phases and reversed-phase liquid chromatography. SRM 1597a is currently the most extensively characterized SRM for PAHs and PASHs.
PNPLA3 (adiponutrin), a novel patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing enzyme, is expressed at high level in fat, but also in other tissues including liver. Polymorphisms in PNPLA3 have been linked to obesity and insulin sensitivity. Notably, a nonsynonymous variant rs738409(G) allele of the PNPLA3 gene was found to be strongly associated with both nonalcoholic and alcoholic fatty liver disease. We have generated Pnpla3(-/-) mice by gene targeting. Loss of Pnpla3 has no effect on body weight or composition, adipose mass, or development, whether the mice were fed regular chow or high-fat diet or bred into the genetic obese Lep(ob/ob) background. Plasma and liver triglyceride content and plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were not different between Pnpla3(+/+) and Pnpla3(-/-) mice while they were on regular chow, fed three different fatty liver-inducing diets, or after they were bred into Lep(ob/ob) background. Hepatic Pnpla5 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were similar in wild-type and Pnpla3(-/-) mice, although adipose Pnpla5 mRNA level was increased in Pnpla3(-/-) mice. A high-sucrose lipogenic diet stimulated hepatic Pnpla3 and Pnpla5 mRNA levels to a similar degree, but it did not affect adipose or liver triglyceride lipase (ATGL, known also as Pnpla2) mRNA in Pnpla3(+/+) and Pnpla3(-/-) mice. Finally, Pnpla3(+/+) and Pnpla3(-/-) mice displayed similar glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests while on regular chow or three different fatty liver-inducing diets.
HSD3B1 and HSD3B2 are crucial enzymes for the synthesis of hormonal steroids, including aldosterone. Therefore, HSD3B gene variations could possibly influence blood pressure (BP) by affecting the aldosterone level.
PAH concentrations have been determined in 47 seasonal snowpack samples collected in the Valbelluna valley and in the Bellunesi Dolomites National Park, in the Italian North-Eastern Alps, during the winter of 2005. The SigmaPAH concentration in high-altitude alpine sites (above 1700 m) was 32+/-20 ng/kg while in valley bottom urban areas it was 165+/-54 ng/kg with maximum values of 290 ng/kg. The GIS mapping technique was employed to produce a PAH spatial distribution. The urbanized Valbelluna valley, and in particular the SW part, had the highest accumulation of all PAH, with values an order of magnitude more than those in rural and alpine areas. This behaviour is consistent with urban air quality data, and is due to geo-morphological and meteorological factors such as the deeper shape of the valley at the position of the town of Feltre and the low altitude of the boundary layer during the winter season.
ABCG2 is a human membrane ATP-binding cassette half-transporter that hydrolyzes ATP to efflux a large number of chemotherapeutic agents. Several oligomeric states of ABCG2 from homodimers to dodecamers have been reported depending on the overexpression systems and/or the protocols used for purification. Here, we compared the oligomeric state of His(6)-ABCG2 expressed in Sf9 insect cells and in human Flp-In-293/ABCG2 cells after solubilization in mild detergents. His(6)-ABCG2 was purified through a new approach involving its specific recognition onto a functionalized lipid layer containing a Ni-NTA lipid. This approach allowed the purification of His-ABCG2 in presence of all solubilized membrane components that might be involved in the stabilisation of native oligomers and without requiring any additional washing or concentration passages. ABCG2 purified onto the NiNTA lipid surfaces were directly analyzed by electron microscopy and by biochemical assays. Altogether, our data are consistent with a tetrameric organization of ABCG2 when expressed in either heterologous Sf9 insect cells or in human homologous cells.
CYP3A4 receives electrons from P450 oxidoreductase (POR) to metabolize about 50% of clinically used drugs. There is substantial inter-individual variation in CYP3A4 catalytic activity that is not explained by CYP3A4 genetic variants. CYP3A4 is flexible and distensible, permitting it to accommodate substrates varying in shape and size. To elucidate the mechanisms of variability in CYP3A4 catalysis, we examined the effects of genetic variants of POR, and explored the possibility that substrate-induced conformational changes in CYP3A4 differentially affect the ability of POR variants to support catalysis.
CD36 is a multifunctional membrane receptor present on mononuclear phagocytes, platelets, and other cells that serves as a scavenger receptor for oxidized phospholipids, apoptotic cells and certain microbial pathogens. On macrophages, CD36 interaction with oxidized LDL (oxLDL) triggers a signaling response that is pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic. The signaling pathway involves activation of src-family kinases, MAP kinases, and Vav family guanine nucleotide exchange factors and results in ligand internalization, foam cell formation and inhibition of migration. On platelets, CD36 interaction with oxLDL and cell-derived microparticles transduces intracellular signals that render them more reactive to low concentrations of classical agonists. In vitro studies and in vivo experiments in CD36 null mice have revealed an important mechanistic role for CD36 in atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Identification of the precise CD36 signaling pathways in specific cells elicited in response to specific ligands may yield novel targets for drug development in athero-thrombotic disorders.
CYP2C8 with a modified N-terminal sequence (2C8H) crystallizes as a dimer, but it is not known whether native CYP2C8 exists as a dimer in natural membranes. We have examined the organization of 2C8H and CYP2C8 expressed in bacterial membranes and mammalian endoplasmic reticulum membranes, respectively, by cysteine scanning and cross-linking or oxidation of sulfhydryl groups. In both forms of CYP2C8, cross-linked dimers were observed that were eliminated by mutation of Cys-24 in the linker region. Introduction of individual cysteines in the N-terminal 21-amino acid membrane-spanning signal anchor resulted in a pattern of cross-linking consistent with an α-helical structure for the signal anchor. In the linker region, cross-linking was observed for cysteine substituted at residues 22, 23, or 24, just before three Arg residues, indicating close apposition of the two linker sequences despite the neighboring positive charges. Introduction into the F-G loop region of cysteine pairs optimally located for cross-linking based on the crystal structure resulted in cross-linked dimers in the Cys-24 mutant. Deletion of the signal anchor sequence eliminated cross-linking mediated by Cys-24 or by cysteines introduced in the F-G loop regions, indicating that the signal anchor interaction is required for stable dimer formation. These results indicate that the signal anchor sequence and the F-G loop region form interfaces for CYP2C8 intermolecular interactions in natural membranes.
ABO blood group accounts for up to 40% of the variability in plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels, which vary in the rank order AB > B > A > O > Bombay. This may be due in part to the influence of ABO-associated oligosaccharides on the proteolysis of VWF by the metalloprotease ADAMTS13, which is markedly deficient in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Using ABO blood group as a surrogate for baseline VWF levels as well as susceptibility to proteolysis by ADAMST13, we set out to determine whether ABO blood group influences the clinical course of TTP.
CYP1B1 is a P450 enzyme which is involved in the activation of pro-carcinogens to carcinogens as well as sex hormone metabolism. Because differences in the activity of the enzyme have been correlated with variant alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), it represents an attractive candidate gene for studies into colorectal cancer susceptibility.
ABCG2 is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter preferentially expressed by immature human hematopoietic progenitors. Due to its role in drug resistance, its expression has been correlated with a protection role against protoporhyrin IX (PPIX) accumulation in stem cells under hypoxic conditions. We show here that zinc mesoporphyrin, a validated fluorescent heme analog, is transported by ABCG2. We also show that the ABCG2 large extracellular loop ECL3 constitutes a porphyrin-binding domain, which strongly interacts with heme, hemin, PPIX, ZnPPIX, CoPPIX, and much less efficiently with pheophorbide a, but not with vitamin B12. K(d) values are in the range 0.5-3.5 μm, with heme displaying the highest affinity. Nonporphyrin substrates of ABCG2, such as mitoxantrone, doxo/daunorubicin, and riboflavin, do not bind to ECL3. Single-point mutations H583A and C603A inside ECL3 prevent the binding of hemin but hardly affect that of iron-free PPIX. The extracellular location of ECL3 downstream from the transport sites suggests that, after membrane translocation, hemin is transferred to ECL3, which is strategically positioned to release the bound porphyrin to extracellular partners. We show here that human serum albumin could be one of these possible partners as it removes hemin bound to ECL3 and interacts with ABCG2, with a K(d) of about 3 μm.
PGD for fragile X syndrome (FRAX) is inefficient, probably owing to fewer oocytes, poor embryo quality and difficulties in genetic analysis. We investigated IVF-PGD in FRAX mutation carriers compared with controls, looking at the effects of oocyte and embryo number/quality on live birth outcome.
GSTM1 takes part in the metabolism of environmental pollutants such as benzopyrene, other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and anticancer drugs and so on. The study aims to investigate the relationship between the gene polymorphism of GSTM1 and chemotherapy as well as to study the effect to survival of Chinese patients with lung cancer.
SLC5A8 (Solute carrier family 5, member 8), proposed to be a potential tumor suppressor gene, is down-regulated by epigenetic changes in some colorectal cancer cells, and ectopic expression of SLC5A8 in SLC5A8-deficient colon cancer cell lines leads to suppression of the colony-forming ability of these cells. Activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of tumor (and normal) human cell types. However, the mechanism(s) by which activin A exerts its inhibitory effects are not yet understood. In this study, we showed that activin A up-regulated SLC5A8 expression in colorectal cancer RKO cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. To elucidate the underlying mechanism involved in this process, we investigated the activation of the Smad signaling pathway, and analyzed the effects of dominant negative Smad3 and Smad2 proteins on activin A-induced SLC5A8 expression. The results indicated that activin A-induced SLC5A8 expression was dependent on activation of Smad3. Further analysis showed that activin A induced SLC5A8 expression via transcriptional activation. Deletion analysis indicated that the CAGA elements located within the -273/-222 region of the human SLC5A8 promoter were responsive to activin A. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that activin A up-regulates SLC5A8 expression through the Smad signaling pathway, which also partially explains the inhibitory effects of activin A in RKO cells.
ABCB1 and ABCG2 are efflux transporters which have a major impact on the pharmacological behavior of numerous drugs. They are expressed, for example, in the intestine, liver, kidney, BBB and placenta. It has become evident that ABCB1 and ABCG2 modify the pharmaco/toxicokinetics in the placenta and fetus and may consequently affect the outcome of pregnancy.
SOD1 is a cause of the fatal, paralytic disorder ALS. Although mechanisms underlying mutant SOD1 neurotoxicity remain uncertain, this protein associates with mitochondria. In this issue of Neuron, Israelson et al. show that mutant SOD1 binds and inhibits the mitochondrial channel VDAC1. This finding sheds light onto possible molecular links between mutant SOD1, mitochondrial dysfunction, and spinal motor neuron degeneration in inherited ALS.
RRM2 computational phosphoprotein network construction and analysis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is very useful to identify novel markers and potential targets for prognosis and therapy. By integration of gene regulatory network infer (GRNInfer) and the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID) we identified and constructed significant molecule RRM2 phosphoprotein network from 25 no-tumor hepatitis/cirrhotic liver tissues and 25 HCC patients in the same GEO Dataset GSE10140-10141. We gained the negative result of RRM2 phosphoprotein module through the net numbers of activation minus inhibition compared with no-tumor hepatitis/cirrhotic liver tissues and predicted possibly the decrease of RRM2 phosphoprotein module in HCC. Our integrative result showed that RRM2 phosphoprotein cluster of HCC contained both in human no-tumor hepatitis/cirrhotic liver tissues and HCC terms of phosphoprotein (with RRM2) and cell cycle (without RRM2), only in HCC terms of cell-cell signaling, cell projection part, glycoprotein, cell projection, cell adhesion, biological adhesion, integral to plasma membrane, plasma membrane, kinase and phosphorus metabolic process (without RRM2), and none in HCC terms of cell death (without RRM2) and ion binding (with RRM2) compared with human no-tumor hepatitis/cirrhotic liver tissues, all the condition is vital to invasion of HCC. Therefore, we deduced the weaker RRM2 phosphoprotein function in HCC consistent with our above computation. It would be necessary of RRM2 phosphoprotein function decrease to invasion of HCC. RRM2 phosphoprotein interaction module construction in HCC can be a new route for studying the pathogenesis of HCC.
CS (chondroitin sulfate) is a glycosaminoglycan species that is widely distributed in the extracellular matrix. To understand the physiological roles of enzymes involved in CS synthesis, we produced CSGalNAcT1 (CS N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1)-null mice. CS production was reduced by approximately half in CSGalNAcT1-null mice, and the amount of short-chain CS was also reduced. Moreover, the cartilage of the null mice was significantly smaller than that of wild-type mice. Additionally, type-II collagen fibres in developing cartilage were abnormally aggregated and disarranged in the homozygous mutant mice. These results suggest that CSGalNAcT1 is required for normal CS production in developing cartilage.
TH of infancy and early childhood is characterized by transiently increased S-ALP, predominantly its bone or liver isoforms. There are neither signs of metabolic bone disease or hepatopathy corresponding to the increased S-ALP, nor a common underlying/triggering disease. TH may also occur in children post-renal Tx, which may raise significant concerns and anxiety. We describe four patients aged 2.8-7 yr in whom the TH occurred at 11-34 (median = 28) months after Tx and lasted from 40 to 105 (median = 63) days. No obvious cause/trigger of TH could be found; the clinical status and bone turnover were not altered. In cases of TH post-Tx, we recommend the evaluation of basic biochemical indices and wrist X-ray. If these results are normal, TH is most likely the diagnosis and the S-ALP can be monitored over the next three months without further testing. In patients with persisting TH for more than three months and/or in children with pre-existing or suspected metabolic bone disease, further evaluation may be indicated. In conclusion, TH is a benign disorder in patients post-Tx. Detailed investigation including bone biopsy is only indicated in patients with persisting TH.
CYP3A4 is a dominant human liver cytochrome P450 enzyme engaged in the metabolism and disposition of >50% of clinically relevant drugs and held responsible for many adverse drug-drug interactions. CYP3A4 and its mammalian liver CYP3A orthologs are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored monotopic proteins that undergo ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent proteasomal degradation (UPD) in an ER-associated degradation (ERAD) process. These integral ER proteins are ubiquitinated in vivo, and in vitro studies have identified the ER-integral gp78 and the cytosolic co-chaperone, CHIP (C terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein), as the relevant E3 Ub-ligases, along with their cognate E2 Ub-conjugating enzymes UBC7 and UbcH5a, respectively. Using lentiviral shRNA templates targeted against each of these Ub-ligases, we now document that both E3s are indeed physiologically involved in CYP3A ERAD/UPD in cultured rat hepatocytes. Accordingly, specific RNAi resulted in ≈80% knockdown of each hepatic Ub-ligase, with a corresponding ≈2.5-fold CYP3A stabilization. Surprisingly, however, such stabilization resulted in increased levels of functionally active CYP3A, thereby challenging the previous notion that E3 recognition and subsequent ERAD of CYP3A proteins required ab initio their structural and/or functional inactivation. Furthermore, coexpression in HepG2 cells of both CYP3A4 and gp78, but not its functionally inactive RING-finger mutant, resulted in enhanced CYP3A4 loss greater than that in corresponding cells expressing only CYP3A4. Stabilization of a functionally active CYP3A after RNAi knockdown of either of the E3s, coupled with the increased CYP3A4 loss on gp78 or CHIP coexpression, suggests that ERAD-associated E3 Ub-ligases can influence clinically relevant drug metabolism by effectively regulating the physiological CYP3A content and consequently its function.
CA9 is proven to be a powerful marker for clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The studies on CA9 have been limited to solid renal cell carcinomas (RCC). We have conducted a study of CA9 expression in renal cystic tumors. The purpose of the present study was to extend the utility of CA9 for cystic renal tumors.
CYP2C9 is the major contributor to gliclazide metabolic clearance in vitro, while the pharmacokinetics of gliclazide modified release are affected mainly by CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms in vivo. This study aims to investigate the influence of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of gliclazide in healthy Chinese Han volunteers.
ABO blood type has been associated with various malignancies, including pancreatic cancer. Our aim was to study this association using data from a hospital-based tumour registry.
"PTEN is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. Mutations occur in either heritable or sporadic fashion. Sequencing of cDNA from patients and normal individuals often reveals splicing variants (SVs) of PTEN, some of which are non-mutation related. To investigate whether these SVs were the result of illegitimate splicing (a general decrease of fidelity in splicing site selection in ""aged"" samples), we tested ""aged"" blood from individuals who had normal PTEN transcripts in their ""fresh"" mononuclear cells. Blood from 20 normal individuals was collected and split into two aliquots. Total RNA and DNA were extracted immediately (""fresh"") and 48 h later (""aged""), respectively. Using RT-PCR, subcloning and sequencing, we found seven types of SVs. No mutation was detected in the related intron-exon flanking region in genomic DNA in either ""fresh"" or ""aged"" samples. Some of the SVs were also consistently present in both the ""fresh"" and ""aged"" EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells from six normal individuals. Western blot data indicated that the PTEN protein level (in full length) was not altered in the ""fresh"" EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells with SVs. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that PTEN illegitimate splicing often occurs in ""aged"" blood and EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells. Therefore, it is critical to note the time point of RNA extraction when investigating for PTEN aberrant transcripts. We hope that our data will increase awareness about the sample status, because gene expression data may be potentially flawed from ""aged"" samples, particularly when dealing with clinical samples."
ACE inhibition is an established treatment regimen in patients with congestive heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction which improves morbidity and mortality. However, little is known about the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition in adult patients after Mustard procedure for transposition of the great arteries with heart failure symptoms. Therefore, we investigated the effects of ACE inhibition in these patients on heart failure symptoms, echocardiographic diameters, NT-proBNP and exercise capacity.
CD36 is a Class B scavenger receptor that is constitutively expressed in the corneal epithelium and has been implicated in many homeostatic functions, including the homeostasis of the epidermal barrier. The aim of this study is to determine (1) whether CD36 is required for the maintenance of the corneal epithelial barrier to infection, and (2) whether CD36-deficient mice present with an increased susceptibility to bacterial keratitis.
CA3 pyramidal cells receive three main excitatory inputs: the first one is the mossy fiber input, synapsing mainly on the proximal apical dendrites. Second, entorhinal cortex cells form excitatory connections with CA3 pyramidal cells via the perforant path in the stratum lacunosum moleculare. The third input involves the ipsi-and contralateral connections, termed the associational/commissural (A/C) pathway terminating in the stratum radiatum of CA3, thus forming a feedback loop within this region. Since this excitatory recurrent synapse makes the CA3 region extremely prone to seizure development, understanding the regulation of synaptic strength of this connection is of crucial interest. Several studies suggest that kainate receptors (KAR) play a role in the regulation of synaptic strength. Our aim was to characterize the influence of KAR on A/C synaptic transmission: application of ATPA, a selective agonist of the GluK1 KAR, depressed the amplitude fEPSP without affecting the size of the fiber volley. Blockade of GABA receptors had no influence on this effect, arguing against the influence of interneuronal KARs. Pharmacological and genetic deletion studies could show that this effect was selectively due to GluK1 receptor activation. Several lines of evidence, such as PPF changes, coefficient of variance-analysis and glutamate uncaging experiments strongly argue for a presynaptic locus of suppression. This is accompanied by an ATPA-mediated reduction in Ca(2+) influx at excitatory synaptic terminals, which is most likely mediated by a G-Protein dependent mechanism, as suggested by application of pertussis toxin. Finally, analysis of miniature EPSCs in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca(2+) suggest that presynaptic KAR can also reduce transmitter release downstream and therefore independent of Ca(2+) influx.
ABCA3 mutations cause fatal surfactant deficiency and interstitial lung disease. ABCA3 protein is a lipid transporter indispensible for surfactant biogenesis and storage in lamellar bodies (LB). The protein folds in endoplasmic reticulum and is glycosylated in Golgi en route to the membrane of mature LB and their precursor multivesicular bodies (MVB). In immunoblots, C-terminally labeled ABCA3 appears as two protein bands of 150 and 190 kDa. Using N- and C-terminal protein tags and hindering ABCA3 processing we show that the 150 kDa protein represents the mature ABCA3 whose N-terminus is cleaved by a cysteine protease inside MVB/LB.
"ACE inhibitors have proven to be effective blood pressure lowering agents with an excellent tolerability profile. The family of these drugs is still expanding, necessitating the definition of selection criteria in order to choose the ""right drug"". In this article the ACE inhibitors available in the United Kingdom (UK) are scored by means of the SOJA method. The System of Objectified Judgement Analysis (SOJA) method is a model for rational drug selection. The relevant selection criteria for a certain group of drugs are defined and judged by a panel of experts and each selection criterion is given a relative weight. The more important that a selection criterion is considered, the higher the relative weight that is given to that criterion. The ideal properties for each selection criterion are determined and each drug is scored as a percentage of the score of the ideal drug for all selection criteria. The following selection criteria were used (relative weight): number of formulations (20), number of indications (20), variation in bioavailability (40), interactions (40), trough/peak ratio diastolic blood pressure lowering effect (20), efficacy (250), side-effects (150), dosage frequency (100), documentation (100) and effect on clinical endpoints (260). Ramipril showed the highest score, followed by perindopril, lisinopril and enalapril. The well documented effects on clinically relevant end points, such as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality contributed to the high score for ramipril."
CYP2D6 polymorphism is associated with variability in drug response, endogenous metabolism (that is, serotonin), personality, neurocognition and psychopathology. The relationship between CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism and the risk of eating disorders (ED) was analyzed in 267 patients with ED and in 285 controls. A difference in the CYP2D6 active allele distribution was found between these groups. Women carrying more than two active genes (ultrarapid metabolizers) (7.5 vs 4.6%) or two (67 vs 58.9%) active genes were more frequent among patients with ED, whereas those with one (20.6 vs 30.2%) or zero active genes (4.9 vs 6.3%) were more frequent among controls (P<0.05). Although further research is needed, present findings suggest an association between CYP2D6 and ED. CYP2D6 allele distribution in patients with ED seems related to increased enzyme activity.
CYP2B6 is a highly variable and polymorphic cytochrome P450 enzyme which plays a vital role in the degradation of some endogenous metabolites, xenobiotics, and harmful compounds. The 516G>T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 4 of CYP2B6 gene may change CYP2B6 enzyme activity and the gene expression in the liver. Carcinogens' failure to be degraded by CYP2B6 may cause DNA injury and cancer. Here, we aimed to evaluate the association between genotype or allele of CYP2B6 516G>T SNP and acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We recruited 300 patients including 164 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 96 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, including 17 cases of T-ALL and 79 cases of B-ALL), 40 cases of MDS, as well as 348 unrelated umbilical cord blood as the controls. Karyotype analysis and multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to determine different recurrent genetic abnormalities in these cases. Genotype of CYP2B6 516G>T SNP was determined by allele-specific primers PCR, and confirmed by gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The GT and GT + TT genotype frequencies of c.516G>T SNP were higher in ALL (37.5% and 42.7%, respectively, P < 0.01), and AML (37.2% and 40.9%, respectively, P < 0.01) than in control (23.9% and 25.9%, respectively). In the subtypes of acute leukemias, the GT + TT genotype frequency was significantly higher in AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities (41.7%, p < 0.05), in AML-NOS (40.6%, p < 0.01), in acute monoblastic and monocytic leukemia (48.3%, p < 0.01), and in T-ALL (70.6%, p < 0.01) as compared with those in the controls. The frequency of CYP2B6 516 T allele was higher in AML (22.3%, p < 0.01) and ALL (24.0%, p < 0.01) compared with cord blood (13.9%). In different types of acute leukemias, CYP2B6 516 T allele frequency was significantly higher in AML with AML1-ETO (19.2%, p < 0.05), AML-NOS (22.7%, p < 0.01), acute monoblastic and monocytic leukemia (25.9%, p < 0.01), and T-ALL (38.2%, p < 0.01). MDS was unrelated to the genotype and allele frequencies of c.516G>T SNP in CYP2B6. T allele of CYP2B6 516G>T SNP may be one of the risk factors predisposing to the pathogenesis of a majority of ALL and AML, but has no relationship with B-ALL and leukemia with or without chromosome abnormalities.
CYP1A2 metabolizes various drugs, endogenous compounds and procarcinogens. As human genetic diversity has been reported to decrease with distance from Ethiopia, we resequenced CYP1A2 in five Ethiopian ethnic groups representing a rough northeast to southwest transect across Ethiopia to establish: (i) what variation exists in comparison with what is already known globally and (ii) what CYP1A2 pharmacogenetic profiles may be present as several CYP1A2-metabolized drugs are administered to Ethiopians.
CYP1A1 is one of the commonest genes which had been widely investigated to find the risk of various malignancies in different ethnic groups. The polymorphism in these genes with a combination of environmental exposure has been hypothesized to confer a differential risk of cancer for individuals carrying these genetic variants. Based on this model, individuals with higher CYP1A1 activity would be at increased risk of cancer when exposed to high levels of smoke components. The proposed mechanism involves cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), a gene that is inducible by xenobiotics to produce genetic susceptibility for malignancies. PATIENTS AND PROCEDURES: We performed a case-control study in 205 cases with histopathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck and reported habits of bidi or cigarettes smoking and 245 similar controls to investigate the role of CYP1A1 polymorphisms in the risk of head and neck cancers especially among smokers of Hyderabad Indian population. Venous blood samples (5 ml) were collected from patients and control groups; genomic DNA was extracted and used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the genotypes. RFLP assays were designed to detect each of the variant CYP1A1 alleles.
SULT4A1 is a cytosolic sulfotransferase that shares little homology with other human sulfotransferases but is highly conserved between species. It is found in neurons located in several regions of the brain. Recently, the stability of SULT4A1 was shown to be regulated by Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. Since Pin1 binds preferentially to phosphoproteins, these findings suggested that SULT4A1 is post-translationally modified. In this study, we show that the Thr(11) residue of SULT4A1, which is involved in Pin1 binding is phosphorylated. MEK inhibition was shown to abolish Pin1 mediated degradation of SULT4A1 while in vitro phosphorylation assays using alanine substitution mutants of SULT4A1 demonstrated phosphorylation of Thr(11) by ERK1. We also show that dephosphorylation was catalyzed by the protein phosphatase 2A. The PP2A regulatory subunit, Bβ was identified from a yeast-2-hybrid screen of human brain cDNA as a SULT4A1 interacting protein. This was further confirmed by GST pull-downs and immunoprecipitation. Other members of the B subunit (αδγ) did not interact with SULT4A1. Taken together, these studies indicate that SULT4A1 stability is regulated by post-translational modification that involves the ERK pathway and PP2A. The phosphorylation of SULT4A1 allows interaction with Pin1, which then promotes degradation of the sulfotransferase.
CA1 cells receive direct input from space-responsive cells in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), such as grid cells, as well as more nonspatial cells in lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). Because MEC projects preferentially to the proximal part of the CA1, bordering CA2, whereas LEC innervates only the distal part, bordering subiculum, we asked if spatial tuning is graded along the transverse axis of CA1. Tetrodes were implanted along the entire proximodistal axis of dorsal CA1 in rats. Data were recorded in cylinders large enough to elicit firing at more than one location in many neurons. Distal CA1 cells showed more dispersed firing and had a larger number of firing fields than proximal cells. Phase-locking of spikes to MEC theta oscillations was weaker in distal CA1 than in proximal CA1. The findings suggest that spatial firing in CA1 is organized transversally, with the strongest spatial modulation occurring in the MEC-associated proximal part.
NPR1 is a central regulator of salicylic-acid (SA)-mediated defense signaling in Arabidopsis. Here, we report the characterization of OsNPR1, an Oryzae sativa (rice) ortholog of NPR1, focusing on its role in blast disease resistance and identification of OsNPR1-regulated genes. Blast resistance tests using OsNPR1 knockdown and overexpressing rice lines demonstrated the essential role of OsNPR1 in benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced blast resistance. Genome-wide transcript profiling using OsNPR1-knockdown lines revealed that 358 genes out of 1,228 BTH-upregulated genes and 724 genes out of 1,069 BTH-downregulated genes were OsNPR1-dependent with respect to BTH responsiveness, thereby indicating that OsNPR1 plays a more vital role in gene downregulation. The OsNPR1-dependently downregulated genes included many of those involved in photosynthesis and in chloroplast translation and transcription. Reduction of photosynthetic activity after BTH treatment and its negation by OsNPR1 knockdown were indeed reflected in the changes in Fv/Fm values in leaves. These results imply the role of OsNPR1 in the reallocation of energy and resources during defense responses. We also examined the OsNPR1-dependence of SA-mediated suppression of ABA-induced genes.
SLC25A13 gene mutations cause citrin deficiency, which leads to neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD). Information on the mutation spectrum of SLC25A13 in the Chinese population is limited. The aim of this study was to explore the mutation spectrum of the SLC25A13 gene in Chinese infants with intrahepatic cholestasis and various forms of aminoacidemia.
CLC proteins transport chloride (Cl(-)) ions across cell membranes to control the electrical potential of muscle cells, transfer electrolytes across epithelia, and control the pH and electrolyte composition of intracellular organelles. Some members of this protein family are Cl(-) ion channels, whereas others are secondary active transporters that exchange Cl(-) ions and protons (H(+)) with a 2:1 stoichiometry. We have determined the structure of a eukaryotic CLC transporter at 3.5 angstrom resolution. Cytoplasmic cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) domains are strategically positioned to regulate the ion-transport pathway, and many disease-causing mutations in human CLCs reside on the CBS-transmembrane interface. Comparison with prokaryotic CLC shows that a gating glutamate residue changes conformation and suggests a basis for 2:1 Cl(-)/H(+) exchange and a simple mechanistic connection between CLC channels and transporters.
CYP1A2 play an important role in the metabolism of many carcinogens and clinically important drugs. CYP1A2 activity has been found to be influenced by the presence of polymorphic variants which were reported to display wide interethnic variation. This study investigates the frequency distribution and linkage disequilibrium patterns of CYP1A2 genetic polymorphisms, and characterize their haplotype structures in three healthy Asian populations in Singapore (Chinese, Malay, and Indian). The entire CYP1A2 gene was screened in 126 healthy subjects from all three ethnic groups (N=42 each). A total of 25 polymorphisms was identified, of which nine were novel. The polymorphisms, -2467delT and -163C>A were detected at high frequencies in all Asian ethnic groups. Significant interethnic differences were observed in the genotypic frequency distribution of IVS2-99G>A (P<0.01) and 1548C>T (P=0.05) across the three ethnic groups while -163C>A (P=0.02) was found to differ between Chinese and Malays. Haplotype analyses revealed four to six major haplotypes in each ethnic population which accounted for more than 60% of the cumulative haplotype frequencies. Future studies should be done to investigate the functional roles of these haplotypes.
CD36 is a scavenger receptor known to play a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis by mediating the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) by macrophages, thus leading to foam cell formation. It is now generally recognized that the immune system has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, whose progression is determined by ongoing inflammatory reactions. Recently, several studies pointed out that opioid peptides exert anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore the aim of the present study was to evaluate a possible endomorphin-1 (EM-1) immunomodulatory activity on human foam cells. Our results showed that EM-1 reduced Nile Red-stained lipid droplets content, decreased the expression of CD36 receptor and modulated tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release from lipid-laden macrophages. Furthermore, Naloxone, an opioid receptors antagonist, reverted the anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory observed effects of EM-1. These data demonstrated, for the first time, an unprecedented ability of EM-1 to act as a novel modulator for macrophage-to-foam cell transformation, and for inflammatory cytokines profile, suggesting possible novel endomorphin-based anti-atherosclerotic approaches for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.
PLA2G6 is the causative gene for infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, neurodegeneration associated with brain iron accumulation, and Karak syndrome. Based on previous reports, patients with PLA2G6 mutations could show axonal dystrophy, dystonia, dementia, and cerebellar signs. Recently, PLA2G6 was also reported as the causative gene for early-onset PARK14-linked dystonia-parkinsonism.
PIK3CA mutations are frequent in breast cancer and activate the PI3K/Akt pathway. Unexpectedly, PIK3CA mutation appears in general to be associated with better outcome. In a cohort of patients where both primary and metastatic lesions were available, the objective was to assess changes in PIK3CA mutations. We wished to discern whether selective pressures occur and the influence of PIK3CA mutation on time to recurrence.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) loss of function is the most common genetic aberration in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas. In addition to its well-described role in cell signaling, PTEN is involved in the maintenance of genomic stability. Loss of PTEN function causes defects in repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination and, therefore, sensitizes cells to inhibition of the poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP). Here, we determined the PTEN status of eight endometrioid endometrial carcinoma cell lines and correlated it with in vitro sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor KU0058948. PTEN-deficient cells showed a significantly greater sensitivity to KU0058948 than the two endometrioid endometrial carcinoma cell lines with wild-type PTEN. The cell lines lacking PTEN expression were unable to elicit a homologous recombination damage response as assayed by RAD51 focus function (a marker of competent homologous recombination DNA repair) upon irradiation and treatment with PARP inhibitors. PTEN silencing in PTEN wild-type Hec-1b cells resulted in reduced RAD51 foci formation after DNA damage and increased sensitivity to PARP inhibition. PTEN reexpression in PTEN-null cell lines resulted in enhanced RAD51 foci formation and in relative resistance to KU0058948. Given that up to 80% of endometrioid endometrial cancers lack PTEN expression, our results suggest that PARP inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for a subset of endometrioid endometrial cancers.
CD36 is the receptor for long chain fatty acids (LCFA), and is expressed in lingual taste cells from rodents. In these animals, CD36 has been proposed to play an important role in oral detection of LCFA, and subsequently, determines their dietary fat preference. Humans also seem to detect LCFA in the oral cavity, however, information on the molecular mechanism of this human orosensory LCFA recognition is currently lacking. The aim of our study was to investigate whether CD36 is also expressed in lingual human and porcine taste buds cells. Using fluorescence immunohistochemistry, apical CD36 expression was revealed in human and porcine taste bud cells from circumvallate and foliate papillae. These data suggest CD36 as the putative orosensory receptor for dietary LCFA in human, and, therefore, may be involved in our preference for fatty foods.
MTHFR C677T and Helicobacter pylori infection are believed to play critical roles in the DNA methylation process, an epigenetic feature frequently found in gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to verify the associations between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and the methylation status of three gastric cancer-related genes. The influence of H. pylori strains was also assessed. DNA extracted from 71 gastric tumor samples was available for MTHFR C677T genotyping by PCR-RFLP, promoter methylation identification by MS-PCR and H. pylori detection and posterior subtyping (cagA and vacA genes) by PCR. In the distal tumors, a positive correlation was found between the methylation of CDKN2A and the allele T carriers (r=0.357; p=0.009). Considering the eldest patients (age ≥60 years old), this correlation was even higher (r=0,417; p=0.014). H. pylori infection by highly pathogenic strains (cagA+/vacAs1m1) was also found correlated to promoter methylation of CDKN2A and the allele T carriers in distal tumors (r=0.484; p=0.026). No significant correlation was verified between MTHFR C677T genotype and promoter methylation status when we analyzed the general sample. DNA methylation in CDKN2A associated to the MTHFR 677T carrier is suggested to be a distal tumor characteristic, especially in those 60 years old or older, and it seems to depend on the infection by H. pylori cagA/vacAs1m1 strains.
PGD has been described in previous cross-sectional and retrospective studies as a stressful experience. No prospective studies of the psychological impact of PGD are currently available.
CD36 variants have been associated with type 2 diabetes, features of the metabolic syndrome, and alterations in lipid metabolism. In contrast, the effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CD36 on insulin resistance is controversial in literature. Therefore, we investigated whether genetic variation within the CD36 gene locus affects insulin resistance in a well-phenotyped cohort of white European subjects at increased risk for type 2 diabetes. We genotyped 1,790 subjects (1,174 women, 616 men) for six SNPs tagging 100% of common variants (minor allele frequency ≥0.05) within the CD36 gene locus with an r² ≥ 0.8. All subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a subset additionally a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (n = 523). Ectopic hepatic lipids (n = 346) were assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After appropriate adjustment and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, the four CD36 SNPs rs9784998, rs3211883, rs3211908, and rs3211956 significantly associated with BMI and rs3211883 and rs3211908 significantly associated with waist circumference (all P < 0.0042). In contrast, CD36 SNPs rs3211816 and rs3211960 were not associated with measures of adiposity (all P ≥ 0.11). No reliable association was detected between the six CD36 SNPs and insulin sensitivity or ectopic hepatic lipid accumulation after adjustment for age, gender, and BMI. In the long run, genetic variation within the CD36 locus may contribute to metabolic disease via its effect on body adiposity, but not via an independent effect on insulin sensitivity.
CYP2E1 encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes which play a central role in activating and detoxifying many carcinogens and endogenous compounds thought to be involved in the development of cancer. The PstI/RsaI and DraI polymorphism are two of the most commonly studied polymorphisms of the gene for their association with risk of head and neck cancer, but the results are conflicting.
SLC2A9 is a novel identified urate transporter influencing uric acid metabolism. It has been suggested that the single-nucleotide polymorphisms in SLC2A9 may affect the serum UA levels. The present study was designed to investigate rs6855911 polymorphism in intron 7 of SLC2A9 in a total of 372 Chinese male subjects. We examined 166 gout patients, as well as 206 healthy male volunteers in this study. DNA was purified from peripheral blood, and the rs6855911 polymorphism was evaluated using high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis and direct sequencing. Demographic and clinical data obtained from the patients and controls among the genotype groups were analyzed. A/A and A/G genotypes were unambiguously distinguished with HRM technology. The occurrence of the homozygous type (G/G) was completely absent among the study population. The prevalence of the A/A and A/G genotype was 96.0% and 4.0%, respectively. Genotyping based on HRM was fully concordant with sequencing. The G allele frequency was significantly higher in the low-uric-acid group than in the high-uric-acid group. The genotype distribution and allele frequencies were not significantly different between gout and control subjects (p = 0.04). However, serum uric acid levels in the A/G genotype subjects were significantly lower than those with the A/A genotypes (p < 0.01). Rapid and accurate genotyping analysis of SLC2A9 can be done with HRM. The polymorphism rs6855911 in SLC2A9 may be a genetic marker to assess risk of hyperuricemia among Chinese male Han population.
RRM1 is a determinant of gemcitabine efficacy in cancer patients. However, the precision of predicting tumor response based on RRM1 levels is not optimal. We used gene-specific overexpression and RNA interference to assess RRM1's impact on different classes of cytotoxic agents, on drug-drug interactions, and the modulating impact of other molecular and cellular parameters. RRM1 was the dominant determinant of gemcitabine efficacy in various cancer cell lines. RRM1 also impacted the efficacy of other antimetabolite agents. It did not disrupt the interaction of two cytotoxic agents when combined. Cell lines with truncation, deletion, and null status of p53 were resistant to gemcitabine without apparent relationship to RRM1 levels. Pemetrexed and carboplatin sensitivity did not appear to be related to p53 mutation status. The impact of p53 mutations in patients treated with gemcitabine should be studied in prospective clinical trials to develop a model with improved precision of predicting drug efficacy.
CD36 is a membrane glycoprotein expressed on platelets, monocytes, macrophages, and several other cell types that was recently demonstrated to be involved in platelet activation in response to oxidized phospholipids, including oxidized LDL. Although the role of CD36 in other vascular cells has not been well defined, previous studies have demonstrated that cd36-knockout (cd36-/-) mice have prolonged thrombosis times after vascular injury, which can be protective in the state of hyperlipidemia. Here, we found significantly less ROS in the vessel walls of cd36-/- mice compared with WT after chemically induced arterial injury, suggesting that CD36 may contribute to ROS generation in the VSMCs themselves. Gene expression analysis revealed that the antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxin-2 (Prdx2) and heme oxygenase-1 were upregulated in cd36-/- VSMCs. Molecular dissection of the pathway in isolated mouse VSMCs revealed CD36 ligand-dependent induction of Fyn phosphorylation, with subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments further showed that Nrf2 directly occupied the Prdx2 promoter. The importance of this pathway was evidenced by increased ROS generation in prdx2-/- mice and decreased thrombosis times in both prdx2-/- and nrf2-/- mice after vascular injury. These data suggest that CD36-mediated downregulation of antioxidant systems in VSMCs may contribute to its prothrombotic, proinflammatory, and atherogenic effects.
DCK catalyzes the intracellular phosphorylation of fludarabine. The promoter and coding region of the DCK gene were analyzed in 74 follicular lymphoma (FL) patients receiving a therapeutic regimen that included fludarabine. DCK mRNA expression was quantified in a cohort of healthy donors. Four previously described genotypic variants, -360C>G, -201C>T (rs2306744), C28624T (rs11544786) and c.91+37G>C (rs9997790), as well as the new variant, -12C>G, were identified. Variant C28624T showed a lower risk of lymphopenia (P=0.04), but a higher risk of neutropenia (P=0.04). Statistical significance was found in bivariate logistic regression between lymphopenia and infectious episodes in the induction period (odds ratio 3.85, P=0.04).
CFTR gene mutations have worldwide differences in prevalence and data on Chilean patients is scarce.
CYP3A5 is a member of the CYP3A gene family which metabolizes 50% of therapeutic drugs and steroid hormones. CYP3A5*3 and CYP3A5*6 polymorphisms exhibit inter-individual differences in CYP3A5 expression. The CYP3A5*3 allele (A6986G transition in intron 3) results in loss of CYP3A5 expression and the CYP3A5*6 allele (G14690A transition in exon 2, leading to the skipping of exon 7) is associated with lower CYP3A5 catalytic activity. The aim of the present study was to investigate their influence on susceptibility to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). 265 CML cases and 241 age and sex matched healthy controls were analyzed by the PCR-RFLP technique. The frequencies of homozygous 3/3 genotype and CYP3A5*3 allele were elevated significantly in the CML group compared to controls (χ²=93.15, df=2, p=0.0001). With respect to clinical parameters, CYP3A5*3 allele frequency was increased in patients with advanced phase of the disease (0.71) as compared to those in chronic phase (0.65). Patients without hematological response (minor/poor) had higher frequency of 3/3 genotype (54.54%) as compared to those with major hematological response (41.2%). CYP3A5*6 allele was not observed in cases as well as in controls. Our study suggests that the CYP3A5*3 gene polymorphism is significantly associated with the risk of CML development and disease progression.
FUT2 is an autosomal gene that controls the secretion of the ABH blood group antigens in organic fluids. The secretor gene plays an important role during intrauterine life. The aim of this study is to investigate a possible association between the ABH system and reproductive success in couples with primary repeated spontaneous abortion (RSA).
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten)/PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/Akt/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway, which is commonly dysregulated in a broad array of human malignancies, controls the assembly of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex through regulation of eIF4E binding proteins (4E-BPs) phosphorylation. And accumulated data over the past two decades implicated eIF4F complex as one of the promising targets for anticancer therapy. It has been confirmed that the translation initiation of mRNA coding for hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and survivin, which had been considered as the two major determinants of tumor radiosensitivity, are both controlled by eIF4F complex. Also, eIF4F complex controls the expression of VEGF and bFGF, the two well-known pro-angiogenic factors involved in developing radioresistance. Therefore eIF4F complex plays a pivotal role in regulation of radiosensitivity. In this article, we postulate that cell-permeable, phosphorylation-defective 4E-BP fusion proteins, which could be prepared by substituting the mTOR recognition motif located in N-terminal of 4E-BPs with protein transduction domain from HIV-1 TAT, HSV-1 VP22 or PTD4, could not only inhibit tumor growth but also enhance tumor response to radiation therapy through disruption of eIF4F complex assembly. In our opinion, the recombinant fusion proteins are superior to mTOR inhibitors for they do not cause immunosuppression, do not lead to Akt activation, and could be easily prepared by prokaryotic expression. If the hypothesis was proved to be practical, the cell-permeable, phosphorylation-defective 4E-BP fusion proteins would be widely used in clinical settings to improve tumor response to radiotherapy in the near future.
CYP2C19 is a drug-metabolizing enzyme showing various genetic polymorphisms that may cause marked interindividual and interethnic variability in the disposition of its substrates. We assessed CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms in a Korean population using a newly developed multiplex pyrosequencing method.
CYP2C8 is involved in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase pathway. Arachidonic acid metabolites such as epoxyeicosatrienenoic acids and hydroxyeicosatetrenoic acids, produced may have a role in hypertension. We aimed to develop a medium through-put method for screening samples of known and new mutations of CYP2C8 using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC).
PNPLA3 (adiponutrin, calcium-independent phospholipase A(2) epsilon [iPLA(2)ε]) is an adipose-enriched, nutritionally regulated protein that belongs to the patatin-like phospholipase domain containing (PNPLA) family of lipid metabolizing proteins. Genetic variations in the human PNPLA3 gene (i.e., the rs738409 I148M allele) has been strongly and repeatedly associated with fatty liver disease. Although human PNPLA3 has triacylglycerol (TAG) hydrolase and transacylase activities in vitro, its in vivo function and physiological relevance remain controversial. The objective of this study was to determine the metabolic consequences of global targeted deletion of the Pnpla3 gene in mice. We found that Pnpla3 mRNA expression is altered in adipose tissue and liver in response to acute and chronic nutritional challenges. However, global targeted deletion of the Pnpla3 gene in mice did not affect TAG hydrolysis, nor did it influence energy/glucose/lipid homoeostasis or hepatic steatosis/injury. Experimental interventions designed to increase Pnpla3 expression (refeeding, high-sucrose diet, diet-induced obesity, and liver X receptor agonism) likewise failed to reveal differences in the above-mentioned metabolic phenotypes. Expression of the Pnpla3 paralog, Pnpla5, was increased in adipose tissue but not in liver of Pnpla3-deficient mice, but compensatory regulation of genes involved in TAG metabolism was not identified. Together these data argue against a role for Pnpla3 loss-of-function in fatty liver disease or metabolic syndrome in mice.
CYP2S1 is a recently described dioxin-inducible cytochrome P450. We previously demonstrated that human CYP2S1 oxidizes a number of carcinogens but only via the peroxide shunt. In this article, we investigated whether human CYP2S1 can metabolize cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-derived lipid peroxides in a NADPH-independent fashion. Human CYP2S1 metabolizes prostaglandin G(2) (PGG(2)) (K(m) = 0.267 ± 0.072 μM) into several products including 12S-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHT). It also metabolizes prostaglandin H(2) (PGH(2)) (K(m) = 11.7 ± 2.8 μM) into malondialdehyde, 12-HHT, and thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)). The turnover to 12-HHT by human CYP2S1 (1.59 ± 0.04 min(-1)) is 40-fold higher than that of TXA(2) (0.04 min(-1)). In addition to PGG(2) and PGH(2) metabolism, human CYP2S1 efficiently metabolizes the hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (5S-, 12S-, and 15S-) and 13S-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid into 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (turnover = 16.7 ± 0.3 min(-1)), 12-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid 1 (11.5 ± 0.9 min(-1)), 15-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (16.9 ± 0.8 min(-1)), and 13-octadecadienoic acid (20.2 ± 0.9 min(-1)), respectively. Other cytochromes P450 such as CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, and 3A4 underwent similar conversions but at slower rates. The fatty acid hydroperoxides were also converted by human CYP2S1 to several epoxyalcohols. Our data indicate that fatty acid endoperoxides and hydroperoxides represent endogenous substrates of CYP2S1 and suggest that the enzyme CYP2S1 may play an important role in the inflammatory process because some of the products that CYP2S1 produces play important roles in inflammation.
CYP17A1 encodes the key enzyme of androgen biosynthesis, P450c17. The gene is expressed in a number of steroidogenic tissues among them testis, ovary, placenta and adrenal gland. The proper analysis of CYP17A1 expression and of epigenetic parameters however, is hampered by the presence of more than one copy of the gene within the bovine genome. Therefore, as a prerequisite for future studies we characterized these copies and analyzed their promoter methylation and expression profiles in different tissues. DNA methylation levels were determined by bisulfite modification, amplification, cloning and sequencing. Transcription was analyzed by RT-PCR. From bovine genomic DNA three different CYP17A1 promoter sequences could be amplified with a sequence similarity of 94.8%, 95.6% and 98.7%. Based on these sequences we could reconstruct, by in silico analysis, the promoter regions and eight potentially coding exons of two loci, CYP17A1a and CYP17A1b, and the promoter region and truncated first exon of a third locus, CYP17A1x. By using locus-specific primers, only transcripts of CYP17A1a, but not of CYP17A1b could be detected in testis, epididymis, theca, corpus luteum, placental cotyledons, adrenal gland and preoptic brain area. Methylation analysis revealed that only the CYP17A1a promoter was hypo-methylated in the tested P450c17 active tissues, whereas both other copies showed higher levels of methylation. From these data we conclude that the bovine genome contains three paralogous copies of the CYP17A1 gene, of which two (CYP17A1b and CYP17A1x) might be silenced by epigenetic modification (promoter methylation).
TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines. The cat-2 gene of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is expressed in mechanosensory dopaminergic neurons and has been proposed to encode a putative TH. In the present paper, we report the cloning of C. elegans full-length cat-2 cDNA and a detailed biochemical characterization of the encoded CAT-2 protein. Similar to other THs, C. elegans CAT-2 is composed of an N-terminal regulatory domain followed by a catalytic domain and a C-terminal oligomerization domain and shows high substrate specificity for L-tyrosine. Like hTH (human TH), CAT-2 is tetrameric and is phosphorylated at Ser35 (equivalent to Ser40 in hTH) by PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase). However, CAT-2 is devoid of characteristic regulatory mechanisms present in hTH, such as negative co-operativity for the cofactor, substrate inhibition or feedback inhibition exerted by catecholamines, end-products of the pathway. Thus TH activity in C. elegans displays a weaker regulation in comparison with the human orthologue, resembling a constitutively active enzyme. Overall, our data suggest that the intricate regulation characteristic of mammalian TH might have evolved from more simple models to adjust to the increasing complexity of the higher eukaryotes neuroendocrine systems.
ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) 2 is expressed in the heart and kidney and metabolizes Ang (angiotensin) II to Ang-(1-7) a peptide that acts via the Ang-(1-7) or mas receptor. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of Ang-(1-7) on blood pressure and cardiac remodelling in a rat model of renal mass ablation. Male SD (Sprague-Dawley) rats underwent STNx (subtotal nephrectomy) and were treated for 10 days with vehicle, the ACE inhibitor ramipril (oral 1 mg·kg(-1) of body weight·day(-1)) or Ang-(1-7) (subcutaneous 24 μg·kg(-1) of body weight·h(-1)) (all n = 15 per group). A control group (n = 10) of sham-operated rats were also studied. STNx rats were hypertensive (P<0.01) with renal impairment (P<0.001), cardiac hypertrophy (P<0.001) and fibrosis (P<0.05), and increased cardiac ACE (P<0.001) and ACE2 activity (P<0.05). Ramipril reduced blood pressure (P<0.01), improved cardiac hypertrophy (P<0.001) and inhibited cardiac ACE (P<0.001). By contrast, Ang-(1-7) infusion in STNx was associated with further increases in blood pressure (P<0.05), cardiac hypertrophy (P<0.05) and fibrosis (P<0.01). Ang-(1-7) infusion also increased cardiac ACE activity (P<0.001) and reduced cardiac ACE2 activity (P<0.05) compared with STNx-vehicle rats. Our results add to the increasing evidence that Ang-(1-7) may have deleterious cardiovascular effects in kidney failure and highlight the need for further in vivo studies of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/mas receptor axis in kidney disease.
ALOX12 produces ligands for PPARγ thereby turning mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes instead of osteoblasts. We investigated the effect of polymorphisms in the ALOX12 gene on BMD and fracture risk in two Danish cohorts and found four polymorphisms and a haplotype thereof to be associated with BMD and fracture risk.
ELOVL2 is a member of the mammalian microsomal ELOVL fatty acid enzyme family, involved in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids including PUFAs required for various cellular functions in mammals. Here, we used ELOVL2-ablated (Elovl2(-/-)) mice to show that the PUFAs with 24-30 carbon atoms of the ω-6 family in testis are indispensable for normal sperm formation and fertility in male mice. The lack of Elovl2 was associated with a complete arrest of spermatogenesis, with seminiferous tubules displaying only spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes without further germinal cells. Furthermore, based on acyl-CoA profiling, heterozygous Elovl2(+/-) male mice exhibited haploinsufficiency, with reduced levels of C28:5 and C30:5n-6 PUFAs, which gave rise to impaired formation and function of haploid spermatides. These new insights reveal a novel mechanism involving ELOVL2-derived PUFAs in mammals and previously unrecognized roles for C28 and C30 n-6 PUFAs in male fertility. In accordance with the function suggested for ELOVL2, the Elovl2(-/-) mice show distorted levels of serum C20 and C22 PUFAs from both the n-3 and the n-6 series. However, dietary supplementation with C22:6n-3 could not restore male fertility to Elovl2(+/-) mice, suggesting that the changes in n-6 fatty acid composition seen in the testis of the Elovl2(+/-) mice, cannot be compensated by increased C22:6n-3 content.
CYP27B1 encodes mitochondrial 1α-hydroxylase, which converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to its active 1,25-dihydroxylated metabolite. We tested the hypothesis that common variants in the CYP27B1 promoter are associated with fracture risk. The study was designed as a population-based genetic association study, which involved 153 men and 596 women aged 65-101 years, who had been followed for 2.2 years (range 0.1-5.5) between 1999 and 2006. During the follow-up period, the incidence of fragility fractures was ascertained. Bone ultrasound attenuation (BUA) was measured in all individuals, as were serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and PTH concentrations; 86% subjects had vitamin D insufficiency. Genotypes were determined for the -1260C>A (rs10877012) and +2838T>C (rs4646536) CYP27B1 polymorphisms. A reporter gene assay was used to assess functional expression of the -1260C>A CYP27B1 variants. The association between genotypes and fracture risk was analyzed by Cox's proportional hazards model. We found that genotypic distribution of CYP27B1 -1260 and CYP27B1 +2838 polymorphisms was consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium law. The two polymorphisms were in high linkage disequilibrium, with D' = 0.96 and r² = 0.94. Each C allele of the CYP27B1 -1260 polymorphism was associated with increased risk of fracture (hazard ratio = 1.34, 95% CI 1.03-1.73), after adjustment for age, sex, number of falls, and BUA. In transient transfection studies, a reporter gene downstream of the -1260(A)-containing promoter was more highly expressed than that containing the C allele. These data suggest that a common but functional variation within the CYP27B1 promoter gene is associated with fracture risk in the elderly.
CPS1 is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step of the urea cycle, the primary system for removing nitrogen produced by protein metabolism using N-acetylglutamate. Patients with CPS1 deficiency have severe hyperammonemia that results in serious neurologic sequelae and sometimes death. LT has been indicated for neonatal-onset CPS1 deficiency. This study retrospectively reviewed five children with a diagnosis of CPS1 deficiency who underwent LDLT from heterozygous donors. Between November 2005 and May 2010, 124 children underwent LDLT with an overall patient and graft survival of 91.0%. Five patients were indicated for LDLT because of CPS1 deficiency. All recipients achieved resolution of their metabolic derangement, without donor complication, with a normal feeding regimen without medication for their original metabolic liver disease. LDLT, even from heterozygous donors, appears to be a feasible option, associated with a better quality of life for treating patients with CPS1 deficiency. Long-term observation may therefore be necessary to collect sufficient data to confirm the efficacy of this treatment modality.
CDA is a heterogeneous group of disorders that result in morphologically abnormal erythroid maturation and ineffective erythropoiesis. Curative therapy for CDA focuses on the use of HSCT using fully matched sibling donors. This is the first report of a Type II CDA patient with severe iron overload who was successfully treated with HSCT using a HLA-matched unrelated donor after aggressive chelation therapy. Given the challenges of HSCT in any patient with CDA and severe iron overload, the role of novel approaches to iron chelation and HSCT is discussed.
MGAT5 was demonstrated to be associated to multiple sclerosis (MS) severity. We evaluated its role in progressive MS. We studied 11 SNPs mapping to MGAT5 in an Italian cohort of primary progressive or progressive-relapsing patients. The rs1257169(G) allele is associated with lower disease severity (p-value = 0.02). Adding the age of onset as covariate, another SNP, rs539588, is nominally significant. None of the SNPs survived after multiple testing correction. These results, even if suggestive of MGAT5 involvement also in progressive MS severity, require a bigger sample size to confirm and better explore the role of this locus in this rare disease course.
CD36 is a transmembrane protein present in many tissues that is believed to facilitate inward fatty acid transport. Western blotting is the most widely used method to measure tissue CD36 protein content, but it is time consuming, technically demanding, and semiquantitative. To more precisely measure adipose tissue CD36 content we developed an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after establishing that: 1) the anti-CD36 antibodies gave a single distinct band on traditional Western blots, and 2) the vast majority of adipocyte CD36 resides in the plasma membrane. By using serial dilutions of each sample and including a calibrator sample and quality control sample on each plate, we could achieve inter- and intra-assay variability of ∼ 10%. We found that CD36 content in omental and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue varied over a 2-5-fold range depending upon the means of data expression (per units of tissue protein, weight, or lipid). Omental CD36 content in women decreased markedly (P = 0.01) as a function of fat cell size. For the most part, tissue CD36 content was not correlated with CD36 mRNA. This ELISA method for tissue CD36 content should enhance research into the role of this protein on tissue fatty acid uptake.
ABO blood groups and secretor status are important in clinical and forensic medicine and in relation to some diseases. There are geographic and racial differences in their frequencies, but the frequency of secretor status in different ABO blood group systems has not been determined yet. Therefore, the aim of this study was mainly to determine this point. Blood and saliva from 762 randomly selected apparently healthy adult individuals (480 men and 282 women) were examined to determine their ABO and Rhesus blood groups by standard conventional methods, and their secretor status by using Lewis blood grouping and/or hemagglutination inhibition test of saliva. Results showed that 76.1% of the study population were ABH blood group antigens secretors and 23.9% were nonsecretors. The frequencies of secretor status in different ABO blood groups were 70.1% in group A, 67.8% in group B, 67.9% in group AB, and 88.3% in group O. In conclusion, blood group O individuals have significantly higher frequency of secretor status than non-O blood group individuals. This finding would be beneficial to them, protecting them, at least partially, from certain malignancies or allowing them to have less aggressive disease, and this finding might be useful in enhancing further studies and research in this direction.
CYP2D6 genotype and debrisoquine metabolic ratio (MR) were analyzed in 133 Nicaraguan Mestizos (NMs) and 260 Cubans divided into Cuban Mestizos (CMs) and White Cubans (WCs). The frequencies of poor metabolizers (MR12.6) were 6% in NMs, 3.9% in CMs and 5.3% in WCs. The frequencies of ultrarapid metabolizers (MR0.1) were 0% in NMs, 2.3% in CMs and 5.3% in WCs. Mean (±s.d.) MR among extensive metabolizers (MR<12.6) was higher in NMs (1.5±1.6; n=118) than in CMs (1.0±1.3; n=124; P<0.001) and WCs (0.7±1.0; n=124; P<0.001). MR correlated with the 'activity score' of CYP2D6 genotypes (P<0.05; r=-0.55). Mean MR was higher among NMs than WCs and CMs for groups classified as 1 (P<0.05) or 2 (P<0.01) 'activity score'. In addition, mean (±s.d.) MR was higher among subjects carrying CYP2D6*17 than in CYP2D6 wt/wt (P<0.001). The CYP2D6*10 allele was higher in NMs (3.1%) than in CMs (0.8%; P<0.05) and WCs (0.4%; P<0.05). CYP2D6*17 allele was higher in CMs (10.2%) than WC (2.7%; P<0.005) and NMs (0%). Thus, the variability in CYP2D6 phenotypes found may be related to differences in allele frequency among groups (that is, CYP2D6*10 and *17 highest in NMs and CMs, respectively). However, the influence of environmental factors or alleles different than those studied here cannot be ruled out.
ACE is a candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and associations have been reported between ACE variants and plasma ACE levels, AD risk, AD age at onset of disease and cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ. Despite evidence that ACE can degrade Aβ, the relationships between ACE variants and the levels of different types of Aβ in the brain are not known. We have investigated the relationship between AD-associated ACE variants, for which the associations with brain activity of ACE were previously analysed, and brain homogenate levels of soluble, insoluble and oligomeric Aβ. Reported AD risk variants in the ACE indel (rs1799752) and its 'proxy' rs4343 were significantly associated with soluble Aβ level in AD only (p=0.001), as was rs1800764 but less so (p=0.014). In contrast, insoluble Aβ was associated with ACE indel and rs4343 variants in controls only (p < 0.01). No associations were found for oligomeric Aβ. These data indicate a complex relationship between ACE and Aβ that differs between AD and control brains.
CYP2C19 is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of several clinically important drugs. The variations in the CYP2C19 promoter region may alter the transcription of the gene by altering the interaction between the trans and cis-acting elements. In the present study, CYP2C19 promoter region with different variant alleles were cloned into a pGL-3 basic luciferase reporter vector and transfected into HepG2 cell lines. Subsequently, dual luciferase activity was measured to evaluate the activity of the promoter region. Gel shift assays with predicted binding sites for CCAAT displacement protein, activating transcription factor-2 and glucocorticoid receptor were performed. Results from this study indicate that few variations present in the putative cis-acting elements of the CYP2C19 promoter region such as -1442T>C, -779A>C and -98T>C -1498T>G and -828del>T alter the transcription of the gene. Specific binding with nuclear proteins was also observed in gel shift assays. This may account for the interindividual variations in gene expression and genotype dependant differences in gene transcription. The results also suggest the role of activating transcription factor-2 and CCAAT displacement repressor protein on CYP2C19 gene transcription.
LPO activity in the liver and lungs of Wistar rats during the development of granulomatous inflammation caused by intravenous injection of SiO(2)microparticles was evaluated by the content of conjugated dienes, ketodienes, conjugated trienes, and products of interaction of LPO intermediates with TBA. In the lungs, changes in LPO activity manifested in increased content of ketodienes and conjugated trienes (by 1.6 and 1.5 times on days 3 and 14 after injection of SiO(2)microparticles, respectively) and conjugated dienes (by 1.2 times on day 21) compared to the control levels, but the content of TBA-reactive substances remained within the normal range. In the liver, the content of conjugated dienes increased by 1.6 times and that of ketodienes and conjugated trienes by 2.3 times; the content of TBA-reactive substances increased by 1.7 times compared to the control. The content of TBA-reactive substances in the liver gradually increased and by day 14 this parameter surpassed the control level by 3.9 times, but on day 21 it returned to normal. Thus, LPO processes in the liver after injection of SiO(2)microparticles were more intensive than in the lungs and their activity underwent phasic changes.
WWOX is a tumour suppressor gene altered in various human neoplasms. Deletion of WWOX is associated with bone metabolic defects and development of osteosarcoma in mice. We hypothesized that alterations of this gene are associated with the development of benign and malignant mesenchymal bone related lesions of the jaws. We investigated WWOX mRNA by nested reverse transcription-PCR and direct sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR in two osteosarcoma, two fibrosarcoma, eight ossifying fibroma and two fibrous dysplasia fresh samples. Malignancy was associated with a decreased WWOX mRNA expression. Aberrant transcription pattern was found in five samples; however, the relative quantification (RQ) of the WWOX mRNA in such lesions was not different from those carrying only the wild-type. We provide new evidence of WWOX alterations in osteosarcomas and demonstrate for the first time alterations of this gene in fibrosarcomas as well as in ossifying fibromas of the jaws.
ABCC11 is an ATP-binding cassette transporter responsible for the transport of a diverse range of lipophilic compounds. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) encoding an amino acid change has recently been shown to determine whether cerumen (earwax) is wet or dry. We hypothesised that this ABCC11 SNP may be associated with breast cancer risk because an association has been reported between wet earwax and increased risk of breast cancer. We therefore analysed the frequency of the functional SNP in 1342 cases and 2256 controls from two breast cancer studies of Caucasian women but found no evidence for an association with breast cancer risk.
CYP19A1 encodes aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens, and may play a role in variation in outcomes among men and women with cardiovascular disease. We sought to examine genetic variation in CYP19A1 for its potential role in sex differences in cardiovascular disease outcomes.
SLC19A3 (solute carrier family 19, member 3) is a thiamin transporter with 12 transmembrane domains. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in SLC19A3 cause two distinct clinical phenotypes, biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease and Wernicke's-like encephalopathy. Biotin and/or thiamin are effective therapies for both diseases.
RRM1 may be a prognostic factor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study is to evaluate RRM1 expression and prognosis in NSCLC by the means of tissue microarray.
SLCO1B1 gene variants are associated with severe statin-induced myopathy. We examined whether these variants are also associated with general statin intolerance in a large population of patients with type 2 diabetes receiving statins as part of routine clinical care. A total of 4,196 individuals were genotyped for rs4149056 (Val174Ala) and rs2306283 (Asp130Asn). Intolerance was defined by serum biochemistry and also by discontinuation, switching, or reduction in dose of the prescribed statin drug. Ala174 was associated with higher intolerance (odds ratio = 2.05, P = 0.043), whereas Asp130 was associated with lower intolerance (odds ratio = 0.71, P = 0.026). Ala174 was associated with a lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) response to statins (P = 0.01) whereas 130D was associated with a greater LDLc response to statins (P = 0.048), as previously reported; however, this association was no longer present when data for statin-intolerant individuals were removed from the analysis. This study suggests that common genetic variants selected for an extreme phenotype of statin-induced myopathy also predispose to more common milder statin intolerance and may, for this reason, impact lipid-lowering efficacy.
CYP2C9 metabolizes more than 100 clinically used drugs including phenytoin, S-warfarin, tolbutamide, glipizide, diclofenac, and losartan with varying contributions. CYP2C9 is considered one of the most important CYPs, with substrate specificity typical of many new chemical entities (i.e. lipophilic bases). A large interindividual variation has been identified for the CYP2C9 activity and for the clinical response to the therapeutics metabolised by the enzyme. So far, at least 33 variants of CYP2C9 (*2 through to *34) have been identified. CYP2C9 is one of the clinically significant drug metabolising enzymes that demonstrates genetic variants with significant phenotype and clinical outcomes. This review updates our current knowledge on the polymorphic metabolism of drugs by CYP2C9 and discusses its implications in drug development. The authors have searched through computer-based literatures by full text search in Medline (via Pubmed), ScienceDirect, Genetics Abstracts (CSA), SCOPUS, Chemical Abstracts, Current Contents Connect (ISI), Cochrance Library, CINAHL (EBSCO), CrossRef Search and Embase (all from inception to October 31 2010). A comprehensive literature search has identified 32 drugs that are subject to CYP2C9-mediated polymorphic metabolism. Drugs that are subject to polymorphic metabolism with clinical significance include nine nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, six sulfonylurea antidiabetic drugs and, most critically, three oral coumarin anticoagulants. Polymorphisms in CYP2C9 have the potential to affect the clearance and clinical response of CYP2C9 substrate drugs with low therapeutic indices such as warfarin, phenytoin, and certain antidiabetic drugs. Warfarin has served as a model drug of how pharmacogenetics can be employed to achieve maximum efficacy and minimum toxicity. Minimizing interindividual variability in drug exposure due to CYP2C9 polymorphisms is an important goal in drug development and discovery.
ABO incompatible liver transplantation is still controversial, but accepted in selected cases. Recently several authors reported use of the new technology aimed at elimination anti-donor ABO specific hemagglutinins to assist immunosuppression in preventing acute rejection after transplantation.
SLC2A9 gene variants associate with serum uric acid in white populations, but little is known about African American populations. Since SLC2A9 is a transporter, gene variants may be expected to associate more closely with the fractional excretion of urate, a measure of renal tubular transport, than with serum uric acid, which is influenced by production and extrarenal clearance.
CYP11A1 is a key enzyme in steroid synthesis abundantly expressed in the adrenal, testis, ovary, and placenta. This article reviews recent studies on cis-regulatory elements and trans-regulators of the CYP11A1 promoter, with special focus on their tissue-specific regulation. Trans-regulators include tissue-specific factors such as SF-1, DAX-1, TReP-132, LBP, and GATA that regulate tissue-specific expression of CYP11A1. These tissue-specific factors interact with factors commonly present in most cells like AP-1, Sp1, and AP-2 to bring CYP11A1 transcription to full potential. These transcription factors stimulate CYP11A1 transcriptional activity through interaction with their specific cis-elements or through protein-protein interaction. The cis-element on the Cyp11a1 promoter was further characterized in vitro and in vivo. Mutation of the proximal SF-1-binding site results in down regulation of CYP11A1 in the adrenal and testis but not in the ovary and placenta, leading to attenuated corticosterone circadian rhythms and blunted stress response.
ESD (esterase D), GLO1 (glyoxalase I), and GPT (glutamate pyruvate transaminase) are human erythrocytic isoenzymes and have previously been applied in forensic medicine caseworks. The molecular bases of the polymorphic gene expression products have been demonstrated to be because of SNPs in respective coding regions. However, it has not been revealed whether the SNPs conferring the polymorphisms to the aforementioned erythrocytic isoenzymes could be simultaneously detected by using a simple PCR method. In this study, we used mismatched primers to simultaneously amplify three common isoenzyme loci so that all amplified products contained the same Hph I cleavage sites. The products were then digested with Hph I and electrophoretically separated and stained so that alleles were identified. The accumulated values for the probability of discrimination power and excluding the probability of paternity to the aforementioned systems attained 90.41% and 41.72%, respectively, in the Chinese Han population. This assay could be extremely valuable for future forensic medicine practices.
ABO genotyping is often performed to identify the blood type of decomposed samples, which is difficult to be determined by a serological test. In this study, we developed a simple method for ABO genotyping using a DNA chip. In this method, polymerase chain reaction-amplified and fluorescent-labeled fragments in the ABO gene and primate-specific D17Z1 were hybridized with DNA probes on a chip designed to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ABO gene and part of the D17Z1 sequence. Using blood samples from 42 volunteers and 10 animal species, we investigated whether the chip could be used to detect SNPs in the ABO gene and the D17Z1 sequence. This method was then applied to various forensic samples, and it was confirmed that this method was suitable for the simultaneous analyses of ABO genotyping and species identification. This method fulfills the recent need for the development of rapid and convenient methods for criminal investigations.
CYP3A4 is a major member of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes which play crucial roles in cardiovascular diseases. Recently, a novel polymorphism in the CYP3A4 gene, IVS10+12G>A, named CYP3A4*1G (rs2242480), has been identified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential relationship between the CYP3A4*1G allele and the susceptibility of coronary heart disease (CHD). A total of 628 individuals (322 unrelated patients with CHD and 306 age- and sex-matched healthy controls) were investigated in the study. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to identify CYP3A4*1G. We also analysed the functional significance of IVS10+12G>A using the dual-luciferase reporter assay. The results showed that the frequency of the CYP3A4*1G allele was 0.290 and the CYP3A4*1G/*1G genotype was 0.090 in the patients with CHD. The patients with the CYP3A4*1G/*1G genotype had higher CHD risk, with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.84 (p=0.025; 95% CI=1.32-12.65) after adjustment for conventional risk factors. A gender-dependent difference was also observed. The CYP3A4*1G/*1G frequency was significantly higher in female patients than in the controls (p=0.034, OR=3.02, 95% CI=1.04-8.70). Furthermore, the dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that the A allele at IVS10+12G>A had a significantly higher transcriptional activity than the G allele. Our results imply that CYP3A4*1G contributes to the susceptibility of CHD in the Chinese Han population, which may be useful for the study of specific molecular pathogenesis for CHD.
CA1 pyramidal neurons are the final integrators of information flow leaving the hippocampus, yet are singularly vulnerable to activity-dependent cell death. Zinc (Zn) entry into cells may add to this vulnerability. Here, we find that Slc39a1 and Slc39a3, members of the Zip (Zrt/Irt-like protein) plasmalemmal Zn transporter family, are predominantly expressed in the hippocampus. We examined Zip-1,3-deficient mice to investigate their role in neurodegeneration following intense synaptic activation. When isolated by blockade of NMDA receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels, the absence of both transporters slowed passive Zn uptake into CA1 neurons measured with intracellular fluorescent Zn dyes. In vivo CA1 cell damage following kainic acid exposure was greatly attenuated. Consistent with the hypothesis that Zn entry contributes to neurodegeneration, Znt-3-deficient mice lacking synaptic Zn also show less hippocampal cell damage following kainic acid injection. Zip transporters may provide selective therapeutic targets to protect these neurons from early Zn-induced neurodegeneration following injury.
ABCA3 transporter (ATP-binding cassette transporter of the A subfamily) is localized to the limiting membrane of lamellar bodies, organelles for assembly and storage of pulmonary surfactant in alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII). It transports surfactant phospholipids into lamellar bodies and absence of ABCA3 function disrupts lamellar body biogenesis. Mutations of the ABCA3 gene lead to fatal neonatal surfactant deficiency and chronic interstitial lung disease (ILD) of children. ABCA3 mutations can result in either functional defects of the correctly localized ABCA3 or trafficking/folding defects where mutated ABCA3 remains in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
PAH removal with surfactant enhanced washing was investigated through a series of laboratory tests to examine the effect of stirring speed, washing time, surfactant concentration, liquid/solid ratio, temperature, and on-and-off mode. The first four factors show significant influence on the PAH removal while the latter two do not. Total removal ratio and a new proposed parameter, solubilization percentage, are used to evaluate the effectiveness quantitatively.
FH is a hereditary inherited disorder of cholesterol metabolism. Homozygous form of the disease associates severe form of atherosclerotic disease. Clinicians have been tried to inhibit the progression of the homozygous FH with medical and surgical treatment. We here present three siblings with homozygous FH who were successfully treated with liver transplantation.
PTEN is a frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene that opposes the PI3K/AKT pathway through dephosphorylation of phosphoinositide-3,4,5-triphosphate. Recently, nuclear compartmentalization of PTEN was found as a key component of its tumor-suppressive activity; however its nuclear function remains poorly defined. Here we show that nuclear PTEN interacts with APC/C, promotes APC/C association with CDH1, and thereby enhances the tumor-suppressive activity of the APC-CDH1 complex. We find that nuclear exclusion but not phosphatase inactivation of PTEN impairs APC-CDH1. This nuclear function of PTEN provides a straightforward mechanistic explanation for the fail-safe cellular senescence response elicited by acute PTEN loss and the tumor-suppressive activity of catalytically inactive PTEN. Importantly, we demonstrate that PTEN mutant and PTEN null states are not synonymous as they are differentially sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of APC-CDH1 targets such as PLK1 and Aurora kinases. This finding identifies a strategy for cancer patient stratification and, thus, optimization of targeted therapies. PAPERCLIP:
OCRL mutations, which are a hallmark of Lowe syndrome, have recently been found in patients with isolated renal phenotype (Dent-2 disease). In this report, we describe clinical and laboratory features in five Macedonian children with mutations in the OCRL gene. Children with a clinical diagnosis of Lowe syndrome or Dent disease underwent complete neurological and ophthalmological examination, imaging of the kidney and urinary tract, assessment of renal tubular function, and mutation analysis of the OCRL gene. Two children (18 months and 11 years, respectively) were diagnosed with Lowe syndrome on the basis of congenital cataracts, severe psychomotor retardation, and renal dysfunction. Both children had low molecular weight proteinuria (LMWP) and hypercalciuria, but not Fanconi syndrome. The older one had bilateral nephrolithiasis due to associated hypocitraturia and mild hyperoxaluria. Three children with asymptomatic proteinuria were diagnosed with Dent-2 disease; none had cataracts or neurological deficit. One child showed mild mental retardation. All had LMWP, hypercalciuria, and elevated enzymes (creatine phosphokinase, lactic dehydrogenase). All three children had an abnormal Tc-99m DMSA scan revealing poor visualization of the kidneys with a high radionuclide content in the bladder; none had nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. In conclusion, children with OCRL mutations may present with very mild phenotype (asymptomatic proteinuria with/without mild mental retardation) or severe classic oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe. Elevated enzymes and abnormal results on the Tc-99m DMSA scan may be useful indicators for Dent-2 disease.
CD36 is a class B scavenger receptor observed in many cell types and tissues throughout the body. Recent literature has implicated CD36 in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysregulation such as found in obesity, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis. Genetic variation at the CD36 loci have been associated with obesity and lipid components of the metabolic syndrome, with risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Recently, non-cell bound CD36 was identified in human plasma and was termed soluble CD36 (sCD36). In this review we will describe the functions of CD36 in tissues and address the role of sCD36 in the context of the metabolic syndrome. We will also highlight recent findings from human genetic studies looking at the CD36 locus in relation to metabolic profile in the general population. Finally, we present a model in which insulin resistance, oxLDL, low-grade inflammation and liver steatosis may contribute to elevated levels of sCD36.
IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur frequently in gliomas and acute myeloid leukemia, leading to simultaneous loss and gain of activities in the production of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), respectively. Here we demonstrate that 2-HG is a competitive inhibitor of multiple α-KG-dependent dioxygenases, including histone demethylases and the TET family of 5-methlycytosine (5mC) hydroxylases. 2-HG occupies the same space as α-KG does in the active site of histone demethylases. Ectopic expression of tumor-derived IDH1 and IDH2 mutants inhibits histone demethylation and 5mC hydroxylation. In glioma, IDH1 mutations are associated with increased histone methylation and decreased 5-hydroxylmethylcytosine (5hmC). Hence, tumor-derived IDH1 and IDH2 mutations reduce α-KG and accumulate an α-KG antagonist, 2-HG, leading to genome-wide histone and DNA methylation alterations.
NQO1 gene polymorphism at nucleotide 609 (Pro187Ser) results in a lowering of NQO1 detoxifying activity and is associated with susceptibility to various cancers. The NQO1 genotypes were identified by RFLP in 104 bladder cancer cases and 120 control subjects in an ethnic Kashmiri population. The frequency of the variant NQO1 alleles (CT/TT) was 23.3% for controls and 32.2% for cases (P < 0.05). Overall, the variant alleles were associated with a higher risk of bladder cancer in cases than in the control group (OR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.17-3.04; P < 0.01). In addition, the variant allele genotypes (CT/TT) were associated with a risk of bladder cancer that was more than threefold higher in smokers (OR = 3.47; 95% CI 1.84-6.3; P < 0.001). Results of this study strongly suggest that the variant allele of NQO1 (Pro187Ser) may affect individual susceptibility to bladder cancer, particularly among smokers, in this ethnic Kashmiri population.
ABO allo-immunization is the most frequent hemolytic disease of the newborn and ABO incompatibility is present in 15-25 % of pregnancies. True ABO alloimmunization occurs in approximately one out of 150 births. Intensity is generally lower than in RhD allo-immunization. We report on three cases showing that ABO allo-immunization can lead to severe hemolytic disease of the newborn with potentially threatening hyperbilirubinemia and complications. Early diagnosis and adequate care are necessary to prevent complications in ABO incompatibility. A direct antiglobulin test is the cornerstone of diagnosis and should be performed at birth on cord blood sampling in all group infants born to O mothers, especially if of African origin. Risk factor analysis and attentive clinical monitoring during the first days of life are essential. Vigilance is even more important for infants discharged before the age of 72 h. Every newborn should be assessed for the risk of developing severe hyperbilirubinemia and should be examined by a qualified healthcare professional in the first days of life. Treatment depends on the total serum bilirubin level, which may increase very rapidly in the first 48 h of life in cases of hemolytic disease of the newborn. Phototherapy and, in severe cases, exchange transfusion are used to prevent hyperbilirubinemia encephalopathy. Intravenous immunoglobulins are used to reduce exchange transfusion. Treatments of severe hemolytic disease of the newborn should be provided and performed by trained personnel in neonatal intensive care units.
SOD2 is a key mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme and its perturbation leads to oxidative cell death, which results in various disorders. In this study, we identified a deubiquitinating enzyme USP36 that regulates the protein stability of SOD2. The regulatory effect of USP36 on SOD2 was initially identified by 2-DE and MALDI-TOF/MS analyses. In addition, endogenous USP36 and SOD2 were shown to interact in an immunoprecipitation assay, which was verified using the yeast two-hybrid system. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SOD2 binds with ubiquitin molecules to form polyubiquitination chains and undergoes degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Finally, USP36 was shown to be a specific deubiquitinating enzyme that reduces the ubiquitination level of SOD2 and was involved in SOD2 protein stability by extending its half-life.
CD36 is a widely expressed cell surface receptor that binds lipoproteins, and its function has been implicated in many complications of the metabolic syndrome. A cell-free form of CD36, soluble CD36 (sCD36), has been reported in human plasma, found to be elevated in obesity and diabetes, and claimed as a marker of insulin resistance.
ABCD2 score identifies high-risk TIAs but its validity in different countries and hospitals is unknown. Doubts remain also about the role of diagnostic work up for patients with TIAs in the emergency department. The present study was undertaken to confirm the usefulness of ABCD2 score in the emergency department of Trento Hospital and to evaluate if other exams (carotid ultrasound or CT scan) commonly performed in TIA patients are helpful. We retrospectively analysed discharge diagnosis of around 120,000 patients seen at the first aid of Trento Hospital over a 28 month period. ABCD2 score, carotid ultrasound and CT scan were recorded and were correlated with recurrence of stroke at different time points (mean follow-up period of 11.4 months) in all patients with TIA. We identified 965 patients with focal neurologic deficit and 502 could be classified as TIA. An ischemic stroke recurred in 30 patients at the end of the follow-up (30% in the first two days). ABCD2 score confirmed its value. A significant carotid stenosis (>70%) was an independent risk factor for stroke at any time point. Our study confirms the role of ABCD2 in a large Italian cohort of TIA patients but also suggests the importance of performing a carotid ultrasound as soon as possible.
GCK gene analysis in an Italian MODY patient revealed a novel synonymous substitution in exon 4 (c.459T>G; p.Pro153Pro) resulting in an aberrant transcript lacking the last eight codons of the same exon. Our findings emphazise the importance of not underestimating synonymous variations when screening for disease-causing mutations.
G6PC3 (or glucose-6-phosphatase-β) deficiency underlies a congenital neutropenia syndrome in which neutrophils exhibit enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, increased apoptosis, impaired energy homeostasis, and impaired functionality. Here we show that murine G6pc3(-/-) neutrophils undergoing ER stress activate protein kinase-like ER kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate/Akt signaling pathways, and that neutrophil apoptosis is mediated in part by the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. In G6PC3-deficient patients, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) improves neutropenia, but its impact on neutrophil apoptosis and dysfunction is unknown. We now show that G-CSF delays neutrophil apoptosis in vitro by modulating apoptotic mediators. However, G6pc3(-/-) neutrophils in culture exhibit accelerated apoptosis compared with wild-type neutrophils both in the presence or absence of G-CSF. Limiting glucose (0.6mM) accelerates apoptosis but is more pronounced for wild-type neutrophils, leading to similar survival profiles for both neutrophil populations. In vivo G-CSF therapy completely corrects neutropenia and normalizes levels of p-Akt, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, and active caspase-3. Neutrophils from in vivo G-CSF-treated G6pc3(-/-) mice exhibit increased glucose uptake and elevated intracellular levels of G6P, lactate, and adenosine-5'-triphosphate, leading to improved functionality. Together, the results strongly suggest that G-CSF improves G6pc3(-/-) neutrophil survival by modulating apoptotic mediators and rectifies function by enhancing energy homeostasis.
CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) has been shown to form multiple protein macromolecular complexes with its interacting partners at discrete subcellular microdomains to modulate trafficking, transport and signalling in cells. Targeting protein-protein interactions within these macromolecular complexes would affect the expression or function of the CFTR channel. We specifically targeted the PDZ domain-based LPA2 (type 2 lysophosphatidic acid receptor)-NHERF2 (Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-2) interaction within the CFTR-NHERF2-LPA2-containing macromolecular complexes in airway epithelia and tested its regulatory role on CFTR channel function. We identified a cell-permeable small-molecule compound that preferentially inhibits the LPA2-NHERF2 interaction. We show that this compound can disrupt the LPA2-NHERF2 interaction in cells and thus compromises the integrity of macromolecular complexes. Functionally, it elevates cAMP levels in proximity to CFTR and upregulates its channel activity. The results of the present study demonstrate that CFTR Cl- channel function can be finely tuned by modulating PDZ domain-based protein-protein interactions within the CFTR-containing macromolecular complexes. The present study might help to identify novel therapeutic targets to treat diseases associated with dysfunctional CFTR Cl- channels.
PIK3CA and PAK1 are critical genes in the PI3K/AKT/PAK pathway. Amplification and strong expression of PIK3CA and PAK1 were identified in around 50% and 88% oral carcinomas, respectively, while co-expression of PIK3CA and PAK1 together was found to be present in 80% of oral carcinomas. PIK3CA and PAK1 amplification was more obvious in recurrent tumors than their primary counterparts. Low grade amplification of PAK1 was prevalent in tumor risk individuals. Knockdown of expression of PIK3CA and PAK1 reduced the oncogenic potential of tumor cells. This study is the first to demonstrate the concordant PIK3CA and PAK1 alterations in oral carcinoma.
"CLC anion transport proteins function as Cl (-) channels and Cl (-) /H (+) exchangers and are found in all major groups of life including archaebacteria. Early electrophysiological studies suggested that CLC anion channels have two pores that are opened and closed independently by a ""fast"" gating process operating on a millisecond timescale, and a ""common"" or ""slow"" gate that opens and closes both pores simultaneously with a timescale of seconds (Figure 1A). Subsequent biochemical and molecular experiments suggested that CLC channels/transporters are homodomeric proteins ( 1-3) ."
CP bar is an uncommon but important cause of dysphagia in elderly people. A CP bar is often undetected during upper endoscopy and might be missed with barium radiography if adequate attention is not focused on the hypopharynx. In suspected cases, evaluation for alternative etiologies of dysphagia is important because the CP bar might be an incidental finding. Secondary causes of CP dysfunction resulting from underlying primary myopathic or neuropathic disorders should be considered before therapy. The effectiveness of dilation and surgical myotomy in alleviating dysphagia associated with CP bars has been reported in small series.
CYP2C19 is a highly polymorphic enzyme that affects the metabolism of a wide range of therapeutic drugs. Almost all the identified alleles of CYP2C19 are derived from nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs). The objective of this study was to functionally characterize 20 nsSNPs of CYP2C19, distributed throughout the entire coding region, most of which have not been thoroughly characterized. cDNAs of these variants were constructed and expressed in yeast cells. All variants had similar levels of apoprotein and holoprotein expression, except for CYP2C19.16 and D360N, which had significantly lower holoprotein levels than the wild-type (WT) CYP2C19 enzyme, and CYP2C19.5B, which showed only apoprotein. The activity of the CYP2C19 variants was investigated using two substrates, S-mephenytoin and omeprazole, and six different kinetic parameters were measured. CYP2C19.5B, CYP2C19.6, and CYP2C19.8 were found to be catalytically inactive. The entire dataset of the remaining 17 variants, together with the WT, was analyzed by multivariate analysis. This analysis indicated that CYP2C19.9, CYP2C19.10, CYP2C19.16, CYP2C19.18, CYP2C19.19, A161P, W212C, and D360N were substantially altered in catalytic properties in comparison with the WT, with each of these variants exhibiting either dramatically decreased catalytic activities or higher K(m) values. These results not only generally confirmed the function of previously reported variants but also identified additional reduced-function variants. These findings will greatly extend our understanding of CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms in humans as well as facilitate the structure-function study of the CYP2C19 protein.
WWOX gene is altered in a variety of neoplasms. Wwox is pro-apoptotic through interaction with p73 and may be involved in chromosomal stability by interaction with p73 and p53. The aims of this study were to characterize WWOX transcription, methylation status and immunoexpression in salivary neoplasms and to determine whether these were associated with p73, p53, cell proliferation and DNA ploidy.
PTEN is inactivated in a subset of lung cancer; therefore, we investigated the involvement of PTEN inactivation in invasiveness of lung cancer cells. AKT at Ser473 was phosphorylated in several lung cancer cell lines with loss of PTEN expression. Therefore, we created a tetracycline inducible expression system of wild-type PTEN (PTEN-WT) as well as catalytically (PTEN-G129R) and lipid phosphatase (PTEN-G129E) inactive PTEN mutants using the PC14, PC9 and PC3 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, in which endogenous PTEN expression was not detected and AKT at Ser473 was phosphorylated by Western blot analysis. Induction of PTEN-WT reduced phosphorylation of AKT and inhibited the transcriptional activity of NFkB, whereas PTEN mutants did not, suggesting that PTEN inactivation results in the activation of the AKT/NFkB pathway in PC14, PC9 and PC3 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of PTEN-WT suppressed anchorage independent growth in soft agar and reduced invasiveness in a trans-well chamber assay of PC14 cells. Neither PTEN-G129R nor PTEN-G129E had suppressive effects on anchorage independent growth and invasiveness. Augmentation of invasiveness by constitutively active AKT was also shown in mouse NIH3T3 cells. Therefore, it was strongly indicated that activation of the PI3K/AKT/NFkB pathway by PTEN inactivation results in augmented invasiveness in lung cancer cells and lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN plays a key role in this process.
PTEN Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome (PHTS) includes Cowden syndrome (CS), Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), and other conditions resulting from germline mutation of the PTEN tumour suppressor gene. Although macrocephaly, presumably due to megencephaly, is found in both CS and BRRS, the prevalence and degree have not been formally assessed in PHTS. We evaluated head size in a prospective nested series of 181 patients found to have pathogenic germline PTEN mutations. Clinical data including occipital-frontal circumference (OFC) measurement were requested for all participants. Macrocephaly was present in 94% of 161 evaluable PHTS individuals. In patients ≤ 18 years, mean OFC was +4.89 standard deviations (SD) above the population mean with no difference between genders (P = 0.7). Among patients >18 years, average OFC was 60.0 cm in females and 62.8 cm in males (P < 0.0001). To systematically determine whether macrocephaly was due to megencephaly, we examined Pten(M3M4) missense mutant mice generated and maintained on mixed backgrounds. Mice were killed at various ages, brains were dissected out and weighed. Average brain weight for Pten(M3M4) homozygous mice (N = 15) was 1.02 g compared with 0.57 g for heterozygous mice (N = 29) and 0.49 g for wild-type littermates (N = 24) (P < 0.0001). Macrocephaly, secondary to megencephaly, is an important component of PHTS and more prevalent than previously appreciated. Patients with PHTS have increased risks for breast and thyroid cancers, and early diagnosis is key to initiating timely screening to reduce patient morbidity and mortality. Clinicians should consider germline PTEN testing at an early point in the diagnostic work-up for patients with extreme macrocephaly.
ACSL3 is a member of the long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) family that consists of 5 isozymes responsible for cellular fatty acid metabolism in various tissues in an isozyme-specific manner. Our previous studies have demonstrated that expression of ACSL3 mRNA and protein in liver was specifically increased after feeding hamsters with a fat- and cholesterol-enriched diet, providing the first in vivo evidence for the regulated expression of ACSL3 in liver tissue. The aim of the current study was to further investigate the role of ACSL3 in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism in vitro and in vivo. We utilized an adenoviral-mediated gene delivery approach to exogenously express hamster ACSL3 in hamster liver as well as in HepG2 cells. Transduction of HepG2 cells with Ad-hamACSL3 adenovirus elevated total cellular ACSL enzyme activity, which was accompanied by a significant reduction of cellular contents of triglycerides and total phospholipids. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy studies revealed that ACSL3 was localized to endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. In vivo, infection of hamsters with Ad-hamACSL3 led to sustained expression of ACSL3 mRNA and protein in liver two weeks after infection. Importantly, compared with Ad-GFP control virus infected hamsters, we observed significantly lower free fatty acids and triglycerides plus modest reduction of phospholipids in the serum of Ad-hamACSL3 infected animals. Furthermore, triglyceride levels were significantly reduced in Ad-hamACSL3 infected hamster liver. Altogether, these results provide important and physiologically relevant evidence that strengthens the link between ACSL3 expression and hepatic reduction of triglycerides and fatty acids.
NNMT (nicotinamide N-methyltransferase, E.C. 2.1.1.1) catalyses the N-methylation of nicotinamide to 1-methylnicotinamide. NNMT expression is significantly elevated in a number of cancers, and we have previously demonstrated that NNMT expression is significantly increased in the brains of patients who have died of Parkinson's disease. To investigate the cellular effects of NNMT overexpression, we overexpressed NNMT in the SH-SY5Y cell line, a tumour-derived human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell line with no endogenous expression of NNMT. NNMT expression significantly decreased SH-SY5Y cell death, which correlated with increased intracellular ATP content, ATP/ADP ratio and Complex I activity, and a reduction in the degradation of the NDUFS3 [NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron-sulfur protein 3] subunit of Complex I. These effects were replicated by incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with 1-methylnicotinamide, suggesting that 1-methylnicotinamide mediates the cellular effects of NNMT. Both NNMT expression and 1-methylnicotinamide protected SH-SY5Y cells from the toxicity of the Complex I inhibitors MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion) and rotenone by reversing their effects upon ATP synthesis, the ATP/ADP ratio, Complex I activity and the NDUFS3 subunit. The results of the present study raise the possibility that the increase in NNMT expression that we observed in vivo may be a stress response of the cell to the underlying pathogenic process. Furthermore, the results of the present study also raise the possibility of using inhibitors of NNMT for the treatment of cancer.
CD36 is a multifunctional protein homologous to the class B scavenger receptor SR-B1 mainly found in tissues with a sustained lipid metabolism and in several hematopoieic cells. CD36 is thought to be involved in various physiological and pathological processes like angiogenesis, thrombosis, atherogenesis, Alzheimer's disease or malaria. An additive emerging function for CD36 is a role as a lipid sensor. Location of CD36 and orthologue molecules in plasma membrane of cells in contact with the external environment (e.g. gustatory, intestinal or olfactory epithelia) allows the binding of exogenous-derived ligands including dietary lipids, diglycerides from bacterial wall in mammals and even a lipid-like pheromone in insects. Similar function might also exist in the brain in which a CD36-dependent sensing of fatty acids has been reported in ventromedial hypothalamic neurons in rodents. Specific recognition of lipid-related molecules by a receptor-like protein highly conserved throughout the evolution strongly suggests that lipid-sensing by CD36 is responsible for basic physiological functions in relation with behavior, energy balance and innate immunity.
CYP2C19 is a principal enzyme involved in the bioactivation of the antiplatelet prodrug clopidogrel and common CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles are associated with adverse cardiovascular events. To assess the impact of the CYP2C19*17 increased activity allele in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) and Sephardi Jewish (SJ) populations and to determine the frequencies of additional variant alleles, 250 AJ and 135 SJ individuals were genotyped for CYP2C19*2-*10, *12-*17, *22 and P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) c.3435C>T. Importantly, CYP2C19*4, a loss-of-function allele, was identified in linkage disequilibrium with *17. This novel haplotype, designated CYP2C19*4B, significantly alters the interpretation of CYP2C19 genotyping when testing *17. Moreover, genotyping CYP2C19*17 changed the frequency of extensive metabolizers from ∼70 to ∼40%, reclassifying ∼30% as ultrarapid metabolizers. Combining CYP2C19 and ABCB1 identified ∼1 in 3 AJ and ∼1 in 2 SJ individuals at increased risk for adverse responses to clopidogrel. These data underscore the importance of including *4B and *17 when clinically genotyping CYP2C19.
PLA2G6 was reported recently as the causative gene for PARK14-linked autosomal recessive early-onset dystonia-parkinsonism. In a recent study in Singapore, heterozygous PLA2G6 p.P806R (c.2417C>G) mutation in exon 17 was reported to be a possible Parkinson's disease (PD)-related mutation. To determine the significance of the PLA2G6 mutation, we conducted an association study by performing direct sequencing of PLA2G6 exon 17 in 379 Japanese sporadic PD patients and 310 controls in the Japanese general population. In this group, we found 12 patients (12/379=3.16%) and 10 controls (10/310=3.23%) with a heterozygous p.P806R mutation (P=0.96, χ(2)=0.0019). Therefore, our large case-controlled study suggests that PLA2G6 p.P806R is not a disease-associated polymorphism in PD. Moreover, we performed direct sequencing of all exons and exon-intron boundaries of PLA2G6 in 116 Japanese patients with sporadic PD. Two single heterozygous variants (p.R301C or p.D331N) were found (both frequencies: 1/379 patients vs 0/310 controls) and the roles of their variants were unclear. Finally, combined with the previous report, our findings emphasize that PLA2G6 mutations are unlikely to be the major causes or risk factors of PD at least in Asian populations. However, further large studies in various populations are needed because patients with PLA2G6 mutations can show heterogeneous clinical features.
MTMR2 is a member of the myotubularin family of inositol lipid phosphatases, a large protein-tyrosine phosphatase subgroup that is conserved from yeast to humans. Furthermore, the peripheral neuromuscular disease Charcot-Marie Tooth disease type 4B has been attributed to mutations in the mtmr2 gene. Because the molecular mechanisms regulating MTMR2 have been poorly defined, we investigated whether reversible phosphorylation might regulate MTMR2 function. We used mass spectrometry-based methods to identify a high stoichiometry phosphorylation site on serine 58 of MTMR2. Phosphorylation at Ser(58), or a phosphomimetic S58E mutation, markedly decreased MTMR2 localization to endocytic vesicular structures. In contrast, a phosphorylation-deficient MTMR2 mutant (S58A) displayed constitutive localization to early endocytic structures. This localization pattern was accompanied by displacement of a PI(3)P-specific sensor protein and an increase in signal transduction pathways. Thus, MTMR2 phosphorylation is likely to be a critical mechanism by which MTMR2 access to its lipid substrate(s) is temporally and spatially regulated, thereby contributing to the control of downstream endosome maturation events.
CD36 plays a critical role in the inhibition of angiogenesis through binding to the type 1 repeats of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and activating Fyn tyrosine kinase and MAPK pathways. Here, we reveal a novel association of CD36 with VEGFR-2 and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). We also address the correlation between the expression of CD36 and Syk by demonstrating that overexpression of CD36 in HUVECs up-regulates endogenous Syk expression. We also define a new role for TSP-1 and CD36 in the activation of the VEGFR-2 signaling pathway that requires Syk. Our findings also identify a role for Syk as a stimulator of VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis by increasing phosphorylation of Y1175 in VEGFR-2, which is a major tyrosine for promoting VEGF-A-induced endothelial cell migration. Together, these studies introduce a new signaling pathway for TSP-1, CD36, and Syk, and address the role of these proteins in regulating the angiogenic switch.
CYP2C19 variants have been demonstrated to play an important role in determining response to clopidogrel and outcomes while on clopidogrel therapy. Predicting patient response through pre-therapeutic genotyping may therefore guide selection of antiplatelet therapy.
PTEN phosphatase is a potent tumor suppressor that regulates multiple cellular functions. In the cytoplasm, PTEN dephosphorylates its primary lipid substrate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, to antagonize the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway. It has also become increasingly evident that PTEN functions in the nucleus and may play an important part in transcription regulation, but its nuclear targets remain elusive. In this report, we demonstrate the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a protein target of PTEN phosphatase and that PTEN deficiency leads to CREB phosphorylation independent of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Using confocal immunofluorescence and reciprocal immunoprecipitation, we further show that PTEN colocalizes with CREB and physically interacts with CREB. Moreover, we use both in vitro and in vivo experiments to show PTEN can dephosphorylate CREB in a phosphatase-dependent manner, suggesting that CREB is a substrate of PTEN nuclear phosphatase. Loss of Pten results in an elevated RNA level of multiple CREB transcriptional targets and increased cell proliferation, which can be reversed by a nonphosphorylatable CREB mutant or knockdown of CREB. These data reveal a mechanism for PTEN modulation of CREB-mediated gene transcription and cell growth. Our study thus characterizes PTEN as a nuclear phophatase of a transcription factor and identifies CREB as a novel protein target of PTEN phosphatase, which contributes to better understanding of PTEN function in the nucleus.
CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in multiple cell types, including pancreatic β cells. It can serve as an enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of two different Ca(2+)-mobilizing compounds, cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate. One of these metabolites, cADPR, is known to be involved in glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells. Although the essential role of CD38 for endogenous cADPR synthesis has been established, the relationship between the proposed extracellular enzymatic activity of CD38 and the intracellular Ca(2+) modulation caused by the intracellular cADPR accumulation has not yet been fully explained. For a better understanding of the role of CD38 in the insulin secretion machinery, analysis of the intracellular localization of this molecule in pancreatic β cells is essential. In an attempt to provide a method to probe the N-terminal and C-terminal of CD38 separately, we generated an insulin-secreting MIN6 murine pancreatic β cell line expressing a human CD38 bearing an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag. We found a weak but consistent expression of the FLAG epitope outside of the cells, indicating the presence of a small amount of CD38 with cytoplasmic enzymatic activity. MIN6 cells transfected with human CD38 exhibited increased glucose-induced insulin release. In addition, anti-FLAG cross-linking further enhanced the insulin release, suggesting that the N-terminal of CD38 expressed on the cell surface functions as a receptor for an unknown ligand and triggers positive signals for insulin secretion.
CYP3A5 genotyping might be useful to guide tacrolimus and sirolimus dosing. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of CYP3A5 polymorphism on everolimus metabolism and pharmacokinetics.
CNDP1 is located on 18q22.3, where linkage with diabetic nephropathy has been observed in several populations, including Pima Indians. However, evidence for association between CNDP1 alleles and diabetic nephropathy is equivocal and population-dependent. This study investigated CNDP1 as a candidate for diabetic kidney disease in Pima Indians. Nineteen tag single nucleotide polymorphisms spanning the CNDP1 locus were selected using genotype data from Chinese individuals in the HapMap resource along with 2 variants previously associated with diabetic nephropathy. All variants were genotyped in 3 different samples including a diabetic end-stage renal disease (ESRD) case-control study, a family-based study of diabetic individuals who participated in the linkage study for nephropathy, and a cohort of diabetic individuals in whom longitudinal measures of glomerular filtration rates (GFR) were performed. There was no statistically significant evidence for association with diabetic ESRD. However, nominal evidence for association was found in the family study, where markers rs12957330 (Odds ratio [OR]=0.29 per copy of G allele; p=0.04) and rs17817077 (OR=0.46 per copy of G allele; p=0.05) were associated with diabetic nephropathy. In addition, markers rs12964454, rs7244647, and rs7229005 were associated with changes in GFR (-8.5ml/min per copy of the G allele; p=0.04; 18.8ml/min per copy of the C allele; p=0.03; and -13.4ml/min per copy of the C allele; p=0.001, respectively). These findings provide nominal evidence supporting a role between CNDP1 variants and diabetic kidney disease.
PFKFB4 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4) is induced by hypoxia and is strongly associated with glycolysis. Previously, we reported that PFKFB4 expression level may serve as a predictor of progression in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Here, the role of PFKFB4 in NMIBC and the relationship between PFKFB4 expression and biological behavior in bladder cancer was investigated.
CYP3A4 expression in breast cancer correlates with decreased overall survival, but the mechanisms are unknown. Cytochrome P450 gene profiling by RNAi silencing demonstrates that CYP3A or 2C8 gene expression is specifically required for growth of the breast cancer lines MCF7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231. CYP3A4 silencing blocks the cell cycle at the G(2)/M checkpoint and induces apoptosis in the MCF7 line, thereby inhibiting anchorage-dependent growth and survival. CYP3A4 was profiled for NADPH-dependent arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism and synthesized AA epoxygenase products (±)-8,9-, (±)-11,12-, and (±)-14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) (total turnover of ∼2 pmol/pmol CYP3A4/min) but not hydroxylase products (±)-15-, (±)-19-, or 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Furthermore, eicosanoid profiling revealed that MCF7 cells synthesize EETs in a CYP3A4-dependent manner. The (±)-14,15-EET regioisomer selectively rescues breast cancer cells from CYP3A4 silencing in a concentration-dependent fashion and promotes mitogenesis and anchorage-dependent cloning. Stat3 (Tyr-705) phosphorylation was inhibited by CYP3A4 silencing, providing a potential mechanism for CYP3A4 involvement in breast cancer cell growth. Silencing Stat3 blocks breast cancer cell growth and abrogates (±)-14,15-EET-induced proliferation, indicating a Stat3 requirement for (±)-14,15-EET-mediated cell growth. Although silencing of CYP3A4 reduces nuclear Tyr(P)-705-Stat3, (±)-14,15-EET restores this signaling process and promotes Tyr(P)-705-Stat3 translocation to the nucleus, suggesting that (±)-14,15-EET may be involved in an autocrine/paracrine pathway driving cell growth. These studies indicate that CYP3A4 is a highly active AA epoxygenase that promotes Stat3-mediated breast cancer cell growth in part through (±)-14,15-EET biosynthesis. Furthermore, these studies indicate an essential role for Stat3 as a mediator of epoxygenase activity in breast cancer.
SDS normally is strictly avoided during Blue native (BN) PAGE because it leads to disassembly of protein complexes and unfolding of proteins. Here, we report a modified BN-PAGE procedure, which is based on low-SDS treatment of biological samples prior to native gel electrophoresis. Using mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes from Arabidopsis as a model system, low SDS concentrations are shown to partially dissect protein complexes in a very defined and reproducible way. If combined with 2-D BN/SDS-PAGE, generated subcomplexes and their subunits can be systematically investigated, allowing insights into the internal architecture of protein complexes. Furthermore, a 3-D BN/low-SDS BN/SDS-PAGE system is introduced to facilitate structural analysis of individual protein complexes without their previous purification.
PTEN inactivation selectively in smooth muscle cells (SMC) initiates multiple downstream events driving neointima formation, including SMC cytokine/chemokine production, in particular stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α). We investigated the effects of SDF-1α on resident SMC and bone marrow-derived cells and in mediating neointima formation.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene, which is frequently mutated and involved in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in a variety of human tumors including endometrium. We hypothesized that PTEN expression in endometrium is variable throughout the menstrual cycle as well as different endometrial lesions, and that steroid hormones regulate PTEN expression because PTEN is critical in many steroid-sensitive tissues such as endometrium.
SLC6A18 (solute carrier family 6, member 18) acts as a specific transporter for neurotransmitters, amino acids and osmolytes such as betaine, taurine and creatine. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the human SLC6A18 gene and myocardial infarction (MI) in a Japanese population.
SOD1 mutations account for less than 25 % of cases with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and may cause atypical phenotypes.
PTEN is among the most frequently inactivated tumour suppressor genes in sporadic cancer. PTEN has dual protein and lipid phosphatase activity, and its tumour suppressor activity is dependent on its lipid phosphatase activity, which negatively regulates the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Germline mutations in PTEN have been described in a variety of rare syndromes that are collectively known as the PTEN hamartoma tumour syndromes (PHTS). Cowden syndrome is the best-described syndrome within PHTS, with approximately 80% of patients having germline PTEN mutations. Patients with Cowden syndrome have an increased incidence of cancers of the breast, thyroid and endometrium, which correspond to sporadic tumour types that commonly exhibit somatic PTEN inactivation. Pten deletion in mice leads to Cowden syndrome-like phenotypes, and tissue-specific Pten deletion has provided clues to the role of PTEN mutation and loss in specific tumour types. Studying PTEN in the continuum of rare syndromes, common cancers and mouse models provides insight into the role of PTEN in tumorigenesis and will inform targeted drug development.
ABCB1 is a membrane transporter ubiquitously expressed particularly in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Resistance to drugs is associated with genetic variations of its gene and with modulation of its expression through the pregnane-X-receptor (PXR) transcription factor. We have previously shown that ABCB1 polymorphisms were associated with blood lipid concentrations.
SLC1A1 encodes a neuronal glutamate transporter and is a promising candidate gene for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Several independent research groups have reported significant associations between OCD and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this gene. Previously, we evaluated 13 SNPs in, or near, SLC1A1 and reported a strong association signal with rs301443, a SNP 7.5 kb downstream of the gene [Shugart et al. (2009); Am J Med Genet Part B 150B:886–892]. The aims of the current study were first, to further investigate this finding by saturating the region around rs301443; and second, to explore the entire gene more thoroughly with a dense panel of SNP markers. We genotyped an additional 111 SNPs in or near SLC1A1, covering from 9 kb upstream to 84 kb downstream of the gene at average spacing of 1.7 kb per SNP, and conducted family-based association analyses in 1,576 participants in 377 families.We found that none of the surrounding markers were in linkage disequilibrium with rs301443, nor were any associated with OCD. We also found that SNP rs4740788, located about 8.8 kb upstream of the gene, was associated with OCD in all families (P = 0.003) and in families with male affecteds (P = 0.002). A three-SNP haplotype (rs4740788–rs10491734–rs10491733) was associated with OCD in the total sample (P = 0.00015) and in families with male affecteds (P = 0.0007). Although of nominal statistical significance considering the number of comparisons, these findings provide further support for the involvement of SLC1A1 in the pathogenesis of OCD.
OAT (organic anion transporter) 2 [human gene symbol SLC22A7 (SLC is solute carrier)] is a member of the SLC22 family of transport proteins. In the rat, the principal site of expression of OAT2 is the sinusoidal membrane domain of hepatocytes. The particular physiological function of OAT2 in liver has been unresolved so far. In the present paper, we have used the strategy of LC (liquid chromatography)-MS difference shading to search for specific and cross-species substrates of OAT2. Heterologous expression of human and rat OAT2 in HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells stimulated accumulation of the zwitterion trigonelline; subsequently, orotic acid was identified as an excellent and specific substrate of OAT2 from the rat (clearance=106 μl·min⁻¹·mg of protein⁻¹) and human (46 μl·min⁻¹·mg of protein⁻¹). The force driving uptake of orotic acid was identified as glutamate antiport. Efficient transport of glutamate by OAT2 was directly demonstrated by uptake of [³H]glutamate. However, because of high intracellular glutamate, OAT2 operates as glutamate efflux transporter. Thus expression of OAT2 markedly increased the release of glutamate (measured by LC-MS) from cells, even without extracellular exchange substrate. Orotic acid strongly trans-stimulated efflux of glutamate. We thus propose that OAT2 physiologically functions as glutamate efflux transporter. OAT2 mRNA was detected, after laser capture microdissection of rat liver slices, equally in periportal and pericentral regions; previous reports of hepatic release of glutamate into blood can now be explained by OAT2 activity. A specific OAT2 inhibitor could, by lowering plasma glutamate and thus promoting brain-to-blood efflux of glutamate, alleviate glutamate exotoxicity in acute brain conditions.
CD38 is commonly regarded as an activation marker for human T cells. Herein, we show that CD38 expression identifies a hypo-proliferative CD4(+) T-cell subset that, following TCR stimulation, retains expression of naive cell surface markers including CD45RA, CD62L and CCR7. Hypo-proliferation was mediated by reduced CD25 up-regulation upon TCR stimulation compared to CD4(+) CD38(-) cells and lack of responsiveness to exogenous IL-2. Instead, CD4(+) CD38(+) T cells expressed CD127, and hypo-proliferation was reversed by addition of IL-7, further associated with increased STAT5 phosphorylation. This phenotype was exacerbated by addition of an agonistic CD38-binding antibody, suggesting that signaling through CD38 promotes this cell profile. Activated CD4(+) CD38(+) cells had a bias towards IL-13 secretion, but not other Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 or IL-5. In comparison, the CD4(+) CD38(-) cells had a clear bias towards secretion of Th1-associated cytokines IFN-γ and TNF. The existence of such CD4(+) CD38(+) T cells may play an important role in pathologies such as asthma, which are associated with IL-13, but not IL-4 and IL-5. Coupled with responsiveness to IL-7 but not IL-2, and the involvement of CD38 ligation, our results highlight a unique T-cell subpopulation that does not fit into existing naive and memory cell paradigms.
G6PC3 is a widely expressed isoform of glucose-6-phosphatase, found in many foetal and adult tissues. Mutations in this gene cause developmental abnormalities and severe neutropenia due to abolition of glucose recycling between the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum. Low G6PC3 expression as a result of promoter polymorphisms or dysregulation could produce similar outcomes. Here we investigated the regulation of human G6PC3 promoter activity. HeLa and H4IIE cells were transiently transfected with G6PC3 promoter coupled to the firefly luciferase gene, and promoter activity was measured by dual luciferase assay. Activity was highest in a 453 bp segment of the G6PC3 promoter, from -455 to -3 relative to the transcriptional start site. This promoter was unresponsive to glucostatic hormones. Its activity increased significantly between 1 and 5.5 mM glucose, and was not elevated further by glucose concentrations up to 25 mM. Pyruvate increased its activity, but β-hydroxybutyrate and sodium acetate did not. Promoter activity was reduced by inhibitors of hexokinase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase and the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, but not by a transketolase inhibitor. Deletion of two adjacent Enhancer-boxes (-274 to -279 and -299 to -304) reduced promoter activity and abolished the glucose effect, suggesting they could function as a glucose response element. Deletion of an additional downstream 140 bp (-140 to -306) restored activity, but not the glucose response, suggesting the presence of repressor elements in this region. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) reduced promoter activity, showing dependence on AMP-kinase. Regulation of the G6PC3 promoter is thus radically different to that of the hepatic isoform, G6PC. It is sensitive to carbohydrate, but not to fatty acid metabolites, and at much lower physiological concentrations. Based on these findings, we speculate that reduced G6PC3 expression could occur during hypoglycemic episodes in vivo, which are common in utero and in the postnatal period. If such episodes lower G6PC3 expression they could place the foetus or infant at risk of impaired immune function and development, and this possibility requires further examination both in vitro and in vivo.
CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 are involved in the metabolism of carcinogens. The effect of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 polymorphisms as genetic modifiers of risk was investigated in individuals with asbestos, silica dust or ionizing radiation-induced occupational tumours compared to exposed non-cancer subjects suffering from pneumoconiosis, particularly in relation to tobacco smoking. CYP1A1 T6235C, CYP1A1 A4889G and CYP1B1 codon 432 polymorphisms were determined by real-time PCR analysis in patients with asbestos-related lung cancer (n=39), patients with diffuse malignant mesotheliomas (n=19), lung cancer in silicosis patients (n=7), uranium miners with lung cancer (UMLC) (n=40), patients with asbestosis (n=181), and silicosis patients (n=204). The results were compared to those from a healthy unexposed control group (n=50) not exposed to carcinogenic (or fibrogenic) agents in the workplace. An additional healthy control group (n=134) comprised smokers and ex-smokers. Allele frequencies were within the range described for Caucasians. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with occupational diseases with the susceptible CYP1A1 T6235C genotype had a calculated risk ranging from OR=0.5 (95% CI 0.18-1.36) for UMLC to OR=1.23 (95% CI 0.39-4.05) for uranium miners with silicosis. The risk for patients with the susceptible CYP1A1 A4889G allele was calculated as being between OR=0.39 (95% CI 0.10-1.54) for mesothelioma patients and OR=1.54 (95% CI 0.49-4.89) for UMLC. CYP1B1 Val432Leu polymorphisms were associated with a risk of OR=0.56 (95% CI 0.2-1.55) for UMLC and OR=1.52 (95% CI 0.68-3.39) for asbestos-exposed lung cancer patients. By analyzing the interaction between tobacco smoking, type of exposure to carcinogens and the genotypes, it was determined that smoking and the presence of the susceptible genotypes did not have a combined effect. In this pilot study, the analyzed polymorphism had no consistent modifying effect on pneumoconiosis or occupationally related tumours.
WWOX is a tumour suppressor gene that spans the common fragile site FRA16D. Analysis of the WWOX expression pattern in normal human tissues showed the highest expression in testis, prostate, and ovary. Its altered expression has been demonstrated in different tissues and tumour types. The WWOX gene encodes a 414-amino acids protein, which is the first discovered protein with a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) central domain and two WW domains at the NH2 terminus. Due to its potential role in sex-steroid metabolism, using two bacterial expression systems, we have cloned WWOX fusion proteins showing oxidoreductase activity in a crude extract, defined a course of enzymatic reactions for selected steroid substrates, and determined related Km values. Our results show that the SDR domain of the WWOX protein has dehydrogenase activity and is reactive both in the presence of NAD+ and NADP+ for all examined steroid substrates. On the other hand, with the same substrates and reduced cofactors (NADH and NADPH) reduction activity was not observed.
CD36 modulates platelet function via binding to oxidized LDL (oxLDL), cell-derived microparticles, and thrombospondin-1. We hypothesized that the level of platelet CD36 expression may be associated with inheritance of specific genetic polymorphisms and that this would determine platelet reactivity to oxLDL. Analysis of more than 500 subjects revealed that CD36 expression levels were consistent in individual donors over time but varied widely among donors (200-14,000 molecules per platelet). Platelet aggregometry and flow cytometry in a subset of subjects with various CD36 expression levels revealed a high level of correlation (r² = 0.87) between platelet activation responses to oxLDL and level of CD36 expression. A genome-wide association study of 374 white subjects from the Cleveland Clinic ASCLOGEN study showed strong associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms in CD36 with platelet surface CD36 expression. Most of these findings were replicated in a smaller subset of 25 black subjects. An innovative gene-based genome-wide scan provided further evidence that single nucleotide polymorphisms in CD36 were strongly associated with CD36 expression. These studies show that CD36 expression on platelets varies widely, correlates with functional responses to oxLDL, and is associated with inheritance of specific CD36 genetic polymorphisms, and suggest that inheritance of specific CD36 polymorphisms could affect thrombotic risk.
CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 are two extrahepatic enzymes that have been implicated in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Selective inhibition of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 by dietary constituents, notably the class of flavonoids, is a widely accepted paradigm that supports the concept of dietary chemoprevention. In parallel, recent studies have documented the ability of CYP1 enzymes to selectively metabolize dietary flavonoids to conversion products that inhibit cancer cell proliferation. In the present study we have examined the inhibition of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1-catalyzed EROD activity by 14 different flavonoids containing methoxy- and hydroxyl-group substitutions as well as the metabolism of the monomethoxylated CYP1-flavonoid inhibitor acacetin and the poly-methoxylated flavone eupatorin-5-methyl ether by recombinant CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. The most potent inhibitors of CYP1-EROD activity were the methoxylated flavones acacetin, diosmetin, eupatorin and the di-hydroxylated flavone chrysin, indicating that the 4'-OCH(3) group at the B ring and the 5,7-dihydroxy motif at the A ring play a prominent role in EROD inhibition. Potent inhibition of CYP1B1 EROD activity was also obtained for the poly-hydroxylated flavonols quercetin and myricetin. HPLC metabolism of acacetin by CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 revealed the formation of the structurally similar flavone apigenin by demethylation at the 4'-position of the B ring, whereas the flavone eupatorin-5-methyl ether was metabolized to an as yet unidentified metabolite assigned E(5)M1. Eupatorin-5-methyl ether demonstrated a submicromolar IC(50) in the CYP1-expressing cancer cell line MDA-MB 468, while it was considerably inactive in the normal cell line MCF-10A. Homology modeling in conjunction with molecular docking calculations were employed in an effort to rationalize the activity of these flavonoids based on their CYP1-binding mode. Taken together the data suggest that dietary flavonoids exhibit three distinct modes of action with regard to cancer prevention, based on their hydroxyl and methoxy decoration: (1) inhibitors of CYP1 enzymatic activity, (2) CYP1 substrates and (3) substrates and inhibitors of CYP1 enzymes.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene localized to human chromosome 10q23.31, a genomic region frequently lost in glioblastoma and prostate cancer. The fact that PTEN encodes a lipid phosphatase with specificity towards phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate renders it a gate-keeper of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Numerous physiological processes have been ascribed to this evolutionarily conserved molecule including proliferation, cell size determination, survival, differentiation, and cell fate specification. Indeed, mutation in PTEN gene is the genetic cause of Cowden Syndrome. Structurally, the 54-kilodalton protein is composed of two major functional domains crucial for catalytic and membrane binding functions. Additional regulatory regions in both amino- and carboxyl-termini further dictate its structural integrity, catalytic activity, and subcellular localization. Extensive characterization of PTEN primary coding sequence has revealed a multitude of post-translational modifications that fine-tune its biochemical properties. These include phosphorylation, ubiquitination, redox modifications, and acetylation. This article aims to provide an in-depth review of the diverse post-translational modifications of PTEN, focusing on their biological relevance in both normal and cancer cells. The potential applications to cancer therapy by modulating the post-translational modifications of PTEN will also be discussed.
"HMGCS2 (hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA synthase 2), the gene that regulates ketone body production, is barely expressed in cultured cell lines. In this study, we restored HMGCS2 expression and activity in HepG2 cells, thus showing that the wild type enzyme can induce fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) and ketogenesis, whereas a catalytically inactive mutant C166A did not generate either process. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α expression also induces fatty acid β-oxidation and endogenous HMGCS2 expression. Interestingly, PPARα-mediated induction was abolished when HMGCS2 expression was down-regulated by RNAi. These results indicate that HMGCS2 expression is both sufficient and necessary to the control of fatty acid oxidation in these cells. Next, we examined the expression pattern of several PPARα target genes in this now ""ketogenic"" HepG2 cell line. FGF21 (fibroblast growth factor 21) expression was specifically induced by HMGCS2 activity or by the inclusion of the oxidized form of ketone bodies (acetoacetate) in the culture medium. This effect was blunted by SirT1 (sirtuin 1) RNAi, so we propose a SirT1-dependent mechanism for FGF21 induction by acetoacetate. These data suggest a novel feed-forward mechanism by which HMGCS2 could regulate adaptive metabolic responses during fasting. This mechanism could be physiologically relevant, because fasting-mediated induction of liver FGF21 was dependent on SirT1 activity in vivo."
ABO and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alloantibodies provide major immunologic barriers to successful transplantation; however, there is increasing recognition for the role of anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECAs) in allograft rejection. We investigated the relationship between AECAs identified using donor-derived endothelial cell precursors (ECPs) and kidney allograft rejection and function.
CYP11A1 encodes the first enzyme of steroid biosynthesis, cytochrome P450scc. The expression of CYP11A1 in the nervous system allows neurosteroids to be synthesized de novo. In the classic steroidogenic tissues, adrenals and gonads, the key regulator controlling CYP11A1 expression is steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), but the transcriptional regulation of CYP11A1 in the brain is unclear. We recently used the 4.4-kb regulatory region of the human CYP11A1 gene to drive Cre recombinase expression in the diencephalon and midbrain. In this study, we characterized the regional-specific expression of Cre reporter in the SCC-Cre transgenic brain using a transient Cre/ROSA26R transgenic system. Mutation of either the upstream or proximal SF-1 binding site did not affect brain CYP11A1 promoter activity. The upstream SF-1 binding site, however, is required for CYP11A1 promoter function in the embryonic adrenals. The 3.8-kb promoter, like the 4.4-kb length promoter, directed Cre expression in the diencephalon, midbrain and olfactory epithelium, whereas Cre expression controlled by the 2.7-kb promoter was only observed in the caudal part of midbrain. This suggests that the 5'-flanking region between 3.8 and 2.7 kb contains a crucial element for activation of CYP11A1 promoter in the diencephalon, olfactory epithelium and the anterior part of midbrain. Thus we have identified regions of the promoter that control CYP11A1 expression in the brain and embryonic adrenals.
CFTR mutations enhance susceptibility for idiopathic chronic pancreatitis (ICP) and congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD); however, it is unknown why CFTR heterozygotes are at increased disease risk. We recently showed that common CFTR variants are associated with aberrantly spliced transcripts. Here, we genotyped for common CFTR variants and tested for associations in two ICP (ICP-A: 126 patients, 319 controls; ICP-B: 666 patients, 1,181 controls) and a CBAVD population (305 patients, 319 controls). Haplotype H10 (TG11-T7-470V) conferred protection (ICP-A: OR 0.19, P<0.0001; ICP-B: OR 0.78, P = 0.06; CBAVD OR 0.08, P<0.001), whereas haplotype H3 (TG10-T7-470M) increased disease risk (ICP-A: OR 8.34, P = 0.003; ICP-B: OR 1.88, P = 0.007; CBAVD: OR 5.67, P = 0.01). The risk of heterozygous CFTR mutations carriers for ICP (OR 2.44, P<0.001) and CBAVD (OR 14.73, P<0.001) was fully abrogated by the H10/H10 genotype. Similarly, ICP risk of heterozygous p.Asn34Ser SPINK1 mutation carriers (OR 10.34, P<0.001) was compensated by H10/H10. Thus, common CFTR haplotypes modulate ICP and CBAVD susceptibility alone and in heterozygous CFTR and p.Asn34Ser mutation carriers. Determination of these haplotypes helps to stratify carriers into high- and low-risk subjects, providing helpful information for genetic counseling.
ABCG2 protein overexpression and FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) correlate with higher relapse rate and shorter disease-free survival (DFS) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but no data are available on the possible effect of concomitant presence of these 2 factors.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) plays critical roles in multiple cellular processes, including cell proliferation, survival, migration and transformation. A role of PTEN in mammalian spermatogenesis, however, has not been explored. To address this question, we generated a mouse model with PTEN conditional knockout in postnatal male germ cells. We found that spermatogenesis was normal in PTEN-deleted male germ cells. PTEN conditional mutant males produced sperm and sired offspring as competently as wild-type littermates. Moreover, our biochemical analysis also indicated that the Akt (acutely transforming retrovirus AKT8 in rodent T cell lymphoma) signalling pathway was not affected in mutant testis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PTEN is dispensable in mouse spermatogenesis.
CD38 catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a Ca(2+) messenger responsible for regulating a wide range of physiological functions. It is generally regarded as an ectoenzyme, but its intracellular localization has also been well documented. It is not known if internal CD38 is enzymatically active and contributes to the Ca(2+) signaling function. In this study, we engineered a novel soluble form of CD38 that can be efficiently expressed in the cytosol and use cytosolic NAD as a substrate to produce cADPR intracellularly. The activity of the engineered CD38 could be decreased by mutating the catalytic residue Glu-226 and increased by the double mutation E146A/T221F, which increased its cADPR synthesis activity by >11-fold. Remarkably, the engineered CD38 exhibited the ability to form the critical disulfide linkages required for its enzymatic activity. This was verified by using a monoclonal antibody generated against a critical disulfide, Cys-254-Cys-275. The specificity of the antibody was established by x-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis. The engineered CD38 is thus a novel example challenging the general belief that cytosolic proteins do not possess disulfides. As a further refinement of this approach, the engineered CD38 was placed under the control of tetracycline using an autoregulated construct. This study has set the stage for in vivo manipulation of cADPR metabolism.
NPC1L1 is the molecular target of the cholesterol lowering drug Ezetimibe and mediates the intestinal absorption of cholesterol. Inhibition or deletion of NPC1L1 reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption, resulting in reduction of plasma cholesterol levels.
CYP2C9 is a major enzyme in human drug metabolism and the polymorphism observed in the corresponding gene may affect therapeutic outcome during treatment. The distribution of variant CYP2C9 alleles and prevalence of phenytoin adverse reactions were hereby investigated in a population of patients diagnosed with epilepsy.
CYP7B1 mutations have been linked directly with the neurodegenerative disease hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), with mutations in the CYP7B1 gene identified as being directly responsible for autosomal recessive HSP type 5A (SPG5). To evaluate the potential impact of CYP7B1 mutations identified in SPG5 on binding and protein function, a comparative model of cytochrome P450 7B1 (CYP7B1) was constructed using human CYP7A1 as a template during model construction. The secondary structure was predicted using the PSIPRED and GOR4 prediction methods, the lowest energy CYP7B1 model was generated using MOE, and then this model was assessed in terms of stereochemical quality and the side chain environment using RAMPAGE, Verify3D and ProSA. Evaluation of the active site residues of the CYP7B1 model and validation of the active site architecture were performed via molecular docking experiments: the docking of the substrates 25-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol and the inhibitor 3α-Adiol identified structurally and functionally important residues. Mutational analysis of CYP7B1 amino acid mutations related to hereditary spastic paraplegia type 5 considered phosphorylation, ligand/substrate binding and the structural roles of mutated amino acid residues, with R112, T297 and S363 mutations expected to have a direct impact on ligand binding, while mutations involving R417 would indirectly affect ligand binding as a result of impairment in catalytic function.
CYP2D6 is an important drug-metabolizing enzyme. The polymorphism of CYP2D6 leads to metabolism difference and the different reactions of drugs in the individuals and different races are normal phenomenon in clinical medication. CYP2D6*10 is an important subtype in Asian people and 51.3% Chinese are classified with this subtype. To obtain recombinant active CYP2D6*1/CYP2D6*10 in baculovirus system by optimizing coexpression with CYPOR, and detect their activity to catalyze dextromethorphan, three recombinants pFastBac-CYP2D6*1, pFastBac-CYP2D6*10 and pFastBac-CYPOR were constructed and transformed into DH10Bac cell to obtain the recombinant Bacmid-CYPOR, Bacmid-CYP2D6*1 and Bacmid-CYP2D6*10. And then the recombinant CYP2D6*1 and CYP2D6*10 virus were obtained by transfecting Sf9. Then homogenate protein activity was determined with dextromethorphan as substrate. The multiple of infection (MOI) and its ratio of recombinant CYP2D6 virus to CYPOR virus were adjusted by detecting the activity of the homogenate protein. The Km and Vmax are 26.67 +/- 2.71 micromol x L(-1) (n=3) and 666.7 +/- 56.78 pmol x nmol(-1) (CYP2D6) x min(-1) (n=3) for CYP2D6*1 to catalyze dextromethaphan. The Km and Vmax are 111.36 +/- 10.89 micromol x L(-1) (n=3) and 222.2 +/- 20.12 pmol x nmol(-1) (CYP2D6) x min(-1) (n=3) for CYP2D6*10 to catalyze dextromethorphan. There is significant difference between CYP2D6*1 and CYP2D6*10 for Vmax and Km (P < 0.01). The clearance ratio of CYP2D6*1 is 25.0 and the clearance ratio of CYP2D6*10 is 2.0. The expressed CYP2D6*1 and CYP2D6*10 are useful tools to screen the metabolism profile of many xenobiotics and endobiotics in vitro, which are benefit to understand individual metabolism difference.
SLC22A12 gene, encoding urate transport 1, has been known to be responsible to urate metabolism. This study sought to determine the association between the novel G109T polymorphism in SLC22A12 with serum uric acid and the development of metabolic syndrome in Korean male subjects. A total of 132 healthy male subjects were enrolled in this study. Metabolic syndrome was determined using the modified guidelines for metabolic syndrome proposed by the National Cholesterol Education Program's Third Adult Treatment Panel. Genotyping for the SLC22A12 gene was assessed using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Serum uric acid and fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA) from blood and urine samples were measured. Frequencies of the 109GG, 109GT, and 109TT genotypes were 57.6, 38.6, and 3.8%, respectively. Serum uric acid levels and FEUAs were significantly different among the three genotypes of the G109T polymorphism (P = 0.035 and P = 0.033, respectively). In addition, subjects of genotypes with the T allele had lower uric acid levels and higher FEUAs compared to those with the 109GG genotype (P = 0.007 and P = 0.031, respectively). The G109T polymorphism of the SLC22A12 gene has no association with metabolic syndrome. However, a number of metabolic syndrome components were related to serum uric acid level (r = 0.285, P = 0.001) and also significantly different between genotype with and without T allele (P = 0.008). The novel G109T polymorphism of the SLC22A12 gene is related to serum uric acid level, but not to the development of metabolic syndrome.
CFTR functions as a chloride channel at the apical membrane of airway, gastrointestinal, and other epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy is commonly used to assess the subcellular localization and relative abundance of CFTR. Visualization of heterologously overexpressed CFTR is typically unproblematic and straightforward, whereas detection of small quantities of endogenous CFTR in tissues can be challenging and requires highly specific antibodies and optimized staining protocols. CFTR tagged by green fluorescent protein can be employed to study trafficking in live cells. Tagging of CFTR with an extracellular epitope permits detection exclusively at the cell surface and subsequent chasing allows visualization of endocytic trafficking.
UCP3 (uncoupling protein-3) mitigates mitochondrial ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Previous studies have also examined UCP3 effects, including decreased ROS production, during metabolic states when fatty acid oxidation is high (e.g. a fasting state). However, the role of UCP3 when carbohydrate oxidation is high (e.g. fed state) has remained largely unexplored. In the present study, we show that mitochondrial-bound HK (hexokinase) II curtails oxidative stress and enhances aerobic metabolism of glucose in the fed state in a UCP3-dependent manner. Genetic knockout or inhibition of UCP3 significantly decreased mitochondrial-bound HKII. Furthermore, UCP3 was required for the HKII-mediated decrease in mitochondrial ROS emission. Intriguingly, the UCP3-mediated modulation of mitochondria-associated HKII was only observed in cells cultured under high-glucose conditions. UCP3 was required to maintain high rates of aerobic metabolism in high-glucose-treated cells and in muscle of fed mice. Deficiency in UCP3 resulted in a metabolic shift that favoured anaerobic glycolytic metabolism, increased glucose uptake and increased sensitivity to oxidative challenge. PET (positron emission tomography) of [18F]fluoro-deoxyglucose uptake confirmed these findings in UCP3-knockout and wild-type mice. Collectively, our findings link the anti-oxidative and metabolic functions of UCP3 through a surprising molecular connection with mitochondrial-bound HKII.
PTEN dephosphorylates the 3-position phosphate of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate (PIP(3)), thereby inhibiting AKT activation. Although attenuation of PTEN function has a major role in tumourigenesis, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that α-mannosidase 2C1 (MAN2C1) inhibits PTEN function in prostate cancer (PC) cells and is associated with a reduction in PTEN function in primary PC. MAN2C1 activates AKT and promotes the formation of PTEN-positive DU145 cell-derived xenograft tumours by imparing endogenous PTEN function. In 659 PC patients who were examined, ~60% of tumours were PTEN positive with elevated AKT activation. Of these, 80% display MAN2C1 overexpression that co-localizes with PTEN. Increases in MAN2C1 were detected only in PTEN-positive prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinomas, and showed a significant association with PC recurrence only in patients with PTEN-positive PCs. Mechanistically, MAN2C1 binds PTEN thereby inhibiting its PIP(3) phosphatase activity. These findings show that MAN2C1 function as a PTEN-negative regulator in PC cells.
PGD is nowadays a well-established alternative to prenatal diagnosis. However, information with respect to couples' motives and profiles for choosing PGD is scarce.
PTEN is a critical gene involved in the regulation of many cellular processes. The product of this gene has dual phosphatase activity and is able to dephosphorylate the 5' end of the phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. Within the cellular nucleus, this protein has been associated with regulation of the expression of many genes, although the mechanism of this regulation remains unclear. In this paper, two specific oligonucleotide aptamers were developed and selected, using the SELEX procedure, according to their ability to detect the PTEN protein in different subcellular compartments of neurons. While one aptamer was able to detect PTEN in the nucleus, the other recognized PTEN in the cytoplasm. The recognition pattern of PTEN by both aptamers was confirmed using antibodies in western blots of the proteins purified from mouse cerebellar homogenates and subcellular fractions. Additionally, we demonstrated that the two aptamers recognized different epitopes of the target peptide. The results presented here could not be fully explained by the canonical phosphatase structure of PTEN, suggesting the existence of different conformations of phosphatase in the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
ABO incompatibility in maternal-fetal relationship has been shown to cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDNB); a survey which is not yet done in this locality.
AKR1B10 (aldo-keto reductase family 1, member B10) protein is primarily expressed in normal human small intestine and colon, but overexpressed in several types of human cancers and considered as a tumour marker. In the present study, we found that AKR1B10 protein is secreted from normal intestinal epithelium and cultured cancer cells, as detected by a newly developed sandwich ELISA and Western blotting. The secretion of AKR1B10 was not affected by the protein-synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and the classical protein-secretion pathway inhibitor brefeldin A, but was stimulated by temperature, ATP, Ca(2+) and the Ca(2+) carrier ionomycin, lysosomotropic NH(4)Cl, the G-protein activator GTPγS and the G-protein coupling receptor N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. The ADP-ribosylation factor inhibitor 2-(4-fluorobenzoylamino)-benzoic acid methyl ester and the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 inhibited the secretion of AKR1B10. In cultured cells, AKR1B10 was present in lysosomes and was secreted with cathepsin D, a lysosomal marker. In the intestine, AKR1B10 was specifically expressed in mature epithelial cells and secreted into the lumen at 188.6-535.7 ng/ml of ileal fluids (mean=298.1 ng/ml, n=11). Taken together, our results demonstrate that AKR1B10 is a new secretory protein belonging to a lysosome-mediated non-classical protein-secretion pathway and is a potential serum marker.
CD38 participates in lymphocyte ontogeny and function and may be involved in autoimmunity. Absence of CD38 accelerates development of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice diabetes and anti-CD38 antibodies are good markers of human disease. Little is known regarding systemic autoimmunity. Active SLE patients have higher numbers of CD38(+) T and B cells. CD38 is a candidate gene for the murine Lmb2 lupus locus. We aimed to investigate whether CD38 was involved in lupus development.
CFTR is a member of the ATP-binding cassette family of membrane proteins. This is one of the best characterised membrane protein families in terms of structure and function. CFTR operates as an ion channel, unlike nearly all other family members which are active transporters. Here, we discuss methods that have allowed such data to be obtained for CFTR.
CFTR is the only member of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) protein superfamily known to function as an ion channel. Most other ABC proteins are ATP-driven transporters, in which a cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis, at intracellular nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), powers uphill substrate translocation across the membrane. In CFTR, this same ATP-driven cycle opens and closes a transmembrane pore through which chloride ions flow rapidly down their electrochemical gradient. Detailed analysis of the pattern of gating of CFTR channels thus offers the opportunity to learn about mechanisms of function not only of CFTR channels but also of their ABC transporter ancestors. In addition, CFTR channel gating is subject to complex regulation by kinase-mediated phosphorylation at multiple consensus sites in a cytoplasmic regulatory domain that is unique to CFTR. Here we offer a practical guide to extract useful information about the mechanisms that control opening and closing of CFTR channels: on how to plan (including information obtained from analysis of multiple sequence alignments), carry out, and analyze electrophysiological and biochemical experiments, as well as on how to circumvent potential pitfalls.
SLC11A1 has pleiotropic effects on macrophage function and remains a strong candidate for infectious disease susceptibility. 5' and/or 3' polymorphisms have been associated with tuberculosis, leprosy, and visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Most studies undertaken to date were under-powered, and none has been replicated within a population. Association with tuberculosis has replicated variably across populations. Here we investigate SLC11A1 and VL in India.
SLC25A12 was previously identified by a linkage-directed association analysis in autism. In this study, we investigated the relationship between three SLC25A12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs2056202, rs908670 and rs2292813) and restricted repetitive behavior (RRB) traits in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), based on a positive correlation between the G allele of rs2056202 and an RRB subdomain score on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R).
UGT2B17 is one of the most important enzymes for androgen metabolism. In addition, the UGT2B17 gene is one of the most commonly deleted regions of the human genome. The deletion was previously found associated with higher femoral bone density in men and women, and we replicated this association in a sample of postmenopausal who never used hormone therapy.
PIK3CA gene mutations are the most common activating mutations in human breast cancer. Its association with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer makes it a prime target for clinical therapeutic advances to maintain anti-estrogen responsiveness. In anticipation of this therapeutic approach, we have evaluated intratumoral heterogeneity in primary breast cancers with regard to PIK3CA mutation status. In addition, we have assessed for the presence of the mutation in paired pre-invasive breast cancer and metastases. To assess for intratumoral heterogeneity, separate tumor blocks from primary breast cancers (n = 63) were genotyped for PIK3CA mutations. Available paired tissue samples from breast tumors known to harbor mutations underwent massARRAY genotyping (n = 70) to identify PIK3CA and AKT1(E17K) mutations. Cores were macro-dissected from matched tissue, including normal breast, benign lymph nodes (LN), ductal carcinoma in situ, regional LN metastases, and distant metastases. Matched samples underwent genetic fingerprinting by multiple SNP genotyping to confirm genetic identity. Intratumoral heterogeneity is minimal with a concordance rate of 95.2% between two different blocks from primary breast cancers. Complete concordance of PIK3CA mutations is noted between primary breast cancer and DCIS. PIK3CA mutations in primary breast cancer are detected in matched regional LNs (91.7%) and distant metastases (100%). Mutation detection by massARRAY genotyping is sensitive but may be affected by sample quality. Intratumoral heterogeneity as measured by PIK3CA genotype is rare; PIK3CA mutations occur early and are selected for in breast cancer progression. HapMap analysis is an essential control for paired sample analysis. This data is clinically important, particularly, for the design of therapies targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway, as it offers confidence that the detection of PIK3CA mutations in the invasive primary tumor will accurately reflect breast cancer biology.
SOD1 G93D mutation has been described in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with slowly progressive disease. We describe an Italian patient affected by sporadic ALS with the SOD1 G93D mutation that disclosed an unusual rapid progression with death occurring after 30 months from the symptom onset. Considering the atypical clinical course further genes associated with ALS or known to be causative were studied including ANG, PGRN, TARDBP, FUS, VCP, CHRNA3, CHRNA4, and CHRNB4. A novel heterozygous ANG missense variant (c.433 C>T, p.R145C) was identified which is neither reported in controls nor in 1000 genomes and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) databases. This report confirms that clinical course of SOD1-related ALS may be modulated by other causative or associated genes, including ANG and suggests that extensive screening of ALS-associated genes in patients with an already identified mutation may be helpful for better knowledge of genetic architecture of ALS.
HSD3B1 gene encodes the 3β-hydroxysteroid deydrogenases/isomerase (3β-HSD) enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of all hormonal steroids. The aim of this study was to examine the potential impact of a T → C substitution at codon Leu(338) of HSD3B1 gene on pregnancy outcome.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) functions as a major tumor suppressor gene and is frequently deleted in different types of tumors including prostate cancer (PCa). It was hypothesized that germ-line genetic changes of PTEN affect susceptibility to PCa. Both common (with a minor allele frequency 5%) and rare (with a minor allele frequency <5%) germ-line variants of PTEN were comprehensively evaluated. A total of 15 germ-line variants were identified by re-sequencing the PTEN gene, including 5' untranslated region, all nine exons, exon-intron junctions and 3' untranslated region, in 188 probands of hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) families recruited from Johns Hopkins Hospital. Two microsatellite markers surrounding PTEN were used to test the co-segregation of 10 rare variants, which may give rise to highly penetrance in HPC. Two common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were evaluated in the 188 HPC families using a family-based association study approach. To study low penetrant SNPs in PCa susceptibility, 33 SNPs covering PTEN were selected from the whole genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from our available case-control studies in Sweden (Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden (CAPS)) and the publicly available cancer genetic markers of susceptibility (CGEMS) study. Germ-line copy-number variations (CNVs) in PTEN were assessed in CAPS. Co-segregation of germ-line variants and PCa was not observed among HPC families and no significant differences in the allele frequencies were observed in sporadic cases and controls, aggressive and non-aggressive PCa (P>0.05). These results suggest that germ-line variants in PTEN do not have an important role in PCa susceptibility.
ABO blood type has been associated with risk and survival for several malignancies; however, data for an association with breast cancer are inconsistent. Our study population consisted of Nurses' Health Study participants with self-reported serologic blood type and/or ABO genotype. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we examined the association between serologic blood type and incident breast cancer among 67,697 women, including 3,107 cases. In addition, we examined the association with ABO genotype in a nested case-control study of 1,138 invasive breast cancer cases and 1,090 matched controls. Finally, we evaluated the association between serologic blood type and survival among 2,036 participants with breast cancer. No clear association was seen between serologic blood type or ABO genotype and risk of total breast cancer, invasive breast cancer or breast cancer subtypes. Compared to women with blood type O, the age-adjusted incidence rate ratios for serologic blood type and total breast cancer were 1.06 (95% CI, 0.98-1.15) for type A, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.93-1.22) for AB and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.96-1.20) for B. In genetic analyses, odds ratios for invasive breast cancer were 1.05 (95% CI, 0.87-1.27) for A/O, 1.21 (95% CI, 0.86-1.69) for A/A, 0.84 (95% CI, 0.56-1.26) for A/B, 0.84 (95% CI, 0.63-1.13) for B/O and 1.17 (95% CI, 0.35-3.86) for B/B, compared to O/O. No significant association was noted between blood type and overall or breast cancer-specific mortality. Our results suggest no association between ABO blood group and breast cancer risk or survival.
ABCA1 transporter is known to play important role in the cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues. However its contribution in atherosclerosis development remains not completely understood. Using Real Time PCR, a significant reduction of ABCA1 mRNA level in leukocytes of patients with atherosclerosis was determined when compared with controls. Mean ABCA1 expression levels in leukocytes for the group of patients and for the control group are 0.57 +/- 0.28 and 0.93 +/- 0.14 (p = 0.02). At the same time we detected a significant increase of ABCA1 mRNA level in macrophages of patients when compared with controls. Mean ABCA1 expression levels in macrophages for the group of patients and for the control group are 1.32 +/- 0.10 and 0.90 +/- 0.14 (p = 0.014). In summary, we suggest that expression level of ABCA1 gene may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis.
CYP2C9 and VKORC1 are two major genetic factors associated with inter-individual variability in warfarin dose. Additionally, genes in the warfarin metabolism pathway have also been associated with dose variance. We analyzed Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes to identify genetic factors that might confer warfarin sensitivity in Indonesian patients.
ABCG2 encodes a transporter protein that is associated with multidrug-resistant phenotypes in many cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML); high levels of expression are generally associated with a poor prognosis. To better understand how expression of ABCG2 is controlled in pediatric AML, we performed a detailed analysis of the ABCG2 transcript isoforms from a variety of tissue sources, including 85 pediatric AML samples. These studies revealed a complex 5' untranslated region (UTR) with 6 novel exons and multiple splice variants. Samples from children with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AML FAB-M7) not associated with Down syndrome showed uniformly higher levels of ABCG2 transcripts than samples from children with other AML subtypes. A novel 5' UTR identified 90kb upstream of the exon 2 translation initiation site was expressed only in M7 AML subtypes. An associated upstream promoter fragment was shown to be selectively expressed in megakaryoblastic leukemia cells but not in human epithelial cell lines. These findings identify a new tissue-specific ABCG2 promoter that is selectively expressed in pediatric M7 AML. We also show a relatively high incidence of ABCG2 mRNA expression in non-Down associated M7 AML, which may contribute to the relatively poor prognosis of the M7 AML subtype.
CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme which is ubiquitously distributed in mammalian tissues. It is involved in the conversion of NAD(P)(+) into cyclic ADP-ribose, NAADP(+) and ADP-ribose and the role of these metabolites in multiple Ca(2+) signaling pathways makes CD38 a novel potential pharmacological target. The dire paucity of CD38 inhibitors, however, renders the search for new molecular tools highly desirable. We report that human CD38 is inhibited at low micromolar concentrations by flavonoids such as luteolinidin, kuromanin and luteolin (IC(50) <10 μM). Docking studies provide some clues on the mode of interaction of these molecules with the active site of CD38.
PTPMT1 was the first protein tyrosine phosphatase found localized to the mitochondria, but its biological function was unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that whole body deletion of Ptpmt1 in mice leads to embryonic lethality, suggesting an indispensable role for PTPMT1 during development. Ptpmt1 deficiency in mouse embryonic fibroblasts compromises mitochondrial respiration and results in abnormal mitochondrial morphology. Lipid analysis of Ptpmt1-deficient fibroblasts reveals an accumulation of phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP) along with a concomitant decrease in phosphatidylglycerol. PGP is an essential intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid regulating the membrane integrity and activities of the organelle. We further demonstrate that PTPMT1 specifically dephosphorylates PGP in vitro. Loss of PTPMT1 leads to dramatic diminution of cardiolipin, which can be partially reversed by the expression of catalytic active PTPMT1. Our study identifies PTPMT1 as the mammalian PGP phosphatase and points to its role as a regulator of cardiolipin biosynthesis.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is a phosphatidylinositol triphosphate 3-phosphatase that counteracts phosphoinositide 3-kinases and has subsequently been implied as a valuable drug target for diabetes and cancer. Recently, we demonstrated that VO-OHpic is an extremely potent inhibitor of PTEN with nanomolar affinity in vitro and in vivo. Given the importance of this inhibitor for future drug design and development, its mode of action needed to be elucidated. It was discovered that inhibition of recombinant PTEN by VO-OHpic is fully reversible. Both K(m) and V(max) are affected by VO-OHpic, demonstrating a noncompetitive inhibition of PTEN. The inhibition constants K(ic) and K(iu) were determined to be 27 ± 6 and 45 ± 11 nM, respectively. Using the artificial phosphatase substrate 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP) or the physiological substrate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP(3)) comparable parameters were obtained suggesting that OMFP is a suitable substrate for PTEN inhibition studies and PTEN drug screening.
CYP17A1 expression is up-regulated in the gonad in Rana (Glandirana) rugosa tadpoles treated with androgens to induce female-to-male sex-reversal. In this study, we isolated the CYP17A1 gene and its processed pseudogene from R. rugosa. The former was found to consist of 8 exons, and the latter a single-exon gene, designated CYP17A1P. The sequence of the promoter region of CYP17A1 differed from that of CYP17A1P. We found several consensus binding-sites for candidate transcription factors including androgen receptor (AR), Sox and FoxL2 in the CYP17A1 promoter region, but an AR-binding site was absent from CYP17A1P. When AR was over-expressed in Xenopus A6 cells, it did not increase CYP17A1 transcription in luciferase assays. CYP17A1 was strongly expressed in indifferent male gonads during sex determination and exclusively in testis, among eight adult tissues of R. rugosa. By contrast, CYP17A1P was expressed at very low, and similar levels in the adult tissues of both sexes. Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis showed that CYP17A1P is localized to chromosome 4, while CYP17A1 is on chromosome 9. These results collectively suggest that CYP17A1, but not CYP17A1P is involved in male sex-determination in R. rugosa, and that androgens may not have a direct effect on the CYP17A1 transcription.
CYP2D6 is a liver enzyme that metabolizes more that 25% of drugs and thus may play a pivotal role in drug-drug interactions. The promoter sequences of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) gene could impact metabolic activity.
PTEN has been considered as one of the important anti-oncogenes, which possesses very wide biological activities. Endogenous PTEN genes begin to express in epiblast during chick embryo gastrulation, and then the expression extends to neural plate and mesoderm. This suggests that PTEN might be involved in cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation during early embryo development. In this study, we employed in vivo approach to explore if endogenous PTEN participates in EMT (Epithelial-mesenchymal transition) in early chick embryo. PTEN was initially detected to highly express in primitive streak during chick gastrulation, in which EMT occurs, and subsequently mesoderm structure such as somites etc. Then, overexpression of both Wt PTEN-GFP and Wt PTEN-GFP positive transplantation of primitive streak resulted in cell accumulation in primitive streak in the development hereafter, indicating that EMT was blocked in both of our assays, either whole embryo transfection of Wt PTEN-GFP or transplantation of Wt PTEN-GFP primary streak tissue. Finally down-regulation of PTEN gene in one side using PTEN siRNA led to reduce the more number of mesoderm cells in PTNE siRNA side than normal side, which suggests that PTEN gene is probably involved in regulating EMT process in development of early embryonic gastrulation.
CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons (SRIs) express α7 nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) and receive inputs from glutamatergic neurons/axons that express α3β4β2 nAChRs. To test the hypothesis that endogenously active α7 and/or α3β4β2 nAChRs control the excitability of CA1 SRIs in the rat hippocampus, we examined the effects of selective receptor antagonists on spontaneous fast current transients (CTs) recorded from these interneurons under cell-attached configuration. The frequency of CTs, which represent action potentials, increased in the absence of extracellular Mg(2+) and decreased in the presence of the α3β4β2 nAChR antagonist mecamylamine (3 μM) or the NMDA receptor antagonist APV (50 μM). However, it was unaffected by the α7 nAChR antagonist MLA (10 nM) or the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX (10 μM). Thus, in addition to synaptically and tonically activated NMDA receptors, α3β4β2 nAChRs that are present on glutamatergic axons/neurons synapsing onto SRIs and are activated by basal levels of acetylcholine contribute to the maintenance of the excitability of these interneurons. Kynurenic acid (KYNA), an astrocyte-derived kynurenine metabolite whose levels are increased in the brains of patients with schizophrenia, also controls the excitability of SRIs. At high micromolar concentrations, KYNA, acting primarily as an NMDA receptor antagonist, decreased the CT frequency recorded from the interneurons. At 2 μM, KYNA reduced the CA1 SRI excitability via mechanisms independent of NMDA receptor block. KYNA-induced reduction of excitability of SRIs may contribute to sensory gating deficits that have been attributed to deficient hippocampal GABAergic transmission and high levels of KYNA in the brain of patients with schizophrenia.
CYP24A1 is a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 (CYP) that catabolizes 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1α,25-(OH)(2)D(3)) to different products: calcitroic acid or 1α,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-26,23-lactone via multistep pathways commencing with C24 and C23 hydroxylation, respectively. Despite the ability of CYP24A1 to catabolize a wide range of 25-hydroxylated analogs including 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3), the enzyme is unable to metabolize the synthetic prodrug, 1α-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (1α-OH-D(3)), presumably because it lacks a C25-hydroxyl. In the current study we show that a single V391L amino acid substitution in the β3a-strand of human CYP24A1 converts this enzyme from a catabolic 1α,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-24-hydroxylase into an anabolic 1α-OH-D(3)-25-hydroxylase, thereby forming the hormone, 1α,25-(OH)(2)D(3). Furthermore, because the mutant enzyme retains its basal ability to catabolize 1α,25-(OH)(2)D(3) via C24 hydroxylation, it can also make calcitroic acid. Previous work has shown that an A326G mutation is responsible for the regioselectivity differences observed between human (primarily C24-hydroxylating) and opossum (C23-hydroxylating) CYP24A1. When the V391L and A326G mutations were combined (V391L/A326G), the mutant enzyme continued to form 1α,25-(OH)(2)D(3) from 1α-OH-D(3), but this initial product was diverted via the C23 hydroxylation pathway into the 26,23-lactone. The relative position of Val-391 in the β3a-strand of a homology model and the crystal structure of rat CYP24A1 is consistent with hydrophobic contact of Val-391 and the substrate side chain near C21. We interpret that the substrate specificity of V391L-modified human CYP24A1 toward 1α-OH-D(3) is enabled by an altered contact with the substrate side chain that optimally positions C25 of the 1α-OH-D(3) above the heme for hydroxylation.
NQO1 participates in cellular defense against oxidative stress and regulates apoptosis via p53- and NFκB-mediated pathways. We have previously found that homozygous missense variant NQO1*2 (rs1800566) predicts poor survival among breast cancer patients, particularly after anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Here, we investigated NQO1 and NFκB protein expression and global gene expression profiles in breast tumors with correlation to tumor characteristics and survival after adjuvant chemotherapy. We used immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays to study NQO1 and NFκB expression in two series of tumors: 1000 breast tumors unselected for treatment and 113 from a clinical trial comparing chemotherapy regimens after anthracycline treatment in advanced breast cancer. We used gene expression arrays to define genes co-expressed with NQO1 and NFκB. NQO1 and nuclear NFκB were expressed in 83% and 11% of breast tumors, and correlated inversely (P = 0.012). NQO1 protein expression was associated with estrogen receptor (ER) expression (P = 0.011), whereas 34.5% of NFκB-nuclear/activated tumors were ER negative (P = 0.001). NQO1 protein expression and NFκB activation showed only trends, but no statistical significance for patient survival or outcome after anthracycline treatment. Gene expression analysis highlighted 193 genes that significantly correlated with both NQO1 and NFκB in opposite directions, consistent with the expression patterns of the two proteins. Inverse correlation was found with genes related to oxidation/reduction, lipid biosynthesis and steroid metabolism, immune response, lymphocyte activation, Jak-STAT signaling and apoptosis. The inverse relationship between NQO1 protein expression and NFκB activation, underlined also by inverse patterns of association with ER and gene expression profiles of tumors, suggests that NQO1-NFκB interaction in breast cancer is different from several other tissue types, possibly due to estrogen receptor signaling in breast cancer. Neither NQO1 nor NFκB protein expression appear as significant prognostic or predictive markers in breast cancer.
KCNJ11 is one of the candidate genes for type 2 diabetes, confirmed by genome wide association study, but there are little data on the relationship between KCNJ11 and impaired glucose regulation in essential hypertension patients. To identify the effect of E23K and I337V in the KCNJ11 gene on susceptibility to impaired glucose regulation, we conducted a case control study in 1125 essential hypertension patients with or without impaired glucose regulation among a Han Chinese population. We also evaluated the impact of two SNPs on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance estimated through an oral glucose tolerance test. In our case control study, no association of E23K and I337V with impaired glucose regulation was found using any genotypic models. However, lysine carriers of E23K showed a significant association with decreased insulin (30 min) and Cederholm index, and valine carriers of I337V showed association with a lower Cederholm index. All the quantitative tests were performed by linear regression, with adjustment for gender, age, body mass index, blood pressure, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker treatment. These findings provided evidence that the KCNJ11 gene plays a role in the pathogenesis of decreased insulin sensitivity in essential hypertension patients.
ABO incompatible bone marrow transplantation (BMT) requires processing of the donated bone marrow (BM), either erythrocyte depletion, or also a volume reduction. The AMICUS™ system was introduced in the field of peripheral blood mononuclear cell collection, showing a good performance regarding efficiency and safety. To evaluate the performance of the MNC collection program of the Amicus device for BM, we analysed our data obtained from the Amicus and the Fenwal CS3000omnix™ plus device.
"ABCA4 is a photoreceptor-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter implicated in the clearance of all-trans-retinal produced in the retina during light perception. Multiple mutations in this protein have been linked to Stargardt disease and other visual disorders. Here we report the first systematic study of posttranslational modifications in native ABCA4 purified from bovine rod outer segments. Seven N-glycosylation sites were detected in exocytoplasmic domains 1 and 2 by mass spectrometry, confirming the topological model of ABCA4 proposed previously. The modifying oligosaccharides were relatively short and homogeneous, predominantly representing a high-mannose type of N-glycosylation. Five phosphorylation sites were detected in cytoplasmic domain 1, with four of them located in the linker ""regulatory-like"" region conserved among ABCA subfamily members. Contrary to published results, phosphorylation of ABCA4 was found to be independent of light. Using human ABCA4 mutants heterologously expressed in mammalian cells, we showed that the Stargardt disease-associated alanine mutation in the phosphorylation site at position 901 led to protein misfolding and degradation. Furthermore, replacing the S1317 phosphorylation site reduced the basal ATPase activity of ABCA4, whereas an alanine mutation in either the S1185 or T1313 phosphorylation site resulted in a significant decrease in the all-trans-retinal-stimulated ATPase activity without affecting the basal activity, protein expression, or localization. In agreement with this observation, partial dephosphorylation of native bovine ABCA4 led to reduction of both basal and stimulated ATPase activity. Thus, we present the first evidence that phosphorylation of ABCA4 can regulate its function."
ABCB11 is a canalicular transport protein that controls the rate-limiting step in hepatic bile acid secretion. Its expression levels vary in humans, and it is not clear how these variations affect lipid metabolism. We investigated whether overexpression of Abcb11 in mice increases lipid absorption in the intestine and affects the development of obesity or hypercholesterolemia.
PTPMT1 (PTP localized to the Mitochondrion 1) is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase superfamily that is localized exclusively to the mitochondrion. We recently reported that PTPMT1 dephosphorylates phosphatidylglycerol phosphate, an essential intermediate of cardiolipin biosynthesis. To gain further insights into the molecular basis of PTPMT1 function, we determined the crystal structures of the phosphatase domain of PTPMT1. PTPMT1 exhibits a canonical protein tyrosine phosphatase domain fold, resembling many dual-specificity phosphatases such as phosphatase and tensin homolog and vaccinia H1-related phosphatase. We also determined the structure of the catalytically inactive phosphatase in complex with a surrogate substrate, phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate, which sheds light on the substrate recognition and specificity of PTPMT1. Comparison of the apo and substrate-bound structures of PTPMT1 suggests that it undergoes significant conformational change during catalysis, and we further demonstrated that an evolutionarily conserved EEYE loop is important for its activity.
CYP2A6 influences smoking uptake in adolescence. Genetic variation in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3 region influences smoking behaviour in adults. However, their combined effects on smoking in adolescence have not been tested to date. We present data on 1450 adolescents from the Ten Towns Heart Health Study (TTHHS) extensively phenotyped for smoking-related traits during adolescence. Single nucleotide polymorphisms from CHRNA5 and CHRNA3 (previously associated with smoking), were typed in our study population, previously genotyped for CYP2A6. Association analyses between each genotype and both smoking status and behavioural markers of smoking were performed. rs16969968 in CHRNA5 was associated both at 13-15 years and 18 years with current smoking amongst adolescents who had tried smoking (OR = 1.82, CI = 1.10-3.01, p = 0.02 at age 13-15; OR = 2.39, CI = 1.37-4.17, p = 0.002 at age 18). No association was found for rs578776 in CHRNA3. The effects of CHRNA5 and CYP2A6 genotypes in TTHHS appeared to be independent, with each approximately doubling the odds of being a regular smoker by age 18 years. CYP2A6 genotype insufficiency increases adolescent likelihood of being a regular smoker but increases later life quitting likelihood and reduces average consumption. In contrast, CHRNA5 genotype, acting recessively, affects smoking similarly in adolescents and older adults. These contrasting actions, in digenic combination, illustrate behavioural genetic complexity.
PAH degrading Pseudomonad and Alcaligenes species were isolated from landfill soil and mine drainage in South Africa. The isolated organisms were mildly radiation tolerant and were able to degrade PAHs in simulated nuclear wastewater. The radiation in the simulated wastewater, at 0.677 Bq/μL, was compatible to measured values in wastewater from a local radioisotope manufacturing facility, and was enough to inhibit metabolic activity of known PAH degraders from soil such as Pseudomonas putida GMP-1. The organic constituents in the original radioactive waste stream consisted of the full range of PAHs except fluoranthene. Among the observed PAHs in the nuclear wastewater from the radioisotope manufacturing facility, acenaphthene and chrysene predominated--measured at 25.1 and 14.2mg/L, respectively. Up to sixteen U.S.EPA priority PAHs were detected at levels higher than allowable limits in drinking water. The biodegradation of the PAHs was limited by the solubility of the compounds. This contributed to the observed faster degradation rates in low molecular weight (LMW) compounds than in high molecular weight compounds.
CD38 is a 42-45 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein that exhibits ADP-ribosyl cyclase enzyme activity. In the rat, we have previously reported strong ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity in the sublingual salivary gland (Masuda W. and Noguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. (2000) 270, 469-472). Here, we have examined the specific localization of CD38/ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity in this gland and whether that localization changes upon saliva-secretary stimulation. Under resting conditions, CD38/ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity in the post-nuclear fraction of SLG homogenates was separated into two major peaks by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The first peak included the plasma membrane proteins Na+/K+ ATPase and aquaporin 5, while the second peak included mucous secretory protein mucin and vesicle-associated membrane protein 2. When rats were subjected to the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine, the CD38/ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity disappeared from the second peak, as did mucin and vesicle-associated membrane protein 2. Pre-treatment of rats with the muscarinic antagonist atropine before pilocarpine administration, or adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol, the sucrose density gradient separation profiles were same as that seen under resting condition. Using an immunofluorescent strategy, we observed the preferential localization of CD38 in the basolateral plasma membrane and intracellular granule-like membrane in sublingual acinar cells under resting conditions.
ABCA1 belongs to the A class of ABC transporter, which is absent in yeast. ABCA1 elicits lipid translocation at the plasma membrane through yet elusive processes. We successfully expressed the mouse Abca1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cloned ABCA1 distributed at the yeast plasma membrane in stable discrete domains that we name MCA (membrane cluster containing ABCA1) and that do not overlap with the previously identified punctate structures MCC (membrane cluster containing Can1p) and MCP (membrane cluster containing Pma1p). By comparison with a nonfunctional mutant, we demonstrated that ABCA1 elicits specific phenotypes in response to compounds known to interact with membrane lipids, such as papuamide B, amphotericin B and pimaricin. The sensitivity of these novel phenotypes to the genetic modification of the membrane lipid composition was studied by the introduction of the cho1 and lcb1-100 mutations involved respectively in phosphatidylserine or sphingolipid biosynthesis in yeast cells. The results, corroborated by the analysis of equivalent mammalian mutant cell lines, demonstrate that membrane composition, in particular its phosphatidylserine content, influences the function of the transporter. We thus have reconstituted in yeast the essential functions associated to the expression of ABCA1 in mammals and characterized new physiological phenotypes prone to genetic analysis. This article is a part of a Special Issue entitled Advances in High Density Lipoprotein Formation and Metabolism: A Tribute to John F. Oram (1945-2010).
PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) is a debilitating and life-threatening disease, often affecting young people. We specifically expressed human MMP-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1) in mouse macrophages and examined its effects in attenuating the decompensating features of MCT (monocrotaline)-induced PAH. Measurement of RV (right ventricular) pressure revealed a 2.5-fold increase after treatment with MCT, which was reduced to 1.5-fold in MMP-1 transgenic mice. There was conspicuous pulmonary inflammation with chronic infiltration of mononuclear cells after the administration of MCT, which was significantly diminished in transgenic mice. Furthermore, transgenic mice showed decreased collagen deposition compared with WT (wild-type). Staining for Mac-3 (macrophage-3) and α-SMA (α-smooth muscle actin) revealed extensive infiltration of macrophages and medial hypertrophy of large pulmonary vessels with complete occlusion of small arteries respectively. These changes were markedly reduced in MMP-1 transgenic mice compared with WT. Western blotting for molecules involved in cell multiplication and proliferation depicted a significant decrease in the lung tissue of transgenic mice after the treatment with MCT. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that transgenic expression of human MMP-1 decreased proliferation of smooth muscle cells and prevented excessive deposition of collagen in the pulmonary arterial tree. Our results indicate that up-regulation of MMP-1 could attenuate the debilitation of human PAH and provide an option for therapeutic intervention.
CYP2D6 is part of the cytochrome P450 system, which catalyzes biotransformation of endogenous substrates and xenobiotics. Approximately 10% of the Caucasian population has two null alleles, resulting in a poor metabolizer (PM) status. Mostly, allele four (CYP2D6*4) is responsible for the PM status, which is suspected to be associated with an accelerated fibrosis progression (FP). The aim of the present study was to analyze the role of the CYP2D6*4 genotype for FP after liver transplantation (LT). Genotypes were determined in liver biopsies (donor) and peripheral blood (recipient) by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Data were correlated with clinical variables and risk factors for fibrosis. We analyzed 517 LTs performed between 1997 and 2009. Overall donor and recipient allele frequencies were comparable (18.0%, 20.5%; P = 0.43). The donor genotype did not correlate with FP. In contrast, recipients carrying CYP2D6*4, showed a significant higher risk for an accelerated FP (P = 0.011) in HCV positive (P = 0.038) and HCV negative patients (P = 0.033). Results were confirmed by multivariate analysis (Hazard ratio 1.65; P = 0.001). The CYP2D6*4-associated PM status of the donor liver seems to have no influence on FP after LT. Recipients, carrying the allele, have an elevated risk for an accelerated FP.
SPR based biosensors register binding of analytes to the surface with immobilized receptors by measuring changes of the refractive index near this surface. An important task in the improvement of this measurement technology is a separation of signals, corresponding to the changes in the chemosensitive layer, from undesired contributions of bulk phase, for example, due to fluctuations of temperature, concentrations of solutes, pressure. The wavelength of the incident light influences strongly the penetration depth of the corresponding evanescent wave. This dependence was exploited here for compensation of the contribution of the bulk refractive index. It was performed using differential SPR measurements at two wavelengths with differing penetration depths. Theoretical analysis and numerical optimization of the suggested approach, named a Penetration Difference Self-Referencing SPR (PDSR-SPR), were performed. Experimental test was performed using 658 and 980 nm laser diodes. Over 20 times suppression of variations of bulk refractive index with magnitude up to 1000 μRIU was observed. Finally, PDSR-SPR approach was applied for monitoring of antibodies binding to the immobilized antigens.
PIK3CA gain-of-function mutations are a common oncogenic event in human malignancy, making phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) a target for cancer therapy. Despite the promise of targeted therapy, resistance often develops, leading to treatment failure. To elucidate mechanisms of resistance to PI3K-targeted therapy, we constructed a mouse model of breast cancer conditionally expressing human PIK3CA(H1047R). Notably, most PIK3CA(H1047R)-driven mammary tumors recurred after PIK3CA(H1047R) inactivation. Genomic analyses of recurrent tumors revealed multiple lesions, including focal amplification of Met or Myc (also known as c-Met and c-Myc, respectively). Whereas Met amplification led to tumor survival dependent on activation of endogenous PI3K, tumors with Myc amplification became independent of the PI3K pathway. Functional analyses showed that Myc contributed to oncogene independence and resistance to PI3K inhibition. Notably, PIK3CA mutations and c-MYC elevation co-occur in a substantial fraction of human breast tumors. Together, these data suggest that c-MYC elevation represents a potential mechanism by which tumors develop resistance to current PI3K-targeted therapies.
PIK3CA mutations in the helical domain (in exon 9) and in the kinase domain (exon 20) cause tumor formation by different means. We aimed to determine the effects of each of these mutations on survival of colon carcinoma patients.
GK (glucokinase) is activated by glucose binding to its substrate site, is inhibited by GKRP (GK regulatory protein) and stimulated by GKAs (GK activator drugs). To explore further the mechanisms of these processes we studied pure recombinant human GK (normal enzyme and a selection of 31 mutants) using steady-state kinetics of the enzyme and TF (tryptophan fluorescence). TF studies of the normal binary GK-glucose complex corroborate recent crystallography studies showing that it exists in a closed conformation greatly different from the open conformation of the ligand-free structure, but indistinguishable from the ternary GK-glucose-GKA complex. GKAs did activate and GKRP did inhibit normal GK, whereas its TF was doubled by glucose saturation. However, the enzyme kinetics, GKRP inhibition, TF enhancement by glucose and responsiveness to GKA of the selected mutants varied greatly. Two predominant response patterns were identified accounting for nearly all mutants: (i) GK mutants with a normal or close to normal response to GKA, normally low basal TF (indicating an open conformation), some variability of kinetic parameters (k(cat), glucose S(0.5), h and ATP K(m)), but usually strong GKRP inhibition (13/31); and (ii) GK mutants that are refractory to GKAs, exhibit relatively high basal TF (indicating structural compaction and partial closure), usually show strongly enhanced catalytic activity primarily due to lowering of the glucose S(0.5), but with reduced or no GKRP inhibition in most cases (14/31). These results and those of previous studies are best explained by envisioning a common allosteric regulator region with spatially non-overlapping GKRP- and GKA-binding sites.
CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is a cAMP-regulated chloride (Cl(-)) channel that plays an important role in salt and fluid movement across epithelia. Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common genetic disease among Caucasians, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding CFTR. The most predominant mutation, F508del, disturbs CFTR protein trafficking, resulting in a reduced number of CFTR in the plasma membrane. Recent studies indicate that CFTR is not only found in epithelia but also in human erythrocytes. Although considerable attempts have been made to quantify CFTR in cells, conclusions on numbers of CFTR molecules localized in the plasma membrane have been drawn indirectly. AFM has the power to provide the needed information, since both sub-molecular spatial resolution and direct protein recognition via antibody-antigen interaction can be observed. We performed a quantification study of the CFTR copies in erythrocyte membranes at the single molecule level, and compared the difference between healthy donors and CF patients. We detected that the number of CFTR molecules is reduced by 70% in erythrocytes of cystic fibrosis patients.
ABCA1 is a key element of cellular cholesterol homeostasis. ApoE K/O mice fed with high-fat diet were infused with anti-ABCA1 antibody or control IgM. Infusion of anti-ABCA1 antibody led to 72% increase in the area of atherosclerotic plaque in aorta. After 16 weeks on high-fat diet plasma level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was reduced in control group, but was unchanged in mice infused with anti-ABCA1 antibody. Total plasma cholesterol level was elevated while the capacity of plasma to support cholesterol efflux ex vivo was reduced after 16 weeks on high-fat diet; the effects were similar in the two groups. We conclude that functional blocking of ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux stimulates development of atherosclerosis in apoE K/O mice independently from HDL-C levels.
CYP2C9 enzyme metabolizes numerous clinically important drugs. The aim of this study is to investigate the frequencies of CYP2C9 genotypes and the effects of selected alleles on losartan pharmacokinetics in a large sample of the Korean population.
EHMT2 is a histone lysine methyltransferase localized in euchromatin regions and acting as a corepressor for specific transcription factors. Although the role of EHMT2 in transcriptional regulation has been well documented, the pathologic consequences of its dysfunction in human disease have not been well understood. Here, we describe important roles of EHMT2 in human carcinogenesis. Expression levels of EHMT2 are significantly elevated in human bladder carcinomas compared with nonneoplastic bladder tissues (P < .0001) in real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Complementary DNA microarray analysis also revealed its overexpression in various types of cancer. The reduction of EHMT2 expression by small interfering RNAs resulted in the suppression of the growth of cancer cells and possibly caused apoptotic cell death in cancer cells. Importantly, we show that EHMT2 can suppress transcription of the SIAH1 gene by binding to its promoter region (-293 to +51) and by methylating lysine 9 of histone H3. Furthermore, an EHMT2-specific inhibitor, BIX-01294, significantly suppressed the growth of cancer cells. Our results suggest that dysregulation of EHMT2 plays an important role in the growth regulation of cancer cells, and further functional studies may affirm the importance of EHMT2 as a promising therapeutic target for various types of cancer.
ABCB6 is a mitochondrial transporter that regulates porphyrin biosynthesis. ABCB6 expression is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but the significance of this upregulation to HCC is not known. In the present study, we investigated: 1) ABCB6 expression in 18 resected human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and 3 human hepatoma cell lines; 2) pattern of ABCB6 expression during liver disease progression; and 3) functional significance of ABCB6 expression to HCC using the hepatoma cell line Huh7. ABCB6 expression was determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. ABCB6 expression was upregulated in all the HCC specimens and the three-hepatoma cell lines. Increased ABCB6 expression correlated with liver disease progression with the pattern of expression being HCC > cirrhosis > steatosis. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of ABCB6 in Huh7 cells lead to decreased cellular proliferation and colony formation. Attenuation of ABCB6 expression did not affect Huh7 apoptosis but lead to a delay in G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, ABCB6 overexpression resulted in increased growth and proliferation of Huh7 cells. Since ABCB6 expression is induced in multiple tumor types we explored the role of ABCB6 in other cancer cells. ShRNA mediated knockdown of ABCB6 in HEK293 and K562 cells reduced cellular proliferation leading to a delay in G2/M phase, while ABCB6 overexpression promoted cell growth and proliferation. Collectively, these findings, obtained by loss of function and gain of function analysis, suggest that ABCB6 plays a role in cell growth and proliferation by targeting the cell cycle.
ATP1B4 genes represent a rare instance of the orthologous gene co-option that radically changed functions of encoded BetaM proteins during vertebrate evolution. In lower vertebrates, this protein is a β-subunit of Na,K-ATPase located in the cell membrane. In placental mammals, BetaM completely lost its ancestral role and through acquisition of two extended Glu-rich clusters into the N-terminal domain gained entirely new properties as a muscle-specific protein of the inner nuclear membrane possessing the ability to regulate gene expression. Strict temporal regulation of BetaM expression, which is the highest in late fetal and early postnatal myocytes, indicates that it plays an essential role in perinatal development. Here we report the first structural characterization of the native eutherian BetaM protein. It should be noted that, in contrast to structurally related Na,K-ATPase β-subunits, the polypeptide chain of BetaM is highly sensitive to endogenous proteases that greatly complicated its isolation. Nevertheless, using a complex of protease inhibitors, a sample of authentic BetaM was isolated from pig neonatal skeletal muscle by a combination of ion-exchange and lectin-affinity chromatography followed by SDS-PAGE. Results of the analysis of the BetaM tryptic digest using MALDI-TOF and ESI-MS/MS mass spectrometry have demonstrated that native BetaM in neonatal skeletal muscle is a product of alternative splice mRNA variant B and comprised of 351 amino acid residues. Isolated BetaM protein was also characterized by SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry before and after deglycosylation. This allowed us to determine that the carbohydrate moiety of BetaM has molecular mass 5.9kDa and consists of short high-mannose type N-glycans. The results of direct analysis of the purified native eutherian BetaM protein provide first insights into structural properties underlying its entirely new evolutionarily acquired functions.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) proteins are dual phosphatases with both protein and phosphoinositide phosphatase activity. They modulate signalling pathways controlling growth, metabolism and apoptosis in animals and are implied in several human diseases. In the present paper we describe a novel class of PTEN pro-teins in plants, termed PTEN2, which comprises the AtPTEN (Arabidopsis PTEN) 2a and AtPTEN2b proteins in Arabidopsis. Both display low in vitro tyrosine phosphatase activity. In addition, AtPTEN2a actively dephosphorylates in vitro the 3' phosphate group of PI3P (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate), PI(3,4)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate) and PI(3,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate). In contrast with animal PTENs, PI(3,4,5)P3 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate) is a poor substrate. Site-directed mutagenesis of AtPTEN2a and molecular modelling of protein-phosphoinositide interactions indicated that substitutions at the PTEN2 core catalytic site of the Lys267 and Gly268 residues found in animals, which are critical for animal PTEN activity, by Met267 and Ala268 found in the eudicot PTEN2 are responsible for changes in substrate specificity. Remarkably, the AtPTEN2a protein also displays strong binding activity for PA (phosphatidic acid), a major lipid second messenger in plants. Promoter::GUS (β-glucuronidase) fusion, transcript and protein analyses further showed the transcriptional regulation of the ubiquitously expressed AtPTEN2a and AtPTEN2b by salt and osmotic stress. The results of the present study suggest a function for this novel class of plant PTEN proteins as an effector of lipid signalling in plants.
KCNJ11 gene mutations are related to permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM). Glycemic stability minimizes the risk of complications. Sulfonylureas (SU) are the proven best therapeutic option. We report a 18-month follow-up of switching from insulin to SU in a mother and her daughter with PNDM due to KCNJ11 mutation.
IDH1 SNP rs11554137 was recently reported in association with poor prognosis in normal karyotype adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We aimed to determine the prevalence, clinical associations, and prognostic significance of SNP rs11554137 in unselected pediatric and adult AML patients. Diagnostic marrow specimens from 527 AML patients treated on the pediatric trial Children's Oncology Group-AAML03P1 (N = 253) or adult SWOG trials (N = 274) were analyzed for the presence of the SNP. SNP rs11554137 was present in 11% of all patients. SNP status had no prognostic impact on survival in pediatric patients. In adult AML, overall survival for SNP-positive patients was 10% versus 18% for SNP-negative patients (P = .44). Among the 142 adults who achieved complete remission, 5-year relapse-free survival was significantly worse for SNP-positive patients (0% vs 25%, P = .0014). However, among adults with normal cytogenetics, FLT3/ITD was present in 90% of SNP-positive patients versus 59% of SNP-negative patients (P = .0053). In multivariate analysis, adjusting for the effects of age, cytogenetics, and FLT3/ITD, the independent prognostic effect of SNP positivity was not statistically significant (hazard ratio = 1.72, P = .18). The clinical profile of SNP-positive patients suggests that SNP rs11554137 may have biologic effects that bear further investigation. The clinical trials in this study are registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT000707174 and #NCT00899171.
UGT2B7 is a key member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family that participates in glucuronidation of endogenous compounds and pharmaceuticals. Much evidence suggests a large interindividual variability of UGT2B7-mediated glucuronidation, which is still unexplained by polymorphisms. We hypothesized that alternative splicing may be responsible for the variability in the UGT2B7 function.
CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms contribute to marked interindividual differences in the metabolism of and response to tacrolimus in humans.
NEU3 is a membrane sialidase specific for gangliosides. Its increased expression and implication in some cancers have been reported. Here, we analyzed NEU3 expression in malignant melanoma cell lines and its roles in the cancer phenotypes. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that high levels of the NEU3 gene were expressed at almost equivalent levels with those in colon cancers. To examine the effects of overexpression of NEU3, NEU3 cDNA-transfectant cells were established using a melanoma cell line SK-MEL-28 and its mutant N1 lacking GD3. SK-MEL-28 sublines overexpressing both the NEU3 gene and NEU3 enzyme activity showed no changes in both cell growth and ganglioside expression, while N1 cells showed a mild increase in cell proliferation with increased phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and neo-synthesis of Gb3 after NEU3 transfection. In contrast, NEU3 silencing resulted in a definite reduction in cell growth in a melanoma line MeWo, while ganglioside patterns underwent minimal changes. Phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 with serum stimulation decreased in the NEU3-silenced cells. All these results suggest that NEU3 is highly expressed to enhance malignant phenotypes including apoptosis inhibition in malignant melanomas.
CD38 is a 45 kDa transmembrane receptor expressed in B lymphocytes and other cells from the immune system. It is involved in apoptosis, cell activation, differentiation, and proliferation. CD38 has been used extensively to classify various subpopulations of lymphocytes in both humans and mice. It has also been used as a marker of poor prognosis in some lymphoid pathologies. However, CD38 is not a marker but rather an ectoenzyme and a receptor, where it performs several functions. The CD38 signaling pathway has only been partially studied in various cells of the immune system, where apparently the signaling is different depending on the lineage and differentiation state of the cell, leading to distinct outcomes. In this review, we provide an overview of well-established roles of CD38 signaling B lymphocytes from mice. We also discuss areas that need further clarification to get a broader image of how CD38 performs different functions in B cells and to understand its role in B lymphocyte biology under normal versus pathological conditions.
CYP3A4 is involved in the oxidative metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics including the immunosuppressants tacrolimus (Tac) and cyclosporine (CsA). The objective of the study was to assess the potential influence of a new functional SNP in CYP3A4 on the pharmacokinetic parameters assessed by dose requirements and trough blood levels of both calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) in stable renal transplant patients.
NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinoneoxidoreductase 1) is a reductive enzyme that is an important activator of bioreductive antitumor agents. NQO1 activity varies in individual tumors but is generally higher in tumor cells than in normal cells. NQO1 has been used as a target for tumor specific drug development. We investigated a series of bioreductive benzoquinone mustard analogs as a model for NQO1 targeted individualized cancer chemotherapy. We compared the tumor cell growth inhibitory activity of benzoquinone mustard analogs with sterically bulky groups of different size and placed at different positions on the benzoquinone ring, using tumor cell lines with different levels of NQO1. We demonstrated that functional groups of different steric size could be used to produce a series of bioreductive antitumor agents that were activated by different levels of NQO1 in tumor cells. This series of drugs could then be used to target cells with specific levels of NQO1 for growth inhibition and to avoid damage to normal cells, like bone marrow cells, that have low levels of NQO1. This approach could be used to develop new bioreductive antitumor agents for NQO1 targeted individualized cancer chemotherapy.
AQP3 is a water/glycerol transporter expressed at the basolateral membrane of colonic epithelial cells. Although AQPs are expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, their effect on intestinal barrier has not been clear. Here, we showed that knockdown of AQP3 caused a dramatic, dose-dependent increase in E. coli C25 translocation, with the reduction of TEER and increasing LY permeability. Western blots revealed that expression of Claudin-1 and Occludin were significantly decreased in the AQP3 knockdown group, demonstrating that this treatment enhances paracellular permeability via an opening of the tight junction complex. These data not only describe the correlation between transcellular and paracellular pathways in human intestines, but also show that targeted knockdown of AQP3 might impair the intestinal barrier integrity.
CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) are present in the human intestine and mediate intestinal first-pass metabolism and the efflux of oral drugs, respectively. We aimed to predict whether intestinal CYP3A4/P-gp is saturated in a therapeutic dose range.
SLC2A2 encoding glucose transporter -2 (GLUT2) acts as the primary glucose transporter and sensor in rodent pancreatic islets and is widely assumed to play a similar role in humans. In healthy adults SLC2A2 variants are associated with elevated fasting plasma glucose (fpg) concentrations but physiological characterisation does not support a defect in pancreatic beta-cell function. Interspecies differences can create barriers for the follow up of disease association signals. We hypothesised that GLUT2 is not the principal glucose transporter in human beta-cells and that SLC2A2 variants exert their effect on fpg levels through defects in other tissues. SLC2A1-4 (GLUT 1-4) mRNA expression levels were determined in human and mouse islets, beta-cells, liver, muscle and adipose tissue by qRT-PCR whilst GLUT1-3 protein levels were examined by immunohistochemistry. The presence of all three glucose transporters was demonstrated in human and mouse islets and purified beta-cells. Quantitative expression profiling demonstrated that Slc2a2 is the predominant glucose transporter (expression >10 fold higher that Slc2a1) in mouse islets whilst SLC2A1 and SLC2A3 predominate in both human islets and beta-cells (expression 2.8 and 2.7 fold higher than SLC2A2 respectively). Our data therefore suggest that GLUT2 is unlikely to be the principal glucose transporter in human beta-cells and that SLC2A2 defects in other metabolic tissues drive the observed differences in glucose levels between carriers of SLC2A2 variants. Direct extrapolation from rodent to human islet glucose transporter activity is unlikely to be appropriate.
ENPP1 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1) is an established regulator of tissue mineralization. Previous studies demonstrated that ENPP1 is expressed in differentiated osteoblasts and that ENPP1 influences matrix mineralization by increasing extracellular levels of inorganic pyrophosphate. ENPP1 is also expressed in osteoblastic precursor cells when stimulated with FGF2, but the role of ENPP1 in preosteoblastic and other precursor cells is unknown. Here we investigate the function of ENPP1 in preosteoblasts. We find that ENPP1 expression is critical for osteoblastic differentiation and that this effect is not mediated by changes in extracellular concentration levels of phosphate or pyrophosphate or ENPP1 catalytic activity. MC3T3E1(C4) preosteoblastic cells, in which ENPP1 expression was suppressed by ENPP1-specific shRNA, and calvarial cells isolated from Enpp1 knock-out mice show defective osteoblastic differentiation upon stimulation with ascorbate, as indicated by a lack of cellular morphological change, a lack of osteoblast marker gene expression, and an inability to mineralize matrix. Additionally, MC3T3E1(C4) cells, in which wild type or catalytic inactive ENPP1 expression was increased, exhibited an increased tendency to differentiate, as evidenced by increased osteoblast marker gene expression and increased mineralization. Notably, treatment of cells with inorganic phosphate or pyrophosphate inhibited, as opposed to enhanced, expression of multiple genes that are expressed in association with osteoblast differentiation, matrix deposition, and mineralization. Our results indicate that ENPP1 plays multiple and distinct roles in the development of mineralized tissues and that the influence of ENPP1 on osteoblast differentiation and gene expression may include a mechanism that is independent of its catalytic activity.
CYP2C19 is a polymorphic enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of 10% of clinically used drugs worldwide. The CYP2C19*3 allele is characterized by a premature stop codon that leads to a truncated nonfunctional protein and consequently a poor metabolizer phenotype. Aminoglycoside antibiotics have been shown to induce readthrough of premature stop codons and partial restoration of protein function. We investigated the ability of the aminoglycosides gentamicin and G418 to induce readthrough of CYP2C19*3 premature stop codon in human cells.
CYP3A4 is the major cytochrome in humans which shows reduced activity in chronic liver disease as well as in hepatic cirrhosis. The detection of this polymorphism may give an indication on the prognosis of patients having chronic viral hepatitis with superimposed hepatitis A infection. The aim of this study is to correlate the seroprevalence of anti-HAV antibodies in chronic liver disease patients having CYP3A4*18 polymorphisms.
ABCG2 is an ABC transporter. It has been demonstrated that endogenous ABCG2 expression in certain cancers is a possible reflection of the differentiated phenotype of the cell of origin and likely contributes to intrinsic drug resistance. But little is known about the contribution of ABCG2 to the drug resistance and the clinicopathological characteristics in breast cancer. In the present study, we investigated the expression of ABCG2 and the correlations between ABCG2 expression and patients' clinicopathological and biological characteristics.
CYP3A4 is involved in the oxidative metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics including the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin. The objective of this study was to investigate whether a new CYP3A4 functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron 6 (CYP3A4*22) modifies the effect of simvastatin on total cholesterol (TOTc) or LDL cholesterol (LDLc) reduction in a population-based cohort study.
CYP2D6 is a key enzyme responsible for the metabolism of tamoxifen to active metabolites, endoxifen, and 4-hydroxytamoxifen. The breast cancer patients who are heterozygous and homozygous for decreased-function and null alleles of CYP2D6 showed lower plasma concentrations of endoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen compared to patients with homozygous-wild-type allele, resulting in worse clinical outcome in tamoxifen therapy. We recruited 98 Japanese breast cancer patients, who had been taking 20 mg of tamoxifen daily as adjuvant setting. For the patients who have one or no normal allele of CYP2D6, dosages of tamoxifen were increased to 30 and 40 mg/day, respectively. The plasma concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites were measured at 8 weeks after dose-adjustment using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Association between tamoxifen dose and the incidence of adverse events during the tamoxifen treatment was investigated. In the patients with CYP2D6*1/*10 and CYP2D6*10/*10, the mean plasma endoxifen levels after dose increase were 1.4- and 1.7-fold higher, respectively, than those before the increase (P < 0.001). These plasma concentrations of endoxifen achieved similar level of those in the CYP2D6*1/*1 patients receiving 20 mg/day of tamoxifen. Plasma 4-hydroxytamoxifen concentrations in the patients with CYP2D6*1/*10 and CYP2D6*10/*10 were also significantly increased to the similar levels of the CYP2D6*1/*1 patients according to the increasing tamoxifen dosages (P < 0.001). The incidence of adverse events was not significantly different between before and after dose adjustment. This study provides the evidence that dose adjustment is useful for the patients carrying CYP2D6*10 allele to maintain the effective endoxifen level.
CD36 is the major receptor mediating nonopsonic phagocytosis of Plasmodium falciparum-parasitized erythrocytes by macrophages. Its expression on macrophages is mainly controlled by the nuclear receptor PPARγ. Here, we demonstrate that inflammatory processes negatively regulate CD36 expression on human and murine macrophages, and hence decrease Plasmodium clearance directly favoring the worsening of malaria infection. This CD36 downregulation in inflammatory conditions is associated with a failure in the expression and activation of PPARγ. Interestingly, using siRNA mediating knock down of Nrf2 in macrophages or Nrf2- and PPARγ-deficient macrophages, we establish that in inflammatory conditions, the Nrf2 transcription factor controls CD36 expression independently of PPARγ. In these conditions, Nrf2 activators, but not PPARγ ligands, enhance CD36 expression and CD36-mediated Plasmodium phagocytosis. These results were confirmed in human macrophages and in vivo where only Nrf2 activators improve the outcome of severe malaria. Collectively, this report highlights that the Nrf2 transcription factor could be an alternative target to PPARγ in the control of severe malaria through parasite clearance.
SCD has been reported to involve the inner ear and result in LH and LO. Our purpose was to examine the prevalence of inner ear involvement and to assess the relationship between clinical and imaging findings in patients with SCD.
CYP3A4 is involved in tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug metabolism. Transcriptional activation by rifampicin involves the CYP3A4 gene 5'-upstream region. Consequently, variation may interfere with transcription and enzymatic activity and even drug response. However, genetic polymorphisms and distribution of CYP3A4 allelic frequencies in individuals from Rio de Janeiro remain unknown. The aim of this study was to conduct research into sequencing the CYP3A4 5'-upstream region in Brazilian patients with and without HIV. This follow-up study involved 106 individuals undergoing treatment for TB and/or HIV. The CYP3A4 5'-upstream region was analyzed using PCR, sequencing and clinical data. Male patients revealed a higher HIV frequency (p=0.021). The TB forms observed were pulmonary (48.1%), extrapulmonary (22.64%) and disseminated (27.36%). Lymph node form was the most frequent (70.83%) extrapulmonary form of TB. The only single nucleotide polymorphism detected in the population was c.-392A>G. Genotypes observed were CYP3A4*1A/CYP3A4*1A (45.3%), CYP3A4*1A/CYP3A4*1B (40.6%) and CYP3A4*1B/CYP3A4*1B (14.2%), revealing a different distribution with extrapulmonary TB cases (17.6% CYP3A4*1A/CYP3A4*1B and 23.5% CYP3A4*1B/CYP3A4*1B). The CYP3A4*1A allele was found to be associated with tobacco use. The CYP3A4*1B mutant allele occurred in 34% of patients. This study revealed that the CYP3A4 5'-upstream regulatory region was highly conserved with the exception of the -392 position. Genotype association with tobacco suggests that CYP3A4 may participate in tobacco metabolism. Genotype distribution inversion in extrapulmonary TB cases suggests that CYP3A4 may be involved in TB prognosis.
CYP2S1 is an evolutionarily conserved, mainly extra-hepatic member of the CYP2 family and proposed to be regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR).        The present study explores AhR's regulation of CYP2S1 in male Sprague Dawley rats using PCB126 (3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl), the most potent AhR agonist among the PCBs. Additionally, CYP2S1 expression was examined after treatments with the classic CYP-inducers β-naphthoflavone (β-NF, AhR activator), phenobarbital (PB, CAR activator) and dexamethasone (Dex, PXR activator). CYP2S1 and CYP1A1/2, CYP1B1, CYP2B and CYP3A mRNAs were measured in liver, lung, spleen, stomach, kidney, and thymus at different time points.        Constitutive CYP2S1 was expressed at comparable levels to other CYPs with the highest expression levels in stomach, kidney and lung. CYP2S1 mRNA was only non-significantly elevated by β-NF in liver tissues. PCB126 did not increase CYP2S1 mRNA in any organ and at any time point examined despite a significant induction of CYP1 genes. PCB126 reduced CYP2S1 mRNA by 40% (not significant) from the 7th post-exposure day in thymus. PB and Dex had no effect on CYP2S1 mRNA levels.        These observations show that in this model CYP2S1 is not, or only weakly, regulated by AhR and not induced by CAR or PXR activators.
ABCG2 is one of three human ATP binding cassette transporters that are functionally capable of exporting a diverse range of substrates from cells. The physiological consequence of ABCG2 multidrug transport activity in leukaemia, and some solid tumours is the acquisition of cancer multidrug resistance. ABCG2 has a primary structure that infers that a minimal functional transporting unit would be a homodimer. Here we investigated the ability of a bimolecular fluorescence complementation approach to examine ABCG2 dimers, and to probe the role of individual amino acid substitutions in dimer formation. ABCG2 was tagged with fragments of venus fluorescent protein (vYFP), and this tagging did not perturb trafficking or function. Co-expression of two proteins bearing N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of YFP resulted in their association and detection of dimerization by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Point mutations in ABCG2 which may affect dimer formation were examined for alterations in the magnitude of fluorescence complementation signal. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) demonstrated specific ABCG2 dimer formation, but no changes in dimer formation, resulting from single amino acid substitutions, were detected by BiFC analysis.
CD38 is a multifunctional protein involving in a number of signalling pathways. Given that the lack of CD38 is considered as a dedifferentiation marker of lymphocytes and other cells, we hypothesized that CD38 and its signalling pathway may participate in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of podocytes and thereby regulates the integrity of glomerular structure and function. Western blot analysis and RT-PCR demonstrated that renal tissue CD38 expression was lacking in CD38(-/-)  mice or substantially reduced in renal CD38 shRNA-transfected WT (CD38-shRNA) mice compared to CD38(+/+)  littermates. Confocal fluorescent microscopy demonstrated the reduced expression of epithelial markers (P-Cadherin, ZO-1 and podocin) and increased expression of mesenchymal markers (FSP-1, α-SMA and desmin) in the glomeruli of CD38(-/-)  and CD38-shRNA mice compared to CD38(+/+)  mice. Morphological examinations showed profound injury in the glomeruli of CD38(-/-)  or CD38-shRNA mice compared to CD38(+/+)  mice. This enhanced glomerular injury in CD38(-/-)  or CD38-shRNA mice was accompanied by increased albuminuria and proteinuria. DOCA/high salt treatment further decreased the expression of epithelial markers and increased the abundance of mesenchymal markers, which were accompanied by more increased glomerular damage index and mean arterial pressure in CD38(-/-)  and CD38-shRNA mice than CD38(+/+)  mice. In vitro studies showed that inhibition of CD38 enhances the EMT in podocytes. In conclusion, our observations reveal that the normal expression of CD38 importantly contributes to the differentiation and function of podocytes and the defect of this gene expression may be a critical mechanism inducing EMT and consequently resulting in glomerular injury and sclerosis.
CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is expressed in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Cell-surface CFTR levels are regulated by endocytosis and recycling. A number of adaptor proteins including AP-2 (μ2 subunit) and Dab2 (Disabled-2) have been proposed to modulate CFTR internalization. In the present study we have used siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated silencing of these adaptors to test their roles in the regulation of CFTR cell-surface trafficking and stability in human airway epithelial cells. The results indicate that μ2 and Dab2 performed partially overlapping, but divergent, functions. While μ2 depletion dramatically decreased CFTR endocytosis with little effect on the half-life of the CFTR protein, Dab2 depletion increased the CFTR half-life ~3-fold, in addition to inhibiting CFTR endocytosis. Furthermore, Dab2 depletion inhibited CFTR trafficking from the sorting endosome to the recycling compartment, as well as delivery of CFTR to the late endosome, thus providing a mechanistic explanation for increased CFTR expression and half-life. To test whether two E3 ligases were required for the endocytosis and/or down-regulation of surface CFTR, we siRNA-depleted CHIP [C-terminus of the Hsc (heat-shock cognate) 70-interacting protein] and c-Cbl (casitas B-lineage lymphoma). We demonstrate that CHIP and c-Cbl depletion have no effect on CFTR endocytosis, but c-Cbl depletion modestly enhanced the half-life of CFTR. The results of the present study define a significant role for Dab2 both in the endocytosis and post-endocytic fate of CFTR.
SLCO1B3 is an influx transporter located at the hepatocyte basolateral membrane and it is involved in the uptake of a broad range of drug substrates including docetaxel. The pharmacogenetics of SLCO1B3 is not well characterized and previous in vivo and in vitro studies reported conflicting results with regards to the functional effects of the limited number of SLCO1B3 polymorphisms that were studied. Docetaxel displays a wide interindividual variability in its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and an understanding of SLCO1B3 pharmacogenetics might provide clinical benefits in guiding docetaxel dosing.
DHCR24 encodes 3β-hydroxysteroid-Δ24 reductase, catalyzing the conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol. Our previous study demonstrated that DHCR24 exerts an anti-apoptotic function as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, for which it needs its FAD-binding domain. The membrane topology of DHCR24 on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the functional significance of its FAD-binding domain are not completely understood. Based on the structure predicted by bioinformatics, we studied the membrane topology of DHCR24 in murine neuroblastoma cells (N2A), using the fluorescent protease protection (FPP) technique. We showed that full-length DHCR24 is localized to the membrane of ER, whereas the predicted transmembrane (TM) domain-deleted DHCR24 mutation is localized to the cytoplasm. The change of DHCR24 localization suggests that the N-terminal TM domain is essential for the ER membrane targeting of DHCR24. The FPP assay demonstrated the membrane topology of DHCR24 with an N-terminal luminal/C-terminal cytoplasmic orientation. Measurement of intracellular ROS using H(2)DCFDA revealed that the ROS levels of cells infected by plasmids driving expression of full-length DHCR24 or the TM domain-deleted DHCR24 mutation after H(2)O(2) exposure were lower than those of control cells, suggesting that the ER membrane targeting of DHCR24 is not required for its enzymatic ROS scavenging activity. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that the DHCR24-overexpressed cells were protected from apoptosis in response to oxidative stress, which was accompanied by a decrease in DHCR24 content on the ER and activation of caspase-3, suggesting that the anti-apoptotic function of DHCR24 is associated with its cleavage by caspase.
SULT1A1 is involved in both detoxification of estrogens and bioactivation of carcinogens in smoked meat. SULT1A1 Arg213His polymorphism's effect on breast cancer risk is still unclear. We recruited 400 case-control pairs to investigate the association between SULT1A1 genotypes and breast cancer risk, and the combined effect of SULT1A1 polymorphism and daily intake of smoked meat. Participants were questioned about their dietary habits and other risk factors, and their SULT1A1 genotypes were determined. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by multivariable unconditional logistic regression. We also performed a meta-analysis of relevant published studies to test these associations. In the case-control study, no significant associations were observed between SULT1A1 polymorphism and breast cancer risk. In the meta-analysis, SULT1A1 His/His genotype slightly increased risk among both overall and postmenopausal women (OR(pooled-overall)=1.12, 95% CI: 1.02-1.24; OR(pooled-post)=1.17, 95% CI: 1.03-1.32). A larger positive association was observed in Asian populations (OR(pooled-Asian)=2.01, 95% CI: 1.24-3.26). In our case-control study, high energy-adjusted daily intake of smoked meat was significantly associated with breast cancer risk in overall, pre- and postmenopausal women (aORs: 2.31-3.13, OR 95% CIs exclude 1). High smoked meat intake interacted positively with the His variant allele (all γ>1). These results correlated with those of the meta-analysis (γ(pooled-overall)=1.27). The SULT1A1 His/His genotype may increase the risk of breast cancer among Asian women, and dietary exposure to heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, along with the SULT1A1 His/His variant genotype, may synergistically increase the risk of breast cancer.
IDH1 and IDH2 gene mutations are novel, recurring molecular aberrations among patients with normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
ABCA1 protects against atherosclerosis by facilitating cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells in the arterial wall to extracellular apolipoprotein (apo) A-I. In contrast to apoA-I, apoE is secreted by macrophages and can, like apoA-I, induce ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Yet, the combined effect of macrophage ABCA1 and apoE on lesion development is unexplored.
FUT2 encodes the α(1,2) fucosyltransferase that determines blood group secretor status. Homozygotes (A/A) for the common nonsense mutation rs601338A>G (W143X) are nonsecretors and are unable to express histo-blood group antigens in secretions and on mucosal surfaces. This mutation has been reported to provide resistance to Norovirus and susceptibility to Crohn's disease, and hence we aimed to determine if it also affects risk of type 1 diabetes.
ABCC2 contributes to the active cellular efflux of several endogenous and exogenous compounds. The 4544G>A (rs8187710) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which is coding for a C1515Y substitution, has been previously associated with susceptibility to cholestatic liver disease, doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, decreased graft function after renal transplantation and tenofovir-induced proximal nephropathy. It is also involved in differential flavopiridol disposition and increased lopinavir (LPV) cellular accumulation in vivo. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the 4544G>A SNP causes alterations in ABCC2-mediated transport towards different substrates and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.
ABO compatibility creates a disadvantage for O and B renal allograft candidates. A2 ABO incompatible transplant may decrease waiting times and generate equivalent graft survival to an ABO compatible transplant.
ABO blood type has been associated with risk of several malignancies. However, results are not consistent. In this population-based case-control study including 1204 incident endometrial cancer cases and 1212 population controls, we examined the association of self-reported serologic blood type with endometrial cancer risk using a logistic regression model. Women with endometrial cancer were more likely to have blood type A. Compared to women with blood type O, the adjusted odds ratios for endometrial cancer were 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.79-1.28] for type B, 1.24 (95% CI, 0.90-1.69) for type AB, and 1.50 (95% CI, 1.19-1.90) for type A. A significant dose-response relationship was observed for cancer risk and level of antigen A (P for trend = 0.0003). The positive association of blood type A with cancer risk was observed regardless of menopausal status, body mass index, oral contraceptive use, or family cancer history. Our results suggest that ABO blood type may be involved in the development of endometrial cancer.
CYP2S1 is an extrahepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) that shows marked individuality in constitutive and inducible expression. CYP2S1 mRNA expression is increased in psoriasis and by treatments for psoriasis, including retinoids and UV radiation, although endogenous substrates remain poorly characterized. Because previous model systems have overexpressed modified CYP2S1 in bacteria, human HaCaT keratinocyte cells were screened for constitutive and regulatable CYP2S1 expression and CYP2S1 activity in HaCaT cells compared with a novel Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-based cell line engineered to stably coexpress CYP2S1 and NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase. Constitutive mRNA expression for CYP2S1 and additional P450s, retinoid acid receptors (RARα, RARβ, RARγ), and retinoid X receptors (RXRα, RXRβ and RXRγ) was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis in HaCaT cells. Cells were then exposed to retinoids or to UV radiation (UVR), and changes in CYP2S1 mRNA abundance were further examined by qRT-PCR analysis. P450 expression in HaCaT cells was similar to human skin, with abundant CYP2S1 expression. RARα and RARγ (but not RARβ) and all RXR isoforms were also detectable. All-trans retinoic acid (atRA) induced CYPS1 mRNA expression more potently than 9-cis RA or 13-cis RA. P450-dependent atRA metabolism was demonstrated in HaCaT cells, with a very similar metabolite profile to that produced by our CYP2S1-expressing CHO cells. CYP2S1 mRNA expression was also induced by UVR, more potently than CYP1B1, a known UVR-inducible P450. Our results demonstrate regulatable and functional CYP2S1 expression in HaCaT cells, thus identifying a human cell line model with utility for further analysis of CYP2S1 regulation and substrate specificity.
SDHD mutations are associated with human cancers but the mechanisms that may contribute to transformation are unknown. The hypothesis that mutations in SDHD increase levels of superoxide leading to genomic instability was tested using site-directed mutagenesis to generate a truncated SDHD cDNA that was expressed in Chinese hamster fibroblasts. Stable expression of mutant SDHD resulted in 2-fold increases in steady-state levels of superoxide that were accompanied by a significantly increased mutation rate as well as a 70-fold increase in mutation frequency at the hprt locus. Overexpression of MnSOD or treatment with polyethylene glycol conjugated (PEG)-catalase suppressed mutation frequency in SDHD mutant cells by 50% (P<0.05). Simultaneous treatment with PEG-catalase and PEG-SOD suppressed mutation frequency in SDHD mutant cells by 90% (P<0.0005). Finally, 95% depletion of glutathione using l-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO) in SDHD mutant cells caused a 4-fold increase in mutation frequency (P<0.05). These results demonstrate that mutations in SDHD cause increased steady-state levels of superoxide which significantly contributed to increases in mutation rates and frequency mediated by superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. These results support the hypothesis that mutations in SDHD may contribute to carcinogenesis by increasing genomic instability mediated by increased steady-state levels of reactive oxygen species.
GK (glucokinase) is an enzyme central to glucose metabolism that displays positive co-operativity to substrate glucose. Small-molecule GKAs (GK activators) modulate GK catalytic activity and glucose affinity and are currently being pursued as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes. GK progress curves monitoring product formation are linear up to 1 mM glucose, but biphasic at 5 mM, with the transition from the lower initial velocity to the higher steady-state velocity being described by the rate constant kact. In the presence of a liver-specific GKA (compound A), progress curves at 1 mM glucose are similar to those at 5 mM, reflecting activation of GK by compound A. We show that GKRP (GK regulatory protein) is a slow tight-binding inhibitor of GK. Analysis of progress curves indicate that this inhibition is time dependent, with apparent initial and final Ki values being 113 and 12.8 nM respectively. When GK is pre-incubated with glucose and compound A, the inhibition observed by GKRP is time dependent, but independent of GKRP concentration, reflecting the GKA-controlled transition between closed and open GK conformations. These data are supported by cell-based imaging data from primary rat hepatocytes. This work characterizes the modulation of GK by a novel GKA that may enable the design of new and improved GKAs.
CYP2D6 is a major drug-metabolizing enzyme. Polymorphic variation includes copy number variants such as gene deletions, duplications and multiplications of functional and nonfunctional gene units. In this article we describe the first systematic characterization of a CYP2D6*9x2 gene duplication. CYP2D6*9 is an allelic variant conferring reduced enzymatic activity. This novel gene duplication was discovered in two unrelated Spanish psychiatric patients. Both subjects were initially tested with the AmpliChip CYP450 test, which indicated the presence of a duplication and the CYP2D6*9 allele, but did not make a genotype call. The goal of the study was to resolve this issue by characterizing the CYP2D6 gene locus in these patients.
CYP17A1 gene encodes the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP17A1, a key enzyme involved in steroid metabolism. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near CYP17A1, rs11191548, showed significant association with hypertension in European adults. However, this association has not been demonstrated in children thus far. Additionally, the role of CYP17A1 in elevating blood pressure (BP) is unclear. We investigated the association of rs11191548 with hypertension in Chinese children. A total of 3422 children participated in the study, including 1009 children with elevated BP (EBP, including prehypertension and hypertension) and 2413 children with normal BP. SNP rs11191548 was associated with systolic BP (SBP) (CC vs TT: P=4.8 × 10(-4); additive model: P=0.002; dominant model: P=0.011; recessive model: P=0.001) and EBP (CC vs TT: odds ratio (OR)=0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26-0.72, P=0.001; additive model: OR=0.74, 95% CI 0.61-0.90, P=0.002; dominant model: OR=0.76, 95% CI 0.60-0.96, P=0.022; recessive model: recessive model: OR=0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.77, P=0.003) in girls, but there was no statistically significant association between the SNP and diastolic BP in boys or girls. Our results also showed that rs11191548 was more significantly associated with SBP and EBP in obese girls than in girls of normal weight. Our study indicated that the SNP rs11191548, near CYP17A1, was associated with EBP in children. Moreover, we found a sex-specific effect of rs11191548 on SBP in Chinese children. Further studies are necessary to clarify the association between this CYP17A1 polymorphism and BP.
SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has been employed to study the molecular weight distribution of soluble polypeptides from the 'Parma county ham', a salted pork product. Limited proteolysis was observed, but this was mainly confined to the sarcoplasmic proteins. The results are discussed in the light of previous studies on the same type of products.
CYP46A1 is a neuron-specific cytochrome P450 that plays a pivotal role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in the CNS. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying human CYP46A1 expression are still poorly understood, partly because of the lack of a cellular model that expresses high levels of CYP46A1. Our previous studies demonstrated that specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors control CYP46A1 expression, and are probably responsible for cell-type specificity. Herein, we have differentiated Ntera2/cloneD1 cells into post-mitotic neurons and identified for the first time a human cell model that expresses high levels of CYP46A1 mRNA. Our results show a decrease in Sp1 protein levels, concomitant with the increase in CYP46A1 mRNA levels. This decrease was correlated with changes in the ratio of Sp proteins associated to the CYP46A1 proximal promoter. To examine if the increase in (Sp3+Sp4)/Sp1 ratio was observed in other Sp-regulated promoters, we have selected four genes--reelin, glutamate receptor subunit zeta-1, glutamate receptor subunit epsilon-1 and μ-opioid receptor--known to be expressed in the human brain and analyzed the Sp proteins binding pattern to the promoter of these genes, in undifferentiated and differentiated Ntera2/cloneD1. Our data indicate that the dissociation of Sp1 from promoter regions is a common feature amongst Sp-regulated genes that are up-regulated after neuronal differentiation.
ADSL deficiency is a disorder of purine metabolism with a broad clinical spectrum. A rapid and simple HPLC-based assay to measure ADSL activity in erythrocytes was developed. The suitability of DBSs was assessed. ADSL activity was measured in erythrocyte lysates and DBS using succinyl-AMP as the substrate. Detection and quantification were performed using isocratic ion-pairing reversed-phase HPLC with UV-detection. Reference values in erythrocyte lysates were established. The intra- and interassay variations were 2% and 8%, respectively. ADSL deficiency was easily recognized. ADSL activity in DBS was highly unstable, disqualifying DBS for diagnostic procedures.
ABO incompatible (ABOi) kidney transplantation (KT) has been increasing to compensate for the shortage of organ donors. However, detailed comparative analyses of ABOi KT with ABO compatible (ABOc) KT are still rare.
ABCA3 (ATP-binding cassette subfamily A, member 3) is expressed in the lamellar bodies of alveolar type II cells and is crucial to pulmonary surfactant storage and homeostasis. ABCA3 gene mutations have been associated with neonatal respiratory distress (NRD) and pediatric interstitial lung disease (ILD). The objective of this study was to look for ABCA3 gene mutations in patients with severe NRD and/or ILD. The 30 ABCA3 coding exons were screened in 47 patients with severe NRD and/or ILD. ABCA3 mutations were identified in 10 out of 47 patients, including 2 homozygous, 5 compound heterozygous and 3 heterozygous patients. SP-B and SP-C expression patterns varied across patients. Among patients with ABCA3 mutations, five died shortly after birth and five developed ILD (including one without NRD). Functional studies of p.D253H and p.T1173R mutations revealed that p.D253H and p.T1173R induced abnormal lamellar bodies. Additionally, p.T1173R increased IL-8 secretion in vitro. In conclusion, we identified new ABCA3 mutations in patients with life-threatening NRD and/or ILD. Two mutations associated with ILD acted via different pathophysiological mechanisms despite similar clinical phenotypes.
PTEN is an essential tumor suppressor that antagonizes Akt/PKB signaling. The zebrafish genome encodes two Pten genes, ptena and ptenb. Here, we report that zebrafish mutants that retain a single wild-type copy of ptena or ptenb (ptena(+/-)ptenb(-/-) or ptena(-/-)ptenb(+/-)) are viable and fertile. ptena(+/-)ptenb(-/-) fish develop tumors at a relatively high incidence (10.2%) and most tumors developed close to the eye (26/30). Histopathologically, the tumor masses were associated with the retrobulbar vascular network and diagnosed as hemangiosarcomas. A single tumor was identified in 42 ptena(-/-)ptenb(+/-) fish and was also diagnosed as hemangiosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry indicated that the tumor cells in ptena(+/-)ptenb(-/-) and ptena(-/-)ptenb(+/-) fish proliferated rapidly and were of endothelial origin. Akt/PKB signaling was activated in the tumors, whereas Ptena was still detected in tumor tissue from ptena(+/-)ptenb(-/-) zebrafish. We conclude that haploinsufficiency of the genes encoding Pten predisposes to hemangiosarcoma in zebrafish.
CYP7A1 encodes cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, an enzyme crucial to cholesterol homeostasis. Its transcriptional activity is downregulated by fenofibrate. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of CYP7A1 polymorphisms on lipid changes in response to fenofibrate.
CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 responsible for the final steps of cortisol and aldosterone synthesis, respectively, are believed to be duplicate genes with distinctive promoters. Our sequence analysis uncovers that these two genes share great homology in the proximal upstream regions, but insertion of Alu and L1 elements drives promoters divergent. Each CYP11B promoter contains two Alu elements embedded in a truncated L1 element, breaking L1 into three disconnected fragments. Alu functions as an enhancer in both genes regardless of orientation and copy number. Insertion of Alu upstream of a SV40 promoter also elevates promoter activity. However, the effect of Alu on CYP11B1 is blocked by a second L1 element (CYP11B1-L1.2) inserted between the first one and the conserved proximal upstream region. Although CYP11B1-L1.2 is 5'-truncated and lacks a functional ORF, replacing it with a fluorescent gene demonstrates that the element can be transcribed from the CYP11B1 core promoter in an opposite direction and a smaller magnitude compared to CYP11B1. Deletion of CYP11B1-L1.2 greatly increases CYP11B1 promoter activity and restores the enhancing effect of Alu. The Ad5 and SF-1 binding elements conserved in the proximal core promoter play a role in basal expression of both genes. Mutation of the Ad5 site reduces promoter activity to the minimal level. ERRα is the transcription factor interacting with Ad5 during basal expression. The core promoters of both genes are also conserved in mouse and rat despite the fact that the sites corresponding to cre, Ad5, and SF-1 in rodent Cyp11b1 promoters deviate from consensus.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor best characterized for its role as a lipid phosphatase in antagonizing the PI3-kinase pathway. Several recent studies have identified proteins that form high molecular weight complexes with PTEN in different subcellular compartments. PTEN is critical for early embryonic development, cell proliferation, cell survival and stem cell function. The discovery of PTEN complex components may help our understanding of its biological functions. In this review, PTEN complex components, functions and their regulation will be discussed.
ABCG2 is involved in epithelial transport/barrier functions. Here, we have investigated its ability to transport bile acids in liver and placenta. Cholylglycylamido fluorescein (CGamF) was exported by WIF-B9/R cells, which do not express the bile salt export pump (BSEP). Sensitivity to typical inhibitors suggested that CGamF export was mainly mediated by ABCG2. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO cells), coexpression of rat Oatp1a1 and human ABCG2 enhanced the uptake and efflux, respectively, of CGamF, cholic acid (CA), glycoCA (GCA), tauroCA, and taurolithocholic acid-3-sulfate. The ability of ABCG2 to export these bile acids was confirmed by microinjecting them together with inulin in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing this pump. ABCG2-mediated bile acid transport was inhibited by estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide and fumitremorgin C. Placental barrier for bile acids accounted for <2-fold increase in fetal cholanemia despite >14-fold increased maternal cholanemia induced by obstructive cholestasis in pregnant rats. In rat placenta, the expression of Abcg2, which was much higher than that of Bsep, was not affected by short-term cholestasis. In pregnant rats, fumitremorgin C did not affect uptake/secretion of GCA by the liver but inhibited its fetal-maternal transfer. Compared with wild-type mice, obstructive cholestasis in pregnant Abcg2(-/-) knockout mice induced similar bile acid accumulation in maternal serum but higher accumulation in placenta, fetal serum, and liver. In conclusion, ABCG2 is able to transport bile acids. The importance of this function depends on the relative expression in the same epithelium of other bile acid exporters. Thus, ABCG2 may play a key role in bile acid transport in placenta, as BSEP does in liver.
CYP24A1 is the cytochrome P450 component of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3)-24-hydroxylase enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (25-OH-D(3)) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)) into 24-hydroxylated products, which constitute the degradation of the vitamin D molecule. This review focuses on recent data in the CYP24A1 field, including biochemical, physiological and clinical developments. Notable among these are: the first crystal structure for rat CYP24A1; mutagenesis studies which change the regioselectivity of the enzyme; and the finding that natural inactivating mutations of CYP24A1 cause the genetic disease idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH). The review also discusses the emerging correlation between rising serum phosphate/FGF-23 levels and increased CYP24A1 expression in chronic kidney disease, which in turn underlies accelerated degradation of both serum 25-OH-D(3) and 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) in this condition. This review concludes by evaluating the potential clinical utility of blocking this enzyme with CYP24A1 inhibitors in various disease states.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10) is a well established tumor suppressor gene, which was cloned to chromosome 10q23. PTEN plays an important role in controlling cell growth, apoptosis, cell adhesion, and cell migration. In various studies, a genetic change as well as loss of PTEN expression by different carcinomas has been described. To date, the role of PTEN as a differentiation marker for neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and for the loss of PTEN expression is still unknown. It is assumed that loss of PTEN expression is important for tumor progression of NETs. We hypothesize that PTEN might be used as a new prognostic marker. We report 38 patients with a NET of the pancreas. Tumor tissues were surgically resected, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin. PTEN expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and was correlated with several clinical and pathological parameters of each individual tumor. After evaluation of our immunohistochemistry data using a modified Remmele Score, a widely accepted method for categorizing staining results for reports and statistical evaluation, staining results of PTEN expression were correlated with the clinical and pathological parameters of each individual tumor. Our data demonstrates a significant difference in survival with existence of lymph node or distant metastases. Negative patients show a significant better survival compared with positive patients. Furthermore, we show a significant difference between PTEN expression and WHO or TNM classification. Taken together, our data shows a positive correlation between WHO classification and the new TNM classification of NETs, and loss of PTEN expression as well as survival. These results strongly implicate that PTEN might be helpful as a new prognostic factor.
ABCG2 is an ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) transporter that confers multidrug resistance (MDR) to tumor cells by extruding a broad variety of chemotherapeutic agents, ultimately leading to failure of cancer therapy. Thus, the down-regulation of ABCG2 expression and/or function has been proposed as part of a regimen to improve cancer therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we found that a group of xanthines including caffeine, theophylline, and dyphylline can dramatically decrease ABCG2 protein in cells that have either moderate (BeWo, a placental choriocarcinoma cell line) or high (MCF-7/MX100, a breast cancer drug-resistant cell subline) levels of ABCG2 expression. This down-regulation is time-dependent, dose-dependent, and reversible. Using lysosomal inhibitors, we found that xanthines decreased ABCG2 by inducing its rapid internalization and lysosome-mediated degradation. As a consequence, caffeine treatment significantly increased the retention of an established ABCG2 substrate in MCF-7/MX100 cells but not in parental MCF-7 cells and sensitized the MDR cells to the chemotherapeutic agent mitoxantrone (MX); combination treatment with MX and caffeine decreased the IC(50) of MX ~10-fold and induced a greater degree of apoptotic cell death than MX treatment alone. Taken together, our results describe a novel function for this large class of therapeutically relevant compounds and suggest that a subset of xanthines could be developed as combination therapy to improve the efficacy of anticancer drugs that are ABCG2 substrates.
PTEN deletions in prostate cancer are associated with tumor aggression and poor outcome. Recent studies have implicated PTEN as a determinant of homologous recombination (HR) through defective RAD51 function. Similar to BRCA1/2-defective tumor cells, PTEN-null prostate and other cancer cells have been reported to be sensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPi). To date, no direct comparison between PTEN and RAD51 expression in primary prostate tumors has been reported.
SLC26A4 encodes pendrin, a transporter exchanging anions such as chloride, bicarbonate, and iodide. Loss of function mutations of SLC26A4 cause Pendred syndrome characterized by hearing loss and enlarged vestibular aqueducts as well as variable hypothyroidism and goiter. In the kidney, pendrin is expressed in the distal nephron and accomplishes HCO(3)(-) secretion and Cl(-) reabsorption. Renal pendrin expression is regulated by acid-base balance. The liver contributes to acid-base regulation by producing or consuming glutamine, which is utilized by the kidney for generation and excretion of NH(4)(+), paralleled by HCO(3)(-) formation. Little is known about the regulation of pendrin in liver. The present study thus examined the expression of Slc26a4 in liver and kidney of mice drinking tap water without or with NaHCO(3) (150 mM), NH(4)Cl (280 mM) or acetazolamide (3.6 mM) for seven days. As compared to Gapdh transcript levels, Slc26a4 transcript levels were moderately lower in liver than in renal tissue. Slc26a4 transcript levels were not significantly affected by NaHCO(3) in liver, but significantly increased by NaHCO(3) in kidney. Pendrin protein expression was significantly enhanced in kidney and reduced in liver by NaHCO(3). Slc26a4 transcript levels were significantly increased by NH(4)Cl and acetazolamide in liver, and significantly decreased by NH(4)Cl and by acetazolamide in kidney. NH(4)Cl and acetazolamide reduced pendrin protein expression significantly in kidney, but did not significantly modify pendrin protein expression in liver. The observations point to expression of pendrin in the liver and to opposite effects of acidosis on pendrin transcription in liver and kidney.
PAH is a chronic disease requiring lifelong therapy, regardless of chosen treatment options. Nurses and other providers must allow for open, honest discussion on the risks and benefits of each therapy. Determining the best treatment option for patients requires consideration of the patient's overall function and social support. These patients benefit from comprehensive and collaborative support from facilities or centers trained in the management of the disease.
CD36 fatty acid translocase plays a key role in supplying heart with its major energy substrate, long-chain fatty acids (FA). Previously, we found that the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) harbors a deletion variant of Cd36 gene that results in reduced transport of long-chain FA into cardiomyocytes and predisposes the SHR to cardiac hypertrophy. In the current study, we analyzed the effects of mutant Cd36 on susceptibility to ischemic ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial infarction in adult SHR-Cd36 transgenic rats with wild-type Cd36 compared with age-matched SHR controls. Using an open-chest model of coronary artery occlusion, we found that SHR-Cd36 transgenic rats showed profound arrhythmogenesis resulting in significantly increased duration of tachyarrhythmias (207 ± 48 s vs. 55 ± 21 s, P < 0.05), total number of premature ventricular complexes (2,623 ± 517 vs. 849 ± 250, P < 0.05) and arrhythmia score (3.86 ± 0.18 vs. 3.13 ± 0.13, P < 0.001). On the other hand, transgenic SHR compared with SHR controls showed significantly reduced infarct size (52.6 ± 4.3% vs. 72.4 ± 2.9% of area at risk, P < 0.001). Similar differences were observed in isolated perfused hearts, and the increased susceptibility of transgenic SHR to arrhythmias was abolished by reserpine, suggesting the involvement of catecholamines. To further search for possible molecular mechanisms of altered ischemic tolerance, we compared gene expression profiles in left ventricles dissected from 6-wk-old transgenic SHR vs. age-matched controls using Illumina-based sequencing. Circadian rhythms and oxidative phosphorylation were identified as the top KEGG pathways, while circadian rhythms, VDR/RXR activation, IGF1 signaling, and HMGB1 signaling were the top IPA canonical pathways potentially important for Cd36-mediated effects on ischemic tolerance. It can be concluded that transgenic expression of Cd36 plays an important role in modulating the incidence and severity of ischemic and reperfusion ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial infarct size induced by coronary artery occlusion. The proarrhythmic effect of Cd36 transgene appears to be dependent on adrenergic stimulation.
CD38 is a signaling enzyme responsible for catalyzing the synthesis of cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate; both are universal Ca(2+) messenger molecules. Ablation of the CD38 gene in mice causes multiple physiological defects, including impaired oxytocin release, that result in altered social behavior. A series of catalysis-based inhibitors of CD38 were designed and synthesized, starting with arabinosyl-2'-fluoro-2'-deoxynicotinamide mononucleotide. Structure-function relationships were analyzed to assess the structural determinants important for inhibiting the NADase activity of CD38. X-ray crystallography was used to reveal the covalent intermediates that were formed with the catalytic residue, Glu226. Metabolically stable analogues that were resistant to inactivation by phosphatase and esterase were synthesized and shown to be effective in inhibiting intracellular cADPR production in human HL-60 cells during induction of differentiation by retinoic acid. The inhibition was species-independent, and the analogues were similarly effective in blocking the cyclization reaction of CD38 in rat ventricular tissue extracts, as well as inhibiting the α-agonist-induced constriction in rat mesentery arteries. These compounds thus represent the first generally applicable and catalysis-based inhibitors of the Ca(2+) signaling function of CD38.
SLC26A3 is a Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger that plays a major role in Cl(-) absorption from the intestine. Its mutation causes congenital chloride-losing diarrhea. It has been shown that SLC26A3 are glycosylated, with the attached carbohydrate being extracellular and perhaps modulating function. However, the role of glycosylation has yet to be clearly determined. We used the approaches of biochemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis to prevent glycosylation. Deglycosylation experiments with glycosidases indicated that the mature glycosylated form of SLC26A3 exists at the plasma membrane, and a putative large second extracellular loop contains all of the N-linked carbohydrates. Deglycosylation of SLC26A3 causes depression of transport activity compared with wild-type, although robust intracellular pH changes were still observed, suggesting that N-glycosylation is not absolutely necessary for transport activity. To localize glycosylation sites, we mutated the five consensus sites by replacing asparagine (N) with glutamine. Immnoblotting suggests that SLC26A3 is glycosylated at N153, N161, and N165. Deglycosylation of SLC26A3 causes a defect in cell surface processing with decreased cell surface expression. We also assessed whether SLC26A3 is protected from tryptic digestion. While the mature glycosylated SLC26A3 showed little breakdown after treatment with trypsin, deglycosylated SLC26A3 exhibited increased susceptibility to trypsin, suggesting that the oligosaccharides protect SLC26A3 from tryptic digestion. In conclusion, our data indicate that N-glycosylation of SLC26A3 is important for cell surface expression and for protection from proteolytic degradation that may contribute to the understanding of pathogenesis of congenital disorders of glycosylation.
ABO is the most clinically important blood group system in transfusion and transplantation medicine. The popular ABO genotyping methods, such as the sequencing of exons 6 and 7 and sequence-specific primer (SSP)-PCR, often lead to ambiguous typing results. Long PCR-sequencing method was designed to analyze two regulatory regions (promoter and CBF/NF-Y enhancer regions) and all genomic sequences (except for intron 1) of the ABO gene. Using rapid DNA polymerase with high-fidelity, we amplified 6.3 kb and 7.3 kb for sequencing of enhancer-exon 1 and exons 2-7, respectively. ABO genotyping was performed using this technique in the peripheral blood of three unrelated families. The time requirements of the PCR amplification and purification processes were about 2.0 hours and 15 minutes, respectively. Five different ABO alleles (ABO A102, ABO A105, ABO O01, ABO O02, and ABO B101) with allele-specific CBF/NF-Y minisatellite repeats from three families were analyzed. All genotyping results agreed with serologic findings and results expected by Mendelian inheritance. Compared to conventional PCR-direct sequencing for ABO genotyping, this method proves simple and fast for the analysis of ABO genotypes. Therefore, it might be valuable in clinical transfusion or forensic applications.
G6PD deficiency is common in malaria endemic regions and is estimated to affect more than 400 million people worldwide. Treatment of malaria patients with the anti-malarial drug primaquine or other 8-aminoquinolines may be associated with potential haemolytic anaemia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of G6PD variants in Thai population who resided in malaria endemic areas (western, northern, north-eastern, southern, eastern and central regions) of Thailand, as well as the Burmese population who resided in areas along the Thai-Myanmar border.
PIGA mutations in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients lead to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked membrane proteins expression deficiency. Herein, we report the constitutive expression of the transmembrane CD160 (CD160-TM) activating receptor on non PIGA-mutated PNH patients circulating NK cells. In healthy individuals, only the GPI-anchored isoform of CD160 receptors is expressed on the circulating NK lymphocytes, while the transmembrane isoform appears after ex vivo activation. Similarly to CD160-GPI, we identified CD160-TM as a receptor for the MHC class I molecules. We demonstrate that PNH patients NK lymphocytes spontaneously produce significant amounts of IFN-γ that is inhibited by anti-CD160-TM or anti-MHC class I mAbs. These results indicate that circulating NK cells from PNH patients exhibit a self-MHC class I molecule reactive effector function, which could be mediated through the recruitment of CD160-TM receptor. Our data provide new insights regarding the possible role of CD160-TM on PNH patients NK lymphocytes and in the pathogenesis of the disease.
CYP11B1 catalyzes the final step of cortisol biosynthesis. The effects of flavonoids on transcriptional expression and enzyme activity of CYP11B1 were investigated using the human adrenocortical H295R cell model. All tested nonhydroxylated flavones including 3',4'-dimethoxyflavone, α-naphthoflavone, and β-naphthoflavone upregulated CYP11B1 expression and cortisol production, whereas apigenin and quercetin exhibited potent cytotoxicity and CYP11B1 repression at high concentrations. Nonhydroxylated flavones stimulated CYP11B1-catalyzed cortisol formation at transcriptional level. Resveratrol increased endogenous and substrate-supported cortisol production like nonhydroxylated flavones tested, but it had no effect on CYP11B1 gene expression and enzyme activity. Resveratrol appeared to alter cortisol biosynthesis at an earlier step. The Ad5 element situated in the -121/-106 region was required for basal and flavone-induced CYP11B1 expression. Overexpression of COUP-TFI did not improve the responsiveness of Ad5 to nonhydroxylated flavones. Although COUP-TFI overexpression increased CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 promoter activation, its effect was not mediated through the common Ad5 element. Treating cells with PD98059 (a flavone-type MEK1 inhibitor) increased CYP11B1 promoter activity, but not involving ERK signaling because phosphorylation of ERK1/2 remained unvarying throughout the course of treatment. Likewise, AhR was not responsible for the CYP11B1-modulating effects of flavonoids because inconsistency with their effects on AhR activation. 3',4'-dimethoxyflavone and 8-Br-cAMP additively activated CYP11B1 promoter activity. H-89 reduced 3',4'-dimethoxyflavone-induced CYP11B1 promoter activation but to a lesser extent as compared to its inhibition on cAMP-induced transactivation. Our data suggest that constant exposure to nonhydroxylated flavones raises a potential risk of high basal and cAMP-induced cortisol synthesis in consequence of increased CYP11B1 expression.
IDH1 mutations are present but are uncommon in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and although prognostically favorable in gliomas their clinical significance in AML is unclear. Some have associated IDH1 mutations with inferior outcome, whereas others found no association with prognosis. Complicating these analyses is the need to sequence IDH1 from leukemic blasts, which is technically challenging and not yet routine. Mutation-specific antibodies enable robust, cost-effective detection of mutations in routine biopsy samples. Immunohistochemistry for the R132H mutation-specific antibody was performed in a tissue microarray containing 159 cases of AML, detecting the R132H mutation in 7 cases (4.4%). Positivity was associated with intermediate risk cytogenetics. Our results demonstrate an association between the R132H IDH1 mutation and intermediate risk cytogenetics in AML, suggesting that R132H IDH1 mutation may be associated with improved clinical outcome and demonstrate the feasibility of using mutation-specific antibodies to genotype and subclassify AML.
CYP1B1 activates procarcinogens in some human tissues, including the urinary tract. Changes related to genetic polymorphisms are a known risk factor for cancer. We analyzed the association between CYP1B1 sequence variations and bladder cancer.
ABO grouping of biological specimens is informative for identifying victims and narrowing down suspects. In Japan and elsewhere, ABO grouping as well as DNA profiling plays an essential role in crime investigations. In the present study, we developed a new method for ABO genotyping using allele-specific primers and real-time PCR. The method allows for the detection of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at nucleotide positions 261, 796, and 803 in the ABO gene and the determination of six major ABO genotypes. This method required less than 2 h for accurate ABO genotyping using 2.0 ng of DNA. This method could be applicable for rapid and simple screening of forensic samples.
CYP19A1 in the brain and pituitary of vertebrates is important for reproductive and non-reproductive processes. In teleosts, it is broadly accepted that estradiol (E(2)) up-regulates cyp19a1b gene via a positive autoregulatory loop. Our present study, however, showed that E(2) did not up-regulate ricefield eel cyp19a1b in the hypothalamus and pituitary, whereas dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or testosterone (T) stimulated cyp19a1b expression only in the pituitary. Two tissue-specific promoters, namely promoter I and II directing the expression in the brain and pituitary respectively, were identified. Promoter I contained a non-consensus estrogen response element (ERE), and consequently did not respond to E(2). Promoter II contained an androgen response element (ARE) and consequently responded to DHT. Taken together, these results demonstrated a novel steroidal regulation of cyp19a1b gene expression and an alternative usage of tissue-specific cyp19a1b promoters in the brain and pituitary of a teleost species, the ricefield eel.
CYP24A1 functions in vitamin D target tissues to degrade 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)). Thus, the concentration of this enzyme and the regulation of its expression is a primary determinant of the overall biological activity of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) within cells. The principle regulator of CYP24A1 expression is 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) itself, which functions through the vitamin D receptor to upregulate the transcriptional activity of the Cyp24a1 gene. In this report, we explore the mechanism of this regulation using recently developed ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq techniques that permit an unbiased search for enhancer elements that participate in this transcriptional control. Our studies both confirm a regulatory region defined earlier and located proximal to the transcriptional start site (TSS) of mouse Cyp24a1 (-160 and -265nt) and identify a novel intergenic region located downstream of the transcription unit that contains two enhancers (+35 and +37kb) that facilitate 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-dependent upregulation of Cyp24a1 expression. Interestingly, while C/EBPβ also binds under basal conditions to a site located immediately upstream of the Cyp24a1 promoter (-345nt), occupancy by this factor is strikingly increased following 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment. The locations and activities of these regulatory regions that mediate 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) actions were confirmed in mice in vivo. We conclude that the mechanism through which 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induces the CYP24A1 enzyme, thereby autoregulating its own destruction, involves both promoter-proximal as well as downstream-distal enhancers. These findings highlight new concepts regarding the molecular mechanism of action of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and other hormonal regulators.
PTEN (Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) expression in stromal fibroblasts suppresses epithelial mammary tumours, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Using proteomic and expression profiling, we show that Pten loss from mammary stromal fibroblasts activates an oncogenic secretome that orchestrates the transcriptional reprogramming of other cell types in the microenvironment. Downregulation of miR-320 and upregulation of one of its direct targets, ETS2 (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2) are critical events in Pten-deleted stromal fibroblasts responsible for inducing this oncogenic secretome, which in turn promotes tumour angiogenesis and tumour-cell invasion. Expression of the Pten-miR-320-Ets2-regulated secretome distinguished human normal breast stroma from tumour stroma and robustly correlated with recurrence in breast cancer patients. This work reveals miR-320 as a critical component of the Pten tumour-suppressor axis that acts in stromal fibroblasts to reprogramme the tumour microenvironment and curtail tumour progression.
CYP2D6 plays a major role in the metabolism of tamoxifen, and polymorphism of P-glycoprotein has been associated with resistance of many drug therapies. This study investigates the clinical impact of genetic variants of CYP2D6 and ABCB1 in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen. Blood samples from 95 breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen were collected and genotyped for CYP2D6 and ABCB1 variants using allele-specific PCR method. Recurrence risks were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using the log-rank test. Patients carrying CYP2D6*10/*10 and heterozygous null allele (IM) showed higher risks of developing recurrence and metastasis (OR 13.14; 95% CI 1.57-109.94; P = 0.004) than patients with CYP2D6*1/*1 and *1/*10 genotypes. Patients with homozygous CC genotypes of ABCB1 C3435T showed a shorter time to recurrence. Patients who were CYP2D6 IM and homozygous CC genotype of C3435T have statistically significant higher risks of recurrence (P = 0.002). Similarly, median time to recurrence in these patients was only 12 months (95% CI = 0.79-23.2) compared to those without this combination which was 48 months (95% CI = 14.7-81.2). Patients with CYP2D6 IM and homozygous CC genotype of ABCB1 C3435T have shorter times to recurrence. The results confirmed the findings of previous studies and support FDA recommendation to perform pre-genotyping in patients before the choice of therapy is determined in breast cancer patients.
AQP4 water channels are thought to be the target of autoimmune attack in neuromyelitis optica-spectrum disorders (NMOsd). AQP4 are highly expressed on ventricular ependyma. The objective of this study was to describe a novel pattern of linear, 'pencil-thin' enhancement of ventricular ependyma in NMOsd. We report two NMOsd patients with pencil-thin ependymal enhancement along the frontal and occipital horns of lateral ventricles. Differential diagnosis of ependymal enhancement should include NMOsd alongside with infectious and neoplastic etiologies. Pencil-thin ependymal enhancement may be a helpful radiological marker of NMOsd that can be used to differentiate this condition from multiple sclerosis.
CYP2D6 has received intense attention since the beginning of the pharmacogenetic era in the 1970s. This is because of its involvement in the metabolism of more than 25% of the marketed drugs, the large geographical and inter-ethnic differences in the genetic polymorphism and possible drug-induced toxicity. Many interesting reviews have been published on CYP2D6 and this review aims to reinstate the importance of the genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 in different populations as well as some clinical implications and important drug interactions.
ABO blood group antigens are formed by terminal glycosylation of glycoproteins and glycolipid chains present on cell surfaces. Glycosylation modulates all kinds of cell-to-cell interactions and this may be relevant in malaria pathophysiology, in which adhesion has been increasingly implicated in disease severity. This study was done to determine the association between ABO phenotypes and the severity of P. falciparum malaria in children.
AKR1B10 is considered to contribute to cell proliferation and chemoresistance. In the present study, we examined whether AKR1B10 expression is associated with disease-free survival in bladder cancer patients.
CYP27A1 is a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 which can hydroxylate vitamin D3 and cholesterol at carbons 25 and 26, respectively. The product of vitamin D3 metabolism, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, is the precursor to the biologically active hormone, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. CYP27A1 is attached to the inner mitochondrial membrane and substrates appear to reach the active site through the membrane phase. We have therefore examined the ability of bacterially expressed and purified CYP27A1 to metabolize substrates incorporated into phospholipid vesicles which resemble the inner mitochondrial membrane. We also examined the ability of CYP27A1 to metabolize 20-hydroxyvitamin D3 (20(OH)D3), a novel non-calcemic form of vitamin D derived from CYP11A1 action on vitamin D3 which has anti-proliferative activity on keratinocytes, leukemic and myeloid cells. CYP27A1 displayed high catalytic activity towards cholesterol with a turnover number (k(cat)) of 9.8 min(-1) and K(m) of 0.49 mol/mol phospholipid (510 μM phospholipid). The K(m) value of vitamin D3 was similar for that of cholesterol, but the k(cat) was 4.5-fold lower. 20(OH)D3 was metabolized by CYP27A1 to two major products with a k(cat)/K(m) that was 2.5-fold higher than that for vitamin D3, suggesting that 20(OH)D3 could effectively compete with vitamin D3 for catalysis. NMR and mass spectrometric analyses revealed that the two major products were 20,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 20,26-dihydroxyvitamin D3, in almost equal proportions. Thus, the presence of the 20-hydroxyl group on the vitamin D3 side chain enables it to be metabolized more efficiently than vitamin D3, with carbon 26 in addition to carbon 25 becoming a major site of hydroxylation. Our study reports the highest k(cat) for the 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3 by any human cytochrome P450 suggesting that CYP27A1 might be an important contributor to the synthesis of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, particularly in tissues where it is highly expressed.
ATP6V1F encodes a component of vacuolar ATPase mediating acidification. The cDNA and the genomic sequences of ATP6V1F were cloned successfully for the first time from the Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and touchdown-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The cDNA fragment cloned is 364 bp in size, containing an open reading frame of 360 bp encoding 119 amino acids. Alignment analysis indicated that both ORF and the deduced amino acid sequence are highly conserved. The length of the genomic sequence of the Giant Panda is 2225 bp, including two exons and one intron. Topology prediction showed that there is one protein kinase C phosphorylation site, two Casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and one N-myristoylation site in the ATP6V1F protein. The ATP6V1F gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli indicating that ATP6V1F fusion with the N-terminally His-tagged form gave rise to the accumulation of an expected 17 kDa polypeptide, which was according with the predicted protein and also could be used to purify the protein and study its function.
CYP1A1 (cytochrome P4501A1) catalyze the conversion of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into reactive metabolites, which may induce DNA damage. We hypothesized that DNA methylation of the CYP1A1 enhancer could be involved in inter-individual differences in mRNA levels of CYP1A1 or affect the smoking-induced DNA damage in human lung. Using DNA bisulfite conversion and pyrosequencing, we show that DNA methylation of the CYP1A1 enhancer is affected by smoking. In adjacent histologically normal lung from lung cancer patients (n = 120), low levels of DNA methylation of the CYP1A1 enhancer were related to high levels of smoking-induced hydrophobic DNA adduct (p < 0.03), and to the presence of TP53 or K-ras mutations in the corresponding lung tumors (p < 0.03). We found an inverse correlation between DNA methylation of the CYP1A1 enhancer and mRNA levels in vivo (Spearman r = -0.54; p < 0.0001). Thus, in lung tumor tissues, the CYP1A1 enhancer hypermethylation was associated with lower mRNA levels compared to adjacent histologically normal tissue (p < 0.0001). In vitro, using a panel of cultured human lung cells, we found hypermethylation of the CYP1A1 enhancer in cancer cell lines and an inverse correlation between DNA methylation and mRNA levels (Spearman r = -0.53; p = 0.003). Altogether, our results indicated that low levels of DNA methylation of the CYP1A1 enhancer in histologically normal human lung were associated with high CYP1A1 mRNA levels and with smoking-induced genetic alterations; thus, it may play a role in the initiation of lung carcinogenesis.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome TEN) is the major negative regulator of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling and has cell-specific functions including tumor suppression. Nuclear localization of PTEN is vital for tumor suppression; however, outside of cancer, the molecular and physiological events driving PTEN nuclear entry are unknown. In this paper, we demonstrate that cytoplasmic Pten was translocated into the nuclei of neurons after cerebral ischemia in mice. Critically, this transport event was dependent on a surge in the Nedd4 family-interacting protein 1 (Ndfip1), as neurons in Ndfip1-deficient mice failed to import Pten. Ndfip1 binds to Pten, resulting in enhanced ubiquitination by Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases. In vitro, Ndfip1 overexpression increased the rate of Pten nuclear import detected by photobleaching experiments, whereas Ndfip1(-/-) fibroblasts showed negligible transport rates. In vivo, Ndfip1 mutant mice suffered larger infarct sizes associated with suppressed phosphorylated Akt activation. Our findings provide the first physiological example of when and why transient shuttling of nuclear Pten occurs and how this process is critical for neuron survival.
CYP1A1 is the phase I enzyme that detoxifies the carcinogen or converts it into a more electrophilic form, metabolized by phase II enzymes like GSTP1. These detoxifying genes have been extensively studied in association with head and neck cancer (HNC) in different ethnic groups worldwide. The current study was aimed at screening genetic polymorphisms of genes CYP1A1 and GSTP1 in 388 Pakistani HNC patients and 150 cancer-free healthy controls, using PCR-SSCP. No already known variants of either gene were found, however a novel frameshift mutation due to insertion of T (g.2842_2843insT) was observed in the CYP1A1 gene. A statistically significant number (5.4%) of HNC cases, with the mean age of 51.75 (±15.7) years, presented this frameshift mutation in the conserved domain of CYP1A1. Another novel substitution mutation in was found in the GSTP1 gene, presenting TA instead of AG. The g.2848A > T polymorphism causes a leucine-to-leucine formation, whereas g.2849G > A causes alanine-to-threonine formation at amino acid positions 166 and 167, respectively. These exonic mutations were found in 9.5% of the HNC patients and in none of the controls. In addition, two intronic deletions of C (g.1074delC and g.1466delC) were also found in 11 patients with a mean age of 46.2 (±15.6) years. In conclusion, accumulation of mutations in genes CYP1A1 and GSTP1 appears to be associated with increased risk of developing HNC, suggesting that mutations in these genes may play a role in the etiology of head and neck cancer.
CYP2D6 belongs to the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes and plays an important role in the metabolism of 20-25% of clinically used drugs including antidepressants. It displays inter-individual and inter-ethnic variability in activity ranging from complete absence to excessive activity which causes adverse drug reactions and toxicity or therapy failure even at normal drug doses. This variability is due to genetic polymorphisms which form poor, intermediate, extensive or ultrarapid metaboliser phenotypes. This study aimed to determine CYP2D6 alleles and their frequencies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) local population. CYP2D6 alleles and genotypes were determined by direct DNA sequencing in 151 Emiratis with the majority being psychiatric patients on antidepressants. Several new alleles have been identified and in total we identified seventeen alleles and 49 genotypes. CYP2D6*1 (wild type) and CYP2D6*2 alleles (extensive metaboliser phenotype) were found with frequencies of 39.1% and 12.2%, respectively. CYP2D6*41 (intermediate metaboliser) occurred in 15.2%. Homozygous CYP2D6*4 allele (poor metaboliser) was found with a frequency of 2% while homozygous and heterozygous CYP2D6*4 occurred with a frequency of 9%. CYP2D6*2xn, caused by gene duplication (ultrarapid metaboliser) had a frequency of 4.3%. CYP2D6 gene duplication/multiduplication occurred in 16% but only 11.2% who carried more than 2 active functional alleles were considered ultrarapid metabolisers. CYP2D6 gene deletion in one copy occurred in 7.5% of the study group. In conclusion, CYP2D6 gene locus is heterogeneous in the UAE national population and no significant differences have been identified between the psychiatric patients and controls.
CD36 is a type 2 scavenger receptor with multiple functions. CD36 binding to oxidized LDL triggers signaling cascades that are required for macrophage foam cell formation, but the mechanisms by which CD36 signals remain incompletely understood. Mass spectrometry analysis of anti-CD36 immuno-precipitates from macrophages identified the tetraspanin CD9 as a CD36 interacting protein. Western blot showed that CD9 was precipitated from mouse macrophages by anti-CD36 monoclonal antibody and CD36 was likewise precipitated by anti-CD9, confirming the mass spectrometry results. Macrophages from cd36 null mice were used to demonstrate specificity. Membrane associations of the two proteins on intact cells was analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and by a novel cross linking assay that detects proteins in close proximity (<40 nm). Functional significance was determined by assessing lipid accumulation, foam cell formation and JNK activation in wt, cd9 null and cd36 null macrophages exposed to oxLDL. OxLDL uptake, lipid accumulation, foam cell formation, and JNK phosphorylation were partially impaired in cd9 null macrophages. The present study demonstrates that CD9 associates with CD36 on the macrophage surface and may participate in macrophage signaling in response to oxidized LDL.
SDS is mostly used to enhance the solubilization and extraction of membrane proteins due to its strong detergency and low cost. Nevertheless, SDS interferes with the subsequent procedures and needs to be removed from the samples. In this work, a special gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE) system was developed to remove SDS from the SDS-solubilized protein samples. As a proof-of-principle experiment, the GGE system was designed to be composed of an agarose loading layer, six polyacrylamide fractionation layers with different concentrations and a high-concentration polyacrylamide sealing layer. The advantages of the GGE system are that it not only can electrophoretically remove SDS efficiently so that the protein loss resulted from the repeated gel washing after electrophoresis was avoided, but also can reduce the complexity of the sample, prevent the precipitation of proteins after loading and avoid the loss of proteins with low molecular weight during the electrophoresis. Using GGE system, about 85% of SDS in the sample and gel was electrophoretically removed and the proteins were fractionated. Compared with the two representative gel-based sample cleanup methods reported in literature, GGE-based strategy significantly improved the identification efficiency of proteins in terms of the number and coverage of the identified proteins.
CD38 is a multifunctional protein possessing ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity responsible for both the synthesis and the degradation of several Ca(2+)-mobilizing second messengers. Although a variety of functions have been ascribed to CD38, such as immune responses, insulin secretion, and social behavior in adults, nothing is known of its role during embryonic development when Ca(2+) signals feature prominently. Here, we report the identification and functional expression of CD38 from Xenopus laevis, a key model organism for the study of vertebrate development. We show that CD38 expression and endogenous ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity are developmentally regulated during cellular differentiation. Chemical or molecular inhibition of CD38 abolished ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity and disrupted elongation of the anterior-posterior axis and differentiation of skeletal muscle, culminating in embryonic death. Our data uncover a previously unknown role for CD38 as an essential regulator of embryonic development.
GNE myopathy (MIM 600737) is an autosomal recessive muscle disease caused by mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene. Besides the typical phenotype, characterized by the initial involvement of the distal leg muscles that eventually spreads proximally with sparing of the quadriceps, uncommon presentations with a non-canonical clinical phenotype, unusual muscle biopsy findings or both are increasingly recognized. The aim of our study was to characterize the imaging pattern of pelvic and lower limb muscles in GNE myopathy, thus providing additional diagnostic clues useful in the identification of patients with atypical features. We retrospectively evaluated muscle MRI and CT scans of a cohort of 13 patients heterogeneous for GNE mutations and degree of clinical severity. We found that severe involvement of the biceps femoris short head and, to a lesser extent, of the gluteus minimus, tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis and digitorum longus, soleus and gastrocnemius medialis was consistently present even in patients with early or atypical disease. The vastus lateralis, not the entire quadriceps, was the only muscle spared in advanced stages, while the rectus femoris, vastus intermedius and medialis showed variable signs of fatty replacement. Younger patients showed hyperintensities on T2-weighted sequences in muscles with a normal or, more often, abnormal T1-weighted signal. Our results define a pattern of muscle involvement that appears peculiar to GNE myopathy. Although these findings need to be further validated in a larger cohort, we believe that the recognition of this pattern may be instrumental in the initial clinical assessment of patients with possible GNE myopathy.
CD38 (EC 3.2.2.6, NAD(+)-glycohydrolase) is a multifunctional enzyme catalyzing the synthesis and hydrolysis of cyclic ADP-ribose from NAD(+) to ADP-ribose. The loss of CD38 function is associated with impaired immune responses, metabolic disturbances, and behavioral modifications. Notably, it has been linked to HIV infection, leukemias, myelomas, solid tumors, Type II Diabetes mellitus, bone metabolism, as well as Autism Spectrum Disorder. Taking into account the crucial role played by CD38 in many diseases and in clinical practice, here we assessed the distribution of CD38 NADase activity in a healthy population (104 sex-matched unrelated individuals, 12-98 years) and determined its main predictors among genetic and physiological factors (age and sex). The mean value of CD38 NADase activity was 0.051±0.023 mU/mg (0.010-0.099 mU/mg), following a normal distribution in the study population (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test P=0.200). The TNF-α -308G>A (rs1800629) resulted the main predictor (β=0.364, P=0.00008), followed by Age (β=0.280, P=0.002) and the CD38 184C>G (rs6449182) (β=0.193, P=0.033). Our study contributes to understanding CD38 enzyme physiological functions, by reporting, for the first time, its activity distribution in healthy individuals and demonstrating a significant positive correlation with age. Moreover, the possible use of TNF-α -308G>A (rs1800629) and the CD38 184C>G (rs6449182) SNPs as predictive genetic markers of CD38 activity, clearly point toward possible pharmacogenomic applications and to a more refined use of CD38 in clinical settings.
AOC3 is highly expressed in adipocytes and smooth muscle cells, but its function in these cells is currently unknown. The in vivo substrate(s) of AOC3 is/are also unknown, but could provide an invaluable clue to the enzyme's function. Expression of untagged, soluble human AOC3 in insect cells provides a relatively simple means of obtaining pure enzyme. Characterization of enzyme indicates a 6% titer for the active site 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ) cofactor and corrected k(cat) values as high as 7 s(-1). Substrate kinetic profiling shows that the enzyme accepts a variety of primary amines with different chemical features, including nonphysiological branched-chain and aliphatic amines, with measured k(cat)/K(m) values between 10(2) and 10(4) M(-1) s(-1). K(m)(O(2)) approximates the partial pressure of oxygen found in the interstitial space. Comparison of the properties of purified murine to human enzyme indicates k(cat)/K(m) values that are within 3 to 4-fold, with the exception of methylamine and aminoacetone that are ca. 10-fold more active with human AOC3. With drug development efforts investigating AOC3 as an anti-inflammatory target, these studies suggest that caution is called for when screening the efficacy of inhibitors designed against human enzymes in non-transgenic mouse models. Differentiated murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes show a uniform distribution of AOC3 on the cell surface and whole cell K(m) values that are reasonably close to values measured using purified enzymes. The latter studies support a relevance of the kinetic parameters measured with isolated AOC3 variants to adipocyte function. From our studies, a number of possible substrates with relatively high k(cat)/K(m) have been discovered, including dopamine and cysteamine, which may implicate a role for adipocyte AOC3 in insulin-signaling and fatty acid metabolism, respectively. Finally, the demonstrated AOC3 turnover of primary amines that are non-native to human tissue suggests possible roles for the adipocyte enzyme in subcutaneous bacterial infiltration and obesity.
CYP2C19 variant alleles are independent predictors of clopidogrel response variability and occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events in high-risk vascular patients on clopidogrel therapy. Increasing evidence suggests a combination of platelet function testing with CYP2C19 genetic testing may be more effective in identifying high-risk individuals for alternative antiplatelet therapeutic strategies. A crucial point in evaluating the use of these polymorphisms in clinical practice, besides test accuracy, is the cost of the genetic test and rapid availability of the results. One hundred acute coronary syndrome patients were genotyped for CYP2C19*2,*3,*4,*5, and *17 polymorphisms with two platforms: Verigene(®) and the TaqMan(®) system.
DHODH is a flavoenzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate (DHO) to orotate (ORO) as part of the fourth and rate limiting step of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Inhibitors of DHODHs have proven efficacy for the treatment of cancer, malaria and immunological disorders. 3D QSAR studies on some aryl carboxylic acid amide derivatives as hDHODH inhibitors were performed by comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices (CoMSIA) methods to rationalize the structural requirements responsible for the inhibitory activity of these compounds. The alignment strategy was used for these compounds by means of Distill function defined in SYBYL X 1.2. The best CoMFA and CoMSIA models obtained for the training set were statistically significant with cross-validated coefficients (q²) of 0.636 and 0.604 and conventional coefficients (r²) of 0.993 and 0.950, respectively. Both the models were validated by an external test set of five compounds giving satisfactory prediction (r² pred) of 0.563 and 0.523 for CoMFA and CoMSIA models, respectively. Further the robustness of the model was verified by bootstrapping analysis. Generated CoMFA and CoMSIA models provide useful information for the design of novel inhibitors with good hDHODH inhibitory.
CD36 phosphorylation on its extracellular domain inhibits binding of thrombospondin-1. The mechanisms of cellular CD36 ectodomain phosphorylation and whether it can be regulated in cells are not known. We determined structure-function relationships of CD36 phosphorylation related to thrombospondin-1 peptide binding in vitro and explored mechanisms regulating phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) in melanoma cells.
CYP3A7 is the predominant cytochrome P450 (CYP) expressed in human fetal liver, accounting for 30-50% of the total CYP in fetal liver and 87-100% of total fetal hepatic CYP3A content. However, the lack of a rodent model limits the investigation of CYP3A7 regulation and function. Hence, double-transgenic mice expressing human pregnane X receptor (PXR) and CYP3A4/7 (Tg3A4/7-hPXR) were used to investigate the regulation and function of CYP3A7. Expression of CYP3A7 was monitored in mice that ranged in age from 14.5-d-old embryos to 8.5-d-old newborns; expression of CYP3A7 mRNA was increased before birth in the embryos and decreased after birth in the newborns. This is consistent with the observed developmental regulation of CYP3A7 protein levels and CYP3A7-mediated dehydroepiandrosterone 16α-hydroxylase activities. This developmental flux is also in agreement with previous studies that have investigated the expression of CYP3A7 in developing human liver. The regulation of CYP3A7 was further studied using hepatoblasts from the Tg3A4/7-hPXR mice. Glucocorticoids, including dexamethasone, cortisol, corticosterone, and cortisone all induced the expression of CYP3A7 mRNA, whereas rifampicin, an activator of PXR and an inducer of CYP3A4 in adult liver, had no effect on CYP3A7 expression. Cell-based promoter luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed glucocorticoid receptor-mediated control of the CYP3A7 promoter. These findings indicate that CYP3A7 is developmentally regulated in mouse liver primarily by glucocorticoids through the glucocorticoid receptor. The Tg3A4/7-hPXR mouse model could therefore potentially serve as a tool for investigating CYP3A7 regulation and function.
KCNJ11 polymorphisms have been linked to the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Our aim was to define the contribution of KCNJ11 to new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) among patients treated with Tacrolimus (Tac). A total of 115 NODAT and 205 non-NODAT were genotyped for rs5219 (p.E23K). AA+AG genotypes were significantly associated with NODAT-risk (p=0.004; OR=2.10). The reported effect of this KCNJ11 polymorphism on insulin release by beta cells could explain this association.
COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism has been associated with both symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and disruptive behavior disorders (DBD): that is, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) often comorbid with ADHD. The aim of this study was to test the association between COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism and the presence of DBD in children with ADHD (n = 516). Homozygous Val/Val children showed a higher prevalence of ADHD comorbid with DBD (χ(2) = 5.762; p = 0.016; OR = 1.58; CI(95%) = 1.07-2.35). Our findings replicate previous results and suggest a role for COMT in the etiology of DBD in children and adolescents with ADHD.
ACE inhibitors have established their role in the management of hypertension as well as in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Furthermore, they have proven their role in delaying the worsening of renal function in patients with chronic renal disease. Over the last few years their use to prevent the new onset of diabetes has come to the forefront. Post-hoc analyses of large multi-center clinical trials such as the Captopril Prevention Project and the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation have suggested that their use may delay or prevent the onset of diabetes. However many of these results are based on secondary analyses and few prospective clinical trials exist. In the two prospective trial so far conducted regarding the use of ACEi and ARB as a means to diabetes prevention the effects of these drugs compared to lifestyle modifications have been minimal and do not yet warrant their use to this effect. While there is strong evidence for modulation the Renin-Angiotensin System in patients with hypertension, coronary heart disease and renal dysfunction the evidence for preventing diabetes remains scarce and will need to be investigated further.
CYP2C9 is involved in metabolism of nearly 25% of clinically used drugs. Coding region polymorphisms CYP2C9*2 and *3 contribute to interperson variability in drug dosage and clinical outcomes, whereas the role of a regulatory polymorphism remains uncertain. Measuring allelic RNA expression in 87 human liver samples, combined with genotyping, sequencing, and reporter gene assays, we identified a promoter variable number tandem repeat polymorphism (pVNTR) that fully accounted for allelic CYP2C9 mRNA expression differences. Present in three different variant forms [short (pVNTR-S), medium (pVNTR-M), and long (pVNTR-L)], only the pVNTR-S allele reduced the CYP2C9 mRNA level compared with the pVNTR-M (reference) allele. pVNTR-S is in linkage disequilibrium with *3, with linkage disequilibrium r(2) of 0.53 to 0.75 in different populations. In patients who were taking a maintenance dose of warfarin, the mean warfarin dose was associated with the copies of pVNTR-S (p = 0.0001). However, in multivariate regression models that included the CYP2C9*3, pVNTR-S was no longer a significant predictor of the warfarin dose (p = 0.60). These results indicate that although pVNTR-S reduced CYP2C9 mRNA expression, the in vivo effects of pVNTR-S on warfarin metabolism cannot be separated from the effects of *3. Therefore, it is not necessary to consider pVNTR-S as an additional biomarker for warfarin dosing. Larger clinical studies are needed to define whether the pVNTR-S has a minimal effect in vivo, or whether the effect attributed to *3 is really a combination of effects on expression by the pVNTR-S along with effects on catalytic activity from the nonsynonymous *3 variant.
ABO incompatible (ABOi) kidney transplantation is an important modality to facilitate living donor transplant for incompatible pairs. To date, reports of the outcomes from this practice in the United States have been limited to single-center studies.
CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme that can not only generate cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose (cADPR) - a key Ca(2+) -mobilizing second messenger - by consuming NAD(+), but also hydrolyze extracellular NAD(+). There have been only a small number of studies on the functions of CD38 in the CNS. Brain inflammation plays critical roles in ischemic brain injury and multiple other neurological diseases, in which microglia activation is a key event. In this study we determined the roles of CD38 in the basal survival of mouse BV2 microglia cells by applying CD38 siRNA. Our study found that silencing of CD38 led to significantly decreased survival of the cells. We also found that decreased CD38 levels can lead to apoptosis of the microglial cells, as assessed by flow cytometry-based Annexin V/7-AAD assay, caspase-3 immunostaining and Hoechst staining assays. Our study has further indicated that the CD38 silencing-induced apoptosis is mainly caspase 3-dependent. Collectively, our study has provided the first evidence suggesting that CD38 plays a critical role in the basal survival of microglia, and decreased CD38 can lead to caspase 3-dependent apoptosis of the cells. These results suggest that CD38 may become a therapeutic target for modulating microglial survival in neurological diseases.
CD36 is a ubiquitous membrane glycoprotein that binds long-chain fatty acids. The presence of a functional CD36 is required for the induction of satiety by a lipid load and its role as a lipid receptor driving cellular signal has recently been demonstrated. Our project aimed to further explore the role of intestinal CD36 in the regulation of food intake. Duodenal infusions of vehicle or sulfo-N-succinimidyl-oleate (SSO) was performed prior to acute infusions of saline or Intralipid (IL) in mice. Infusion of minute quantities of IL induced a decrease in food intake (FI) compared to saline. Infusion of SSO had the same effect but no additive inhibitory effect was observed in presence of IL. No IL- or SSO-mediated satiety occurred in CD36-null mice. To determine whether the CD36-mediated hypophagic effect of lipids was maintained in animals fed a satietogen diet, mice were subjected to a High-Protein diet (HPD). Concomitantly with the satiety effect, a rise in intestinal CD36 gene expression was observed. No satiety effect occurred in CD36-null mice. HPD-fed WT mice showed a diminished FI compared to control mice, after saline duodenal infusion. But there was no further decrease after lipid infusion. The lipid-induced decrease in FI observed on control mice was accompanied by a rise in jejunal oleylethanolamide (OEA). Its level was higher in HPD-fed mice than in controls after saline infusion and was not changed by lipids. Overall, we demonstrate that lipid binding to intestinal CD36 is sufficient to produce a satiety effect. Moreover, it could participate in the satiety effect induced by HPD. Intestine can modulate FI by several mechanisms including an increase in OEA production and CD36 gene expression. Furthermore, intestine of mice adapted to HPD have a diminished capacity to modulate their food intake in response to dietary lipids.
CYP2D6 is an important cytochrome P450 enzyme. These enzymes catalyse the oxidative biotransformation of about 25% of clinically important drugs as well as the metabolism of numerous environmental chemical carcinogens. The most frequent null allele of CYP2D6 in European populations, CYP2D6*4, has been studied here in order to elucidate whether a relationship exists between this allele and the risk of developing breast cancer in a Spanish population.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of endometrial carcinoma. Sanger sequencing has been considered to be the gold standard for detection of PTEN sequence abnormalities. However, this approach fails to address the epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to functional PTEN loss. Using a study cohort of 154 endometrioid and non-endometrioid endometrial carcinomas, we performed full-length PTEN sequencing and PTEN immunohistochemistry on each tumor. PTEN sequence abnormalities were detected in a significantly lower proportion of cases (43%) than PTEN protein loss (64%, P=0.0004). Endometrioid tumors had a significantly higher proportion of PTEN sequence abnormalities and PTEN protein loss than non-endometrioid tumors. Within the latter group, PTEN sequence abnormalities and PTEN protein loss were most frequent in undifferentiated carcinomas, followed by mixed carcinomas; they were least frequent in carcinosarcomas. Overall, at least one PTEN sequence abnormality was detected in each exon, and the greatest number of sequence abnormalities was detected in exon 8. Pure-endometrioid tumors had a significantly higher frequency of sequence abnormalities in exon 7 than did the non-endometrioid tumors (P=0.0199). Importantly, no mutational hotspots were identified. While PTEN protein loss by immunohistochemistry was identified in 89% of cases with a PTEN sequence abnormality, PTEN protein loss was detected by immunohistochemistry in 44% of cases classified as PTEN wild type by sequencing. For the first time, we demonstrate that PTEN immunohistochemistry is able to identify the majority of cases with functional PTEN loss. However, PTEN immunohistochemistry also detects additional cases with PTEN protein loss that would otherwise be undetected by gene sequencing. Therefore, for clinical purposes, immunohistochemistry appears to be a preferable technique for identifying endometrial tumors with loss of PTEN function.
ABO incompatible (ABOi) heart transplantation is an accepted approach to increasing organ availability for young patients. Previous studies have suggested that early survival for ABOi transplants is similar to ABO compatible (ABOc) transplants. We analyzed the Pediatric Heart Transplant Study (PHTS) database from 1/96 to 12/08 to further assess this strategy.
CYP2C8 represents 7% of the hepatic cytochrome system and metabolizes around 5% of drugs in phase I processes. It also plays a significant role in metabolism of endogenous compounds. More than 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been noted, mainly in exons 3, 5, and 8. The most studied SNPs may lead to decreased enzyme activity and may have impact on drug metabolism. Variant alleles are called CYP2C8*2 (I269F), CYP2C8*3 (R139K, K399R), and CYP2C8*4(I264M). Our aim was to investigate the frequency of major functional SNPs among the Czech population.
CYP2A13 has been identified as an efficient catalyst for the metabolisms of coumarin, aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)), and several tobacco-specific carcinogens. The reported CYP2A13 polymorphisms with missense variations have been studied for their functional consequences, and CYP2A13*4 (R101Q) variant was found to be a null enzyme in metabolizing 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), AFB(1), and 5-methoxypsoralen. In the present study, CYP2A13*4 was expressed in Sf9 cells and evaluated for coumarin 7-hydroxylation activity. Our results demonstrated that CYP2A13*4 showed no activity in coumarin 7-hydroxylation. Furthermore, computer modeling studies were conducted to probe the mechanisms underlying the loss of catalytic activity of CYP2A13*4. The results suggested that the R101Q alteration may result in the absence of several hydrogen bonds involved in heme binding and thus lead to the loss of function in CYP2A13*4. In addition, for the first time, the distribution frequencies of all eight known CYP2A13 missense alleles were examined in a Chinese Han population. The distribution frequencies of CYP2A13*3 allele and CYP2A13*4 allele in the Chinese Han population were statistically significantly different from the reported values in Japanese. Considering that the two variants of CYP2A13 are incapable of metabolic activation of NNK and AFB(1), the susceptibility to NNK or AFB(1) exposure between the Chinese Han population and Japanese can be different.
PIK3CA mutations confer constitutive activation of PI3K, which initiates intracellular kinase signaling cascades that promote cell proliferation and survival. Recent studies by Meyer and colleagues, and Liu and colleagues demonstrate that expression of the H1047R exon 20 mutant of PIK3CA in luminal mammary epithelial cells induces tumorigenesis, implying that PIK3CA mutation is an early event in breast cancer. PIK3CA-H1047R-initiated tumors exhibit variable dependence on the oncogene and variable sensitivity to PI3K inhibition. Amplification of the oncogenes MYC and MET was observed in tumors that recurred following silencing of PIK3CA-H1047R, suggesting that these pathways represent mechanisms of escape from PI3K inhibition.
CP (capsular polysaccharide) is an important virulence factor during infections by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The enzyme CapF is an attractive therapeutic candidate belonging to the biosynthetic route of CP of pathogenic strains of S. aureus. In the present study, we report two independent crystal structures of CapF in an open form of the apoenzyme. CapF is a homodimer displaying a characteristic dumb-bell-shaped architecture composed of two domains. The N-terminal domain (residues 1-252) adopts a Rossmann fold belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family of proteins. The C-terminal domain (residues 252-369) displays a standard cupin fold with a Zn2+ ion bound deep in the binding pocket of the β-barrel. Functional and thermodynamic analyses indicated that each domain catalyses separate enzymatic reactions. The cupin domain is necessary for the C3-epimerization of UDP-4-hexulose. Meanwhile, the N-terminal domain catalyses the NADPH-dependent reduction of the intermediate species generated by the cupin domain. Analysis by ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry) revealed a fascinating thermodynamic switch governing the attachment and release of the coenzyme NADPH during each catalytic cycle. These observations suggested that the binding of coenzyme to CapF facilitates a disorder-to-order transition in the catalytic loop of the reductase (N-terminal) domain. We anticipate that the present study will improve the general understanding of the synthesis of CP in S. aureus and will aid in the design of new therapeutic agents against this pathogenic bacterium.
FABP7 has been implicated in tumour cell proliferation, cell migration, and poor prognosis in patients with high-grade astrocytoma and melanoma. In this study, we examine FABP7 expression in a cohort of 176 primary breast cancers by gene profiling and tissue microarray immunostaining. We show that FABP7 is significantly up-regulated in triple-negative breast cancer. Elevated FABP7 levels are associated with poor prognosis, absence of oestrogen and progesterone hormone receptors (ER, PR) and HER2, increased cell proliferation, and high tumour grade. Depletion of FABP7 in the ER/PR-negative cell line, MDA-MB-435S, significantly reduced cell growth rate and sensitized the cells to growth inhibition by omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A target of DHA-bound FABP7 in the nucleus is RXRβ, a retinoid-activated nuclear receptor that functions as a transcription factor by either homodimerizing or heterodimerizing with other nuclear receptors such as PPARs. Based on our microarray data, RXRβ, like FABP7, is an adverse prognostic factor for breast cancer. We propose that the DHA-FABP7-RXRβ pathway promotes cell survival/proliferation in triple-negative breast cancer. Targeting this pathway may thus provide an alternate route for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.
CYP4A11 (cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily A, polypeptide 11) converts arachidonic acid to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), which plays a crucial role in the modulation of cardiovascular homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between the human CYP4A11 gene and coronary artery disease (CAD).
AKR1B10 (aldo-keto reductase 1B10) is overexpressed in liver and lung cancer, and plays a critical role in tumour development and progression through promoting lipogenesis and eliminating cytotoxic carbonyls. AKR1B10 is a secretory protein and potential tumour marker; however, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of AKR1B10 expression. The present study showed that AKR1B10 is induced by mitogen EGF (epidermal growth factor) and insulin through the AP-1 (activator protein-1) signalling pathway. In human HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) cells (HepG2 and Hep3B), EGF (50 ng/ml) and insulin (10 nM) stimulated endogenous AKR1B10 expression and promoter activity. In the AKR1B10 promoter, a putative AP-1 element was found at bp -222 to -212. Deletion or mutation of this AP-1 element abrogated the basal promoter activity and response to EGF and AP-1 proteins. This AP-1 element bound to nuclear proteins extracted from HepG2 cells, and this binding was stimulated by EGF and insulin in a dose-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that the AP-1 proteins c-Fos and c-Jun were the predominant factors bound to the AP-1 consensus sequence, followed by JunD and then JunB. The same order was followed in the stimulation of endogenous AKR1B10 expression by AP-1 proteins. Furthermore, c-Fos shRNA (short hairpin RNA) and AP-1 inhibitors/antagonists (U0126 and Tanshinone IIA) inhibited endogenous AKR1B10 expression and promoter activity in HepG2 cells cultured in vitro or inoculated subcutaneously in nude mice. U0126 also inhibited AKR1B10 expression induced by EGF. Taken together, these results suggest that AKR1B10 is up-regulated by EGF and insulin through AP-1 mitogenic signalling and may be implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis.
PIK3CA is the oncogene showing the highest frequency of gain-of-function mutations in breast cancer, but the prognostic value of PIK3CA mutation status is controversial.
CP remains a challenging disease. Endoscopic and surgical management, along with antioxidants, have helped in reducing chronic pain. Management of exocrine and endocrine insufficiency forms the cornerstone for improving nutrition in these patients. Newer therapeutic targets that will transcend the management of CP beyond just pain control and enzyme supplementation are required in the future.
CYP3A5 was observed to be an important genetic contributor to inter individual differences in CYP3A-dependent drug metabolism in acute leukemic patients. Loss of CYP3A5 expression was mainly conferred by a single nucleotide polymorphism at 6986A>G (CYP3A5*3). We investigated the association between CYP3A5*3 polymorphism and acute leukemia.
PTEN loss or PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation correlates with human prostate cancer progression and metastasis. However, in preclinical murine models, deletion of Pten alone fails to mimic the significant metastatic burden that frequently accompanies the end stage of human disease. To identify additional pathway alterations that cooperate with PTEN loss in prostate cancer progression, we surveyed human prostate cancer tissue microarrays and found that the RAS/MAPK pathway is significantly elevated in both primary and metastatic lesions. In an attempt to model this event, we crossed conditional activatable K-ras(G12D/WT) mice with the prostate conditional Pten deletion model. Although RAS activation alone cannot initiate prostate cancer development, it significantly accelerated progression caused by PTEN loss, accompanied by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and macrometastasis with 100% penetrance. A novel stem/progenitor subpopulation with mesenchymal characteristics was isolated from the compound mutant prostates, which was highly metastatic upon orthotopic transplantation. Importantly, inhibition of RAS/MAPK signaling by PD325901, a mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-extracellular signal-regulated (ER) kinase (MEK) inhibitor, significantly reduced the metastatic progression initiated from transplanted stem/progenitor cells. Collectively, our findings indicate that activation of RAS/MAPK signaling serves as a potentiating second hit to alteration of the PTEN/PI3K/AKT axis, and cotargeting both the pathways is highly effective in preventing the development of metastatic prostate cancers.
ABO blood type antigens are expressed not only on human red blood cells, but also throughout the gastrointestinal tract and in normal pancreatic tissue. Previous studies have identified an association between ABO blood type and various malignancies. We analyzed the association of ABO blood type with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) in a high-risk cohort of patients with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome.
MTHFR polymorphisms C677T and A1298C are associated with reduced MTHFR enzyme activity and hyperhomocysteinemia, which has been associated with osteoporosis. The A163G polymorphism in osteoprotegerin (OPG) has been studied in osteoporosis with controversial results. The objective of the present study was to investigate the association(s) among MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, and OPG A163G polymorphisms in Mexican patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. The femoral neck and lumbar spine bone mineral densities (BMDs) were measured in 71 RA patients, and genotyping for the three polymorphisms was performed via restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Patients with osteoporosis/osteopenia exhibited statistically significant differences in the genotype frequencies of MTHFR C677T as well as an association with femoral neck BMD; TT homozygotes had lower BMDs than patients with the CT genotype, and both of these groups had lower BMDs than patients with the CC genotype. The associations of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism with osteoporosis/osteopenia and femoral neck BMD suggest that these polymorphisms confer a risk of developing osteoporosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a risk that may be reduced with folate and B complex supplementation.
MTHFD1 encodes C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase, which is a folate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the formation and interconversion of folate-activated one-carbon groups for nucleotide biosynthesis and cellular methylation. A polymorphism in MTHFD1 (1958G→A) impairs enzymatic activity and is associated with increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, but the mechanisms are unknown.
CA3 pyramidal neurons are important for memory formation and pattern completion in the hippocampal network. It is generally thought that proximal synapses from the mossy fibers activate these neurons most efficiently, whereas distal inputs from the perforant path have a weaker modulatory influence. We used confocally targeted patch-clamp recording from dendrites and axons to map the activation of rat CA3 pyramidal neurons at the subcellular level. Our results reveal two distinct dendritic domains. In the proximal domain, action potentials initiated in the axon backpropagate actively with large amplitude and fast time course. In the distal domain, Na(+) channel-mediated dendritic spikes are efficiently initiated by waveforms mimicking synaptic events. CA3 pyramidal neuron dendrites showed a high Na(+)-to-K(+) conductance density ratio, providing ideal conditions for active backpropagation and dendritic spike initiation. Dendritic spikes may enhance the computational power of CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal network.
AKR1A1 or aldehyde reductase is a member of the aldo-keto reductases superfamily that is evolutionarily conserved among species. AKR1A1 is one of the five AKRs (AKR1A1 and 1C1-1C4) implicated in the metabolic benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) activation to reactive BaP 7,8-dione. BaP is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) widely distributed in aquatic ecosystems and its metabolic activation is necessary to produce its toxic effects. Although the presence of AKR1A1 in fish has been reported, its tissue distribution in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and AKR1A1 inducibility by BaP are not known yet. Moreover, cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) mRNA expression in fish has been used as a PAH biomarker of effect. Therefore, BaP effects on AKR1A1 and CYP1A gene expressions in tilapia, a species of commercial interest, were investigated by real-time RT-PCR. A partial AKR1A1 cDNA was identified, sequenced and compared with AKR1A1 reported sequences in the GenBank DNA database. Constitutive AKR1A1 mRNA expression was detected mainly in liver, similarly to that of CYP1A. BaP exposure resulted in statistically significant AKR1A1 and CYP1A mRNA induction in liver (20- and 120-fold, respectively) at 24 h. On the other hand, ethoxyquin (EQ) was used as control inducer for AKR1A1 mRNA. Interestingly, EQ also induced CYP1A mRNA levels in tilapia liver. Our results suggest that teleost AKR1A1, in addition to CYP1A, are inducible by BaP. The mechanism of AKR1A1 induction by BaP and its role in fish susceptibility to BaP toxic effects remains to be elucidated.
CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are the most important drug-metabolizing enzymes. For several drugs, heteroactivation of CYP3A-mediated reactions has been demonstrated in vitro. In vivo data suggested a possible acute activation of CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam metabolism by efavirenz. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of efavirenz on the in vitro metabolism of midazolam. The formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam was studied in pooled human liver microsomes (HLM) and recombinant human CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 (rCYP3A4 and rCYP3A5) in the presence of efavirenz (0.5, 1, and 5 μM). Product formation rates (V(max)) increased with increasing efavirenz concentrations (∼1.5-fold increase at 5 μM efavirenz in HLM and ∼1.4-fold in rCYP3A4). The activation in rCYP3A4 was dependent on cytochrome b5, and the activating effect was also observed in rCYP3A5 supplemented with cytochrome b5, where Vmax was ∼1.3-fold enhanced. Concomitant inhibition of CYP3A activity with ketoconazole in HLM abolished the increase in the 1'-hydroxymidazolam formation rate, further confirming involvement of CYP3A. The results of this study represent a distinct acute activation of midazolam metabolism and support the in vivo observations. Moreover, only efavirenz, but not its major metabolite 8-hydroxyefavirenz, was responsible for the activation. The increase in 1'-hydroxymidazolam formation may have been caused by binding of efavirenz to a peripheral site of the enzyme, leading to enhanced midazolam turnover due to changes at the active site.
SPR biosensing is increasingly popular for the detection of a multitude of biomolecules. It offers label-free detection and study of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules in real time. A recent trend involves incorporation of AuNPs, either within the sensing surface itself or as signal enhancing tagging molecules. The importance of AuNP and detecting agent spacing is described and techniques using macromolecular spacing aids are highlighted. Recent methods to enhance SPR detection capabilities using gold nanoparticles are reviewed, as well as device fabrication and the results of incorporation. SPR detection is a highly versatile method for the detection of biomolecules and, with the incorporation of AuNPs, shows promise in extending it to a number of new applications.
PC cell-derived growth factor (PCDGF) is an autocrine growth factor originally purified from the highly tumorigenic teratoma PC cell line. It participates in tumorigenesis and tumour progression through upregulation of cyclin D1. To date, there has been no report on the role of PCDGF in skin cancer, to our knowledge.
IDO1 can be induced by interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in multiple cell types. We have earlier described that the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor zebularine also induces IDO1 in several rat cell clones. We now describe a synergistic induction of IDO1 expression by IFN-γ and zebularine. To elucidate the mechanism of the IDO1 induction we have studied the methylation status in the promoter region of the IDO1 gene from both human monocytic THP-1 cells and H1D2 rat colon cancer cells. Interestingly, the IDO1 promoter is hypermethylated and IFN-γ is shown to induce a significant demethylation. The synergism in effect of zebularine and IFN-γ on IDO1 expression is paralleled by a similar synergistic effect on expression of two other IFN-γ-responsive genes, the transcription factors STAT1 and IRF1 with binding sites in the IDO1 promoter region. The demonstrated synergistic activation of IDO1 expression has implications in relation to therapeutic induction of immunosuppression in autoimmunity and chronic inflammation.
RRM1 and ERCC1 overexpression has been extensively investigated as potential predictive markers of tumor sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy agents, most thoroughly in lung cancer. However, data in pancreatic cancer are scarce.
"PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) presents in a spectrum that encompasses the eponymous disorders Cowden and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba. Herein, we delineate the distinctive histopathology of a predominantly intramuscular lesion in PHTS, often called ""arteriovenous malformation,"" because of certain imaging and histopathologic features. Cases were identified by review of lesions resected from patients with PHTS registered at our Vascular Anomalies Center and of unusual intramuscular vascular anomalies in our pathology database from 1985 to 2008. Thirty-four patients with this lesion were identified: 20 had a clinical diagnosis of, or were suspected to have, PHTS (genetically confirmed in 16). In 4 patients without clinical manifestations of PHTS, 2 had PTEN mutations, 1 did not, and in 1 the mutation was intronic. In the remaining 10, there was insufficient clinical information to fully assess whether they had manifestations of PHTS. Lesions manifested by 15 years of age, normally with pain and swelling, and were most often located in the lower extremity. The major mass was usually intramuscular, but often there were fascial and subcutaneous components and not infrequently a cutaneous vascular stain. Magnetic resonance imaging generally showed an infiltrative soft tissue lesion involving the muscle, fascia, and subcutis with frequently enlarged, serpiginous vessels, small arteriovenous fistulae with disproportionately dilated draining veins, and a prominent adipocytic component. Some lesions involved contiguous muscles, and 20% were multifocal. Resected specimens ranged in size from 1.2 to 25 cm; in 1 patient, amputation was necessary. Histopathologically, these unencapsulated masses, often with a nodular appearance at scanning magnification, consisted of: (1) a variable admixture of mature adipocytic and dense and/or myxoid fibrous tissues (50% to 90% of surface area); (2) a vascular component (10% to 50% of surface area) with: (a) clusters of venous channels, some with excessively and irregularly muscularized complex walls and lumens, and others with thin walls resembling pulmonary alveoli, (b) tortuous, thick-walled arteries with concentric muscular hyperplasia and relatively small lumens, (c) numerous small vessels (arteries, veins, and indeterminate channels), and (d) occasional arteriovenous communications; (3) lymphoid follicles (50%); (4) foci of bone (20%); and (5) hypertrophic nerves with ""onion bulb"" proliferation of periaxonal spindled cells (9%). We designate this disorganized overgrowth of essentially mesenchymal elements as PTEN hamartoma of soft tissue. It differs from other vascular and connective tissue lesions that occur in patients with PHTS. PTEN hamartoma of soft tissue is histopathologically distinctive, and its identification should prompt a thorough investigation for PHTS."
ABCG2 plays a major role in anticancer-drug efflux and related tumor multidrug resistance. Potent and selective ABCG2 inhibitors with low cytotoxicity were investigated among a series of 44 chalcones and analogues (1,3-diarylpropenones), by evaluating their inhibitory effect on the transport of mitoxantrone, a known ABCG2 substrate. Six compounds producing complete inhibition with IC(50) values below 0.5 μM and high selectivity for ABCG2 were identified. The number and position of methoxy substituents appeared to be critical for both inhibition and cytotoxicity. The best compounds, with potent inhibition and low toxicity, contained an N-methyl-1-indolyl (compound 38) or a 6'-hydroxyl-2',4'-dimethoxy-1-phenyl (compound 27) moiety (A-ring) and two methoxy groups at positions 2 and 6 of the 3-phenyl moiety (B-ring). Methoxy substitution contributed to inhibition at positions 3 and 5, but had a negative effect at position 4. Finally, methoxy groups at positions 3, 4, and 5 of the B-ring markedly increased cytotoxicity and, therefore, should be avoided.
ABO antigens are oligosaccharide antigens, and are widely distributed on red blood and tissue cells as well as in saliva and body fluid. Therefore, these antigens are important not only for blood transfusion, but also for tissue cell and organ transplantations. Also, blood, hair, and seminal fluid are important sources of evidence at crime scenes, and these antigens are some of the most important markers for personal identification in forensic investigations. Here, we describe the development and use of quantitative analysis of A, B, and H antigens on red blood cells by employing flow cytometric analysis and the ABO genotyping method based on PCR-amplification of specific alleles (PASA) within DNA, especially from blood and saliva. In this study, flow cytometric analysis could be used to compare the differences between the expression of A and/or B and H antigens on red blood cells with various phenotypes, and the PASA method was able to determine the genotype of the type cisA(2)B(3) pedigree using only DNA extracted from saliva. These analysis methods are simple and useful for judging the ABO blood group system and genotyping, and are used widely throughout research and clinical laboratories and forensic fields.
SPHK1 expression is elevated in gastric cancer and is associated with shorter survival times for patients. However, the molecular mechanism of SPHK1 up-regulation in gastric cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we report that miR-124 down-regulated SPHK1 expression by directly targeting its 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and that miR-124 expression was inversely correlated with SPHK1 expression in gastric cancer samples. Furthermore, we demonstrated that, similar to the effect of silencing SPHK1, up-regulation of miR-124 markedly inhibited proliferation and tumourigenicity of gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. This was found to be mechanistically associated with induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21$^{{\rm Cip1}}$ and p27$^{{\rm Kip1}}$, enhancement of the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 and suppression of AKT activity. Moreover, we showed that the re-introduction of SPHK1 (without the 3'-UTR), but not with the 3'-UTR, could abrogate the miR-124-mediated induction of p21$^{{\rm Cip1}}$ and p27$^{{\rm Kip1}}$, as well as rescue the miR-124-induced proliferation inhibition. Together, these results suggest that miR-124 has an important role in the suppression of gastric cancer and presents a novel mechanism of miRNA-mediated SPHK1 expression in cancer cells.
FH (Factor H) with 20 SCR (short complement regulator) domains is a major serum regulator of complement, and genetic defects in this are associated with inflammatory diseases. Heparan sulfate is a cell-surface glycosaminoglycan composed of sulfated S-domains and unsulfated NA-domains. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of binding of FH to glycosaminoglycans, we performed ultracentrifugation, X-ray scattering and surface plasmon resonance with FH and glycosaminoglycan fragments. Ultracentrifugation showed that FH formed up to 63% of well-defined oligomers with purified heparin fragments (equivalent to S-domains), and indicated a dissociation constant K(d) of approximately 0.5 μM. Unchanged FH structures that are bivalently cross-linked at SCR-7 and SCR-20 with heparin explained the sedimentation coefficients of the FH-heparin oligomers. The X-ray radius of gyration, R(G), of FH in the presence of heparin fragments 18-36 monosaccharide units long increased significantly from 10.4 to 11.7 nm, and the maximum lengths of FH increased from 35 to 40 nm, confirming that large compact oligomers had formed. Surface plasmon resonance of immobilized heparin with full-length FH gave K(d) values of 1-3 μM, and similar but weaker K(d) values of 4-20 μM for the SCR-6/8 and SCR-16/20 fragments, confirming co-operativity between the two binding sites. The use of minimally-sulfated heparan sulfate fragments that correspond largely to NA-domains showed much weaker binding, proving the importance of S-domains for this interaction. This bivalent and co-operative model of FH binding to heparan sulfate provides novel insights on the immune function of FH at host cell surfaces.
ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) treatment effectively inhibits proteinuria and ameliorates the course of various renal diseases. In experimental glomerulonephritis, however, angiotensin II (AngII) infusion has also been shown to be renoprotective. We evaluated the long-term (28 days) course of anti-Thy1 glomerulonephritis in animals with suppressed AngII formation by ACE-I treatment.
PTEN is an important tumour suppressor gene that is mutated in Cowden syndrome as well as various sporadic cancers. CpG island hypermethylation is another route to tumour suppressor gene inactivation, however, the literature regarding PTEN hypermethylation in cancer is controversial. Furthermore, investigation of the methylation status of the PTEN CpG island is challenging due to sequence homology with the PTEN pseudogene, PTENP1. PTEN shares a CpG island promoter with another gene known as KLLN. Here we present a thorough reinvestigation of the methylation status of the PTEN CpG island in DNA from colorectal, breast, ovarian, glioma, lung and haematological cancer cell lines.
ABCD2 (D2) is a peroxisomal transporter that is highly abundant in adipose tissue and promotes the oxidation of long-chain MUFA. Erucic acid (EA, 22:1ω9) reduces very long chain saturated fatty acids in patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy but promotes dyslipidemia and dilated cardiomyopathy in rats. To determine the role of D2 in the metabolism of EA, we challenged wild-type and D2 deficient mice (D2 KO) with an enriched EA diet. In D2 KO mice, dietary EA resulted in the rapid expansion of adipose tissue, adipocyte hypertrophy, hepatic steatosis, and the loss of glycemic control. However, D2 had no impact on the development of obesity phenotypes in two models of diet-induced obesity. Although there was a significant increase in EA in liver of D2 KO mice, it constituted less than 2% of all fatty acids. Metabolites of EA (20:1, 18:1, and 16:1) were elevated, particularly 18:1, which accounted for 50% of all fatty acids. These data indicate that the failure to metabolize EA in adipose results in hepatic metabolism of EA, disruption of the fatty acid profile, and the development of obesity and reveal an essential role for D2 in the protection from dietary EA.
ABCG2 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily, and its overexpression causes multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer chemotherapy. ABCG2 may also protect cancer stem cells by extruding cytotoxic materials. ABCG2 has previously been shown to exist as a high-order homo-oligomer consisting of possibly 8-12 subunits, and the oligomerization domain was mapped to the C-terminal domain, including TM5, ECL3, and TM6. In this study, we further investigate this domain in detail for the role of each segment in the oligomerization and drug transport function of ABCG2 using domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis. We found that none of the three segments (TM5, TM6, and ECL3) is essential for the oligomerization activity of ABCG2 and that any one of these three segments in the full-length context is sufficient to support ABCG2 oligomerization. While TM5 plays an important role in the drug transport function of ABCG2, TM6 and ECL3 are replaceable. Thus, each segment in the TM5-ECL3-TM6 domain plays a distinctive role in the oligomerization and function of ABCG2.
CD36 is a membrane glycoprotein, contributing to the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders, like obesity, which has become a major health concern worldwide.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene in different cancers. This study was to determine the protein expression of PTEN and phosphorylation of PTEN (p-PTEN) at residue Ser380 in different histology specimens of gastric tissues.
CFTR expression studies contribute in understanding the relationship between CFTR transcripts and clinical outcomes. Normalization of qPCR data is an essential step to determine target gene expression. Consequently, appropriate reference genes must be selected for each gene/tissue. In this work, we have assessed the suitability of four potential reference genes for CFTR expression analysis in nasal epithelium.
IDO2 is a newly discovered enzyme with 43 % similarity to classical IDO (IDO1) protein and shares the same critical catalytic residues. IDO1 catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in the degradation of tryptophan and is a key enzyme in mediating tumor immune tolerance via arrest of T cell proliferation. The role of IDO2 in human T cell immunity remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate that similar to IDO1, IDO2 also degrades tryptophan into kynurenine and is inhibited more efficiently by Levo-1-methyl tryptophan (L-1MT), an IDO1 competitive inhibitor, than by dextro-methyl tryptophan (D-1MT). Although IDO2 enzyme activity is weaker than IDO1, it is less sensitive to 1-MT inhibition than IDO1. Moreover, our results indicate that human CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell proliferation was inhibited by IDO2, but both L-1MT and D-1MT could not reverse IDO2-mediated arrest of cell proliferation, even at high concentrations. These data indicate that IDO2 is an inhibitory mechanism in human T cell proliferation and support efforts to develop more effective IDO1 and IDO2 inhibitors in order to overcome IDO-mediated immune tolerance.
ABCC2 (MRP2, cMOAT) expression has been implicated in cisplatin resistance in vitro. In mice, cisplatin disposition and toxicity were unaffected by Abcc2 knockout (Abcc2−/−). Moreover, in cancer patients (n = 237), cisplatin pharmacokinetics (P > 0.12) and efficacy (P > 0.41) were not associated with seven of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABCC2. These SNPs were also not correlated with ABCC2 expression in the NCI60 panel (P > 0.26) or with cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity (P = 0.21). These findings highlight the importance of verifying drug-transporter interactions with in vitro tests in humans.
CYP2C9 is a microsomal cytochrome P450 that receives electrons from P450 oxidoreductase (POR) to metabolize about 15% of clinically used drugs. Similar to many P450 enzymes, CYP2C9 is polymorphic, with the hypomorphic *2 and *3 variants accounting for about 20% of White alleles. POR is also polymorphic, with the amino acid sequence variant A503V accounting for 19-37% of alleles in different populations. We aimed to understand how polymorphisms in these two interacting proteins might affect drug metabolism.
TAT (a 13-mer derived from the HIV-1 Tat protein)-linked cell-permeable peptides deliver plasma membrane impermeable cargos into the cell. We investigated the effect of a TAT-linked intracellular third loop of the endothelin-1 type B receptor on endothelin-1 activation of ERK. The effect of this peptide on ERK activation was determined in ETB receptor cDNA-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and in ETA- and ETB-expressing human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells obtained from a normal and a bone morphogenetic protein-2 receptor, exon 1-8 deletion subject, with pulmonary hypertension. In the Chinese hamster ovary cells the peptide, at optimum 10 μm concentration, suppressed endothelin-1 activation. In the normal human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, the peptide marginally enhanced endothelin-1 activation of ERK. However, it markedly enhanced the endothelin-1 activation of ERK in the bone morphogenetic protein-2 receptor human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. While the effective concentration for endothelin-1 activation of ERK remained unchanged in the bone morphogenetic protein-2 receptor human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, the number of ETB receptors declined by 2/3. These data point to the intracellular third loop peptide as having variable receptor interactive effects with both signal repressive and enhancing capabilities. Peptides that can alter endothelin-1 signal capabilities are potentially important in the study and treatment of pulmonary hypertension.
WWOX has been shown to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene in numerous human cancers. The objective of this study is to determine the expression of WWOX in human renal cell carcinoma tumor cells and its possible correlation with clinical outcome.
FABP7 is a member of the multi-gene fatty acid binding protein family. It is expressed in the mammary gland and has been shown to function as inhibitor of proliferation of breast tumour cells and to promote differentiation through the JAK/Stat pathway. Cytoplasmic FABP7 expression has been shown to be associated with a favourable prognosis of basal-like breast cancer. In other tissues, varying sub-cellular localization of FABP7 between the nucleus and cytoplasm has been observed. Tissue microarray preparations of well-characterized series of 1,249 unselected and 245 ER-negative invasive breast cancers with a long-term follow-up were investigated in this study to assess the biological and clinical significance of FABP7 sub-cellular localization using immunohistochemistry. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic FABP7 were observed. Nuclear FABP7 was associated with high histologic grade, mitotic frequency, pleomorphism and stage, in addition to basal phenotype (BP) and triple-negative (TN) phenotype. Nuclear FABP7 expression showed an association with expression of markers associated with proliferation and cell-cycle control including Ki67, p53 and p21; however, cytoplasmic FABP7 was associated only with Ki67 and P53 (P = 0.001, < 0.001 respectively). Interestingly, in multivariate analysis, nuclear FABP7 expression in BP was significantly associated with longer DFI (P = 0.025) independent of cytoplasmic expression. Tumours with only nuclear positive FABP7 expression had significantly better prognosis than those with only cytoplasmic expression. This is the first study elucidating the sub-cellular localization of FABP7 in a large series of breast cancer cases. Our observations demonstrate the considerable heterogeneity in expression patterns of FABP7 within breast cancer that relates to differences in biological behaviour especially in basal-like breast cancer. Further investigation of the biology of FABP7 in breast cancer is warranted.
OTC deficiency is a disorder of the urea cycle X-linked. It is manifested in men as severe hyperammonemia in the first days of life. In women the disease is milder severity. Various conditions cause decompensation with hyperammonemia. It could be fatal or cause permanent neurological damage. We report a 36 years old woman admitted for surgery, she suffered a decompensation in conjunction with surgical wound infection. Hyperammonemia caused neurological deterioration with decreased level of consciousness, tetraparesis and neurogenic dysphagia. The treatment consisting of low-protein diet, ammonium chelating drugs and dialytic measures, was effective in controlling hyperammonaemia and improving neurological status. This case illustrates the importance of nutritional support of patients with disorders of the urea cycle in the hospital because the descompensations are more frecuent here.
FIG4 is a ubiquitously expressed phosphatase that, in complex with FAB1/PIKFYVE and VAC14, regulates the biosynthesis of the signaling lipid PI(3,5)P(2). Null mutation of Fig4 in the mouse results in spongiform degeneration of brain and peripheral ganglia, defective myelination and juvenile lethality. Partial loss-of-function of human FIG4 results in a severe form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. Neurons from null mice contain enlarged vacuoles derived from the endosome/lysosome pathway, and astrocytes accumulate proteins involved in autophagy. Other cellular defects include astrogliosis and microgliosis. To distinguish the contributions of neurons and glia to spongiform degeneration in the Fig4 null mouse, we expressed Fig4 under the control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter and the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter in transgenic mice. Neuronal expression of Fig4 was sufficient to rescue cellular and neurological phenotypes including spongiform degeneration, gliosis and juvenile lethality. In contrast, expression of Fig4 in astrocytes prevented accumulation of autophagy markers and microgliosis but did not prevent spongiform degeneration or lethality. To confirm the neuronal origin of spongiform degeneration, we generated a floxed allele of Fig4 and crossed it with mice expressing the Cre recombinase from the neuron-specific synapsin promoter. Mice with conditional inactivation of Fig4 in neurons developed spongiform degeneration and the full spectrum of neurological abnormalities. The data demonstrate that expression of Fig4 in neurons is necessary and sufficient to prevent spongiform degeneration. Therapy for patients with FIG4 deficiency will therefore require correction of the deficiency in neurons.
PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder with increased risks of neoplasias, macrocephaly, and developmental disabilities. While both familial and sporadic cases exist, actual de novo mutation frequency remains unknown. We sought to estimate this within our PTEN-mutation positive patient series.
CYP2E1 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which is involved in the metabolism and activation of both endobiotics and xenobiotics. The genetic polymorphisms of CYP2E1 gene (Chromosome 10q26.3, Accession Number NC_000010.10) are reported to be related to the development of several mental diseases and to be involved in the clinical efficacy of some psychiatric medications. We investigated the possible association of CYP2E1 polymorphisms with susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Chinese Han Population as well as the relationship with response to risperidone in schizophrenia patients.
PTEN gene is considered one of the most mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancer, and it's likely to become the first one in the near future. Since 1997, its involvement in tumor suppression has smoothly increased, up to the current importance. Germline mutations of PTEN cause the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), which include the past-called Cowden, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba, Proteus, Proteus-like, and Lhermitte-Duclos syndromes. Somatic mutations of PTEN have been observed in glioblastoma, prostate cancer, and brest cancer cell lines, quoting only the first tissues where the involvement has been proven. The negative regulation of cell interactions with the extracellular matrix could be the way PTEN phosphatase acts as a tumor suppressor. PTEN gene plays an essential role in human development. A recent model sees PTEN function as a stepwise gradation, which can be impaired not only by heterozygous mutations and homozygous losses, but also by other molecular mechanisms, such as transcriptional regression, epigenetic silencing, regulation by microRNAs, posttranslational modification, and aberrant localization. The involvement of PTEN function in melanoma and multistage skin carcinogenesis, with its implication in cancer treatment, and the role of front office in diagnosing PHTS are the main reasons why the dermatologist should know about PTEN.
SLC26A3 functions as a chloride/bicarbonate anion exchanger expressed in the secretory epithelial cells in the intestine, pancreas, and salivary glands. SLC26A3 has a C-terminal class I PDZ binding motif that assembles regulatory factors or other transporters by anchoring to various PDZ scaffold proteins. NHERF4 is an epithelial-enriched PDZ domain scaffold protein that has attracted attention because of its enriched tissue expression in the intestine and kidney. In this study, we identified SLC26A3 as a novel binding transporter of NHERF4. We investigated the functional role of NHERF4 in the regulation of SLC26A3 by using integrated biochemical and physiological approaches. A direct protein-protein interaction was identified between the PDZ-binding motif of SLC26A3 and the third PDZ domain of NHERF4. Interaction with NHERF4 decreased the level of SLC26A3 expression on the plasma membrane, which led to reduced SLC26A3 anion exchange activity. Notably, interaction with NHERF4 induced rapid internalisation of SLC26A3 from the plasma membrane. The SLC26A3-NHERF4 interaction was modulated by phosphorylation; serine 329 of NHERF4-PDZ3 played a critical role in modulating binding selectivity. Our findings suggest that NHERF4 is a novel modulator of luminal fluidity in the intestine by adjusting SLC26A3 expression and activity through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism.
GNE myopathy is an autosomal recessive adult onset disorder caused by mutations in the GNE gene. GNE encodes the bifunctional enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetyl mannosamine kinase, the key enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway of sialic acid. Additional functions for GNE have been described recently, but the mechanism leading from GNE mutation to this myopathy is unclear. Therefore a gene therapy approach could address all potential defects caused by GNE mutations in muscle. We show that AAV8 viral vectors carrying wild type human GNE cDNA are able to transduce murine muscle cells and human GNE myopathy-derived muscle cells in culture and to express the transgene in these cells. Furthermore, the intravenous administration of this viral vector to healthy mice allows expression of the GNE transgene mRNA and of the coexpressed luciferase protein, for at least 6months in skeletal muscles, with no clinical or pathological signs of focal or general toxicity, neither from the virus particles nor from the wild type human GNE overexpression. Our results support the future use of an AAV8 based vector platform for a safe and efficient therapy of muscle in GNE myopathy.
CYP3A4 is one of the most important of all drug-metabolizing enzymes. Although several direct or indirect quantification methods have been proposed for the determination of the CYP3A4 activity, the sample preparation is mostly tedious and usually requires time consuming separate extraction steps and solid-phase extraction.
CD36 is recognized as a lipid and fatty acid receptor and plays an important role in the metabolic syndrome and associated cardiac events. The pleiotropic activity and the multiple molecular associations of this scavenger receptor with membrane associated molecules in different cells and tissues have however questioned its potential as a therapeutic target. The present study shows that it is possible to identify low molecular weight chemicals that can block the CD36 binding and uptake functions. These inhibitors were able to reduce arterial lipid deposition, fatty acid intestinal transit, plasma concentration of triglycerides and glucose, to improve insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance and to reduce the plasma concentration of HbAc1 in different and independent rodent models. Correlation between the anti-CD36 activity of these inhibitors and the known pathophysiological activity of this scavenger receptor in the development of atherosclerosis and diabetes were observed at pharmacological doses. Thus, CD36 might represent an attractive therapeutic target.
PTEN germline mutations are found in a small subset of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and accompanying macrocephaly. In this review, we discuss recent advances that offer insight into the pathogenesis of this subgroup of autism patients. We provide an overview of how disrupting PTEN function influences neuronal cells, and describe efforts to decipher the cellular mechanisms associated with altered social behaviors. We discuss the PTEN downstream signaling pathways that likely mediate these cellular and behavioral effects. In addition, emerging data suggest that PTEN mutation can synergize with mutations in other autism susceptibility genes to contribute to the development of autistic behaviors. These studies extend our knowledge of PTEN and the PTEN signaling pathway, and offer molecular and cellular clues to better understand the etiology of ASDs.
CYP2D6 is genotyped clinically for prediction of response to tamoxifen, psychotropic drugs and other medications. Phenotype prediction is dependent upon accurate genotyping. The CYP Allele Nomenclature Committee maintains the allelic nomenclature for CYP2D6; however, in some cases, the list of polymorphisms associated with a given allele is incomplete. Clinical laboratories and in vitro diagnostic manufacturers rely upon this nomenclature, in addition to the literature, to infer allelic function and haplotypes and when they design CYP2D6-testing platforms. This article provides more complete sequencing data for the CYP2D6*11 allele and describes the difficulties encountered in genotyping CYP2D6 when incomplete data are available. The CYP Allele Nomenclature Committee should provide clear information about the completeness of the original data used to define each allele.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) is one of the most frequently lost tumor suppressor genes in human cancers and it has been described in more than two-thirds of patients with advanced/aggressive prostate cancer. Previous studies suggest that, in prostate cancer, genomic PTEN loss is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Thus, we evaluated whether immunohistochemical PTEN expression in prostate cancer glands was associated with higher risk of recurrence, using a nested case-control study that included 451 men who recurred and 451 men who did not recur with clinically localized prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy. Recurrence was defined as biochemical recurrence (serum prostate-specific antigen >0.2 ng/ml) or clinical recurrence (local recurrence, systemic metastases, or prostate cancer-related death). Cases and controls were matched on pathological T stage, Gleason score, race/ethnicity, and age at surgery. Odds ratios of recurrence and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using conditional logistic regression to account for the matching factors and to adjust for year of surgery, preoperative prostate-specific antigen concentrations, and status of surgical margins. Men who recurred had a higher proportion of PTEN negative expression (16 vs 11%, P=0.05) and PTEN loss (40 vs 31%, P=0.02) than controls. Men with markedly decreased PTEN staining had a higher risk of recurrence (odds ratio=1.67; 95% confidence intervals 1.09, 2.57; P=0.02) when compared with all other men. In summary, in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated by prostatectomy, decreased PTEN expression was associated with an increased risk of recurrence, independent of known clinicopathological factors.
NPR1 (a non-expressor of pathogenesis-related genes1) has been reported to play an important role in plant defense by regulating signaling pathways. However, little to nothing is known about its function in herbivore-induced defense in monocot plants. Here, using suppressive substrate hybridization, we identified a NPR1 gene from rice, OsNPR1, and found that its expression levels were upregulated in response to infestation by the rice striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis and rice leaf folder (LF) Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, and to mechanical wounding and treatment with jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA). Moreover, mechanical wounding induced the expression of OsNPR1 quickly, whereas herbivore infestation induced the gene more slowly. The antisense expression of OsNPR1 (as-npr1), which reduced the expression of the gene by 50%, increased elicited levels of JA and ethylene (ET) as well as of expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an ACC synthase gene OsACS2. The enhanced JA and ET signaling in as-npr1 plants increased the levels of herbivore-induced trypsin proteinase inhibitors (TrypPIs) and volatiles, and reduced the performance of SSB. Our results suggest that OsNPR1 is an early responding gene in herbivore-induced defense and that plants can use it to activate a specific and appropriate defense response against invaders by modulating signaling pathways.
CD36 is a widely expressed cell surface receptor, that among other ligands binds lipoproteins, and its function has been implicated in many of the complications belonging to the metabolic syndrome. We have previously identified a circulating form of CD36 and established an in-house ELISA assay for measurement of CD36 in plasma. Plasma CD36 was elevated in insulin resistant obese and diabetic patients, and in patients with unstable atherosclerotic plaques. The objective of this study was to compare two new commercial CD36 ELISA assays and our in-house ELISA assay.
AK1 (Adenylate Kinase 1) plays crucial roles in processes such as cellular phosphotransfer networks, neuronal maturation and regeneration, gating of ABC transporter CFTR, tumor cell metabolism and myocardial energetic homeostasis. Here we report (1)H, (15)N and (13)C backbone and side-chain resonance assignments of the human AK1 protein in apo form. This work lays the essential basis for the further structure determination of hAK1. 
ABCG2 is an ATP-dependent efflux transporter that limits the systemic exposure of its substrates. The preferred substrates of ABCG2 in vivo are largely unknown. We aimed to identify the compounds transported by ABCG2 under physiological conditions. In vitro, ABCG2 transports several sulfate conjugates at high rates. We therefore used targeted metabolomics, specifically detecting compounds conjugated to sulfate, to search in plasma, urine, and bile samples of wild-type and Abcg2-/- mice for differentially present compounds, which are likely to represent in vivo ABCG2 substrates. Levels of many sulfate conjugates were up to 15-fold higher in plasma and urine of Abcg2-/- than of wild-type mice, with the opposite effect seen in bile. These differentially present compounds were identified as the sulfate conjugates of phytoestrogens, compounds with weak pro- or antiestrogenic properties. We confirmed that these sulfate conjugates were ABCG2 substrates using transportomics, a method that uses vesicular transport assays to screen for substrates of ABC transporters in body fluids. In conclusion, our results show that ABCG2 limits the systemic exposure to many different phytoestrogens, a class of compounds to which mammals are exposed on a daily basis via food of plant origin, by directing their sulfate conjugates for excretion via the feces.
MTHFR polymorphisms have been implicated as risk factors for several cancers. Studies have conducted on the associations of MTHFR polymorphisms with cervical carcinoma risk and have generated inconclusive results. The aim of the present study was to increase power demonstrating the possible relations. Meta-analyses examining the association between MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and cervical carcinoma risk were performed. Separate analyses on ethnicity and source of controls were also implemented. Eligible studies were identified for the period up to Dec 2011. Eleven case-control studies containing 1859 cases and 2562 controls regarding MTHFR C677T polymorphisms were selected, of which four studies containing 461 cases and 832 controls described A1298C polymorphisms. For the overall data, no associations of MTHFR C677T polymorphisms with cervical carcinoma were observed (TT vs CC: OR = 1.07; 95 %CI = 0.73-1.58; dominant model: OR = 0.89; 95 %CI = 0.66-1.18; recessive model: OR = 1.13; 95 %CI = 0.84-1.52). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, MTHFR 677T allele was associated with decreased cervical cancer susceptibility among Caucasians (TT vs CC: OR = 0.65; 95 %CI = 0.45-0.93; dominant model: OR = 0.70; 95 %CI = 0.58-0.86) but not Asians. As for A1298C polymorphism, no marked associations of A1298C genetic variation with cervical cancer risk were observed (CC vs AA: OR = 1.01; 95 %CI = 0.60-1.73; dominant model: OR = 1.17; 95 %CI = 0.91-1.49; recessive model: OR = 0.99; 95 %CI = 0.60-1.63). Collectively, the results of the present study suggest that MTHFR 677T allele might play a preventive role for cervical carcinoma among Caucasians. A1298C polymorphisms might exert little effect on cervical cancerigenesis.
ABCG5 and ABCG8 form a complex (G5G8) that opposes the absorption of plant sterols but is also expressed in liver where it promotes the excretion of cholesterol into bile. Hepatic G5G8 is transcriptionally regulated by a number of factors implicated in the development of insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Therefore, we hypothesized that G5G8 may influence the development of diet-induced obesity phenotypes independently of its role in opposing phytosterol absorption. G5G8 knock-out (KO) mice and their wild type (WT) littermates were challenged with a plant sterol-free low fat or high fat (HF) diet. Weight gain and the rise in fasting glucose were accelerated in G5G8 KO mice following HF feeding. HF-fed G5G8 KO mice had increased liver weight, hepatic lipids, and plasma alanine aminotransferase compared with WT controls. Consistent with the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, macrophage infiltration, the number of TUNEL-positive cells, and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines were also increased in G5G8 KO mice. Hepatic lipid accumulation was associated with increased peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ, CD36, and fatty acid uptake. Phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eiF2α) and expression of activating transcription factor 4 and tribbles 3 were elevated in HF-fed G5G8 KO mice, a pathway that links the unfolded protein response to the development of insulin resistance through inhibition of protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Akt and insulin receptor was reduced, whereas serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 was elevated.
"CA1 pyramidal neurons receive hundreds of synaptic inputs at different distances from the soma. Distance-dependent synaptic scaling enables distal and proximal synapses to influence the somatic membrane equally, a phenomenon called ""synaptic democracy"". How this is established is unclear. The backpropagating action potential (BAP) is hypothesised to provide distance-dependent information to synapses, allowing synaptic strengths to scale accordingly. Experimental measurements show that a BAP evoked by current injection at the soma causes calcium currents in the apical shaft whose amplitudes decay with distance from the soma. However, in vivo action potentials are not induced by somatic current injection but by synaptic inputs along the dendrites, which creates a different excitable state of the dendrites. Due to technical limitations, it is not possible to study experimentally whether distance information can also be provided by synaptically-evoked BAPs. Therefore we adapted a realistic morphological and electrophysiological model to measure BAP-induced voltage and calcium signals in spines after Schaffer collateral synapse stimulation. We show that peak calcium concentration is highly correlated with soma-synapse distance under a number of physiologically-realistic suprathreshold stimulation regimes and for a range of dendritic morphologies. Peak calcium levels also predicted the attenuation of the EPSP across the dendritic tree. Furthermore, we show that peak calcium can be used to set up a synaptic democracy in a homeostatic manner, whereby synapses regulate their synaptic strength on the basis of the difference between peak calcium and a uniform target value. We conclude that information derived from synaptically-generated BAPs can indicate synapse location and can subsequently be utilised to implement a synaptic democracy."
"RPE cells are involved in the pathogenesis of many retinal diseases. Accurate analysis of RPE gene expression profiles in different scenarios will increase our understanding of disease mechanisms. Our objective in this study was to develop an improved method for the isolation of RPE cells, specifically for RNA analysis. Mouse RPE cells were isolated using different techniques, including mechanical dissociation techniques and a new technique we refer to here as ""Simultaneous RPE cell Isolation and RNA Stabilization"" (SRIRS method). RNA was extracted from the RPE cells. An RNA bioanalyzer was used to determine the quantity and quality of RNA. qPCR was used to determine contamination with non-RPE-derived RNA. Several parameters with a potential impact on the isolation protocol were studied and optimized. A marked improvement in the quantity and quality of RPE-derived RNA was obtained with the SRIRS technique. We could get the RPE in direct contact with the RNA protecting agent within 1 min of enucleation, and the RPE isolated within 11 min of enucleation. There was no significant contamination with vascular, choroidal or scleral-derived RNA. We have developed a fast, easy and reliable method for the isolation of RPE cells that leads to a high yield of RPE-derived RNA while preserving its quality. We believe this technique will be useful for future studies looking at gene expression profiles of RPE cells and their role in the pathophysiology of retinal diseases."
PIK3R2 encodes a ubiquitous regulatory subunit (p85β) of PI3K, an enzyme that generates 3-polyphosphoinositides at the plasma membrane. PI3K activation triggers cell survival and migration. We found that p85β expression is elevated in breast and colon carcinomas and that its increased expression correlates with PI3K pathway activation and tumor progression. p85β expression induced moderate PIP(3) generation at the cell membrane and enhanced cell invasion. In accordance, genetic alteration of pik3r2 expression levels modulated tumor progression in vivo. Increased p85β expression thus represents a cellular strategy in cancer progression.
"PLD2 plays a key role in cell membrane lipid reorganization and as a key cell signaling protein in leukocyte chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Adding to the large role for a lipase in cellular functions, recently, our lab has identified a PLD2-Rac2 binding through two CRIB domains in PLD2 and has defined PLD2 as having a new function, that of a GEF for Rac2. PLD2 joins other major GEFs, such as P-Rex1 and Vav, which operate mainly in leukocytes. We explain the biochemical and cellular implications of a lipase-GEF duality. Under normal conditions, GEFs are not constitutively active; instead, their activation is highly regulated. Activation of PLD2 leads to its localization at the plasma membrane, where it can access its substrate GTPases. We propose that PLD2 can act as a ""scaffold"" protein to increase efficiency of signaling and compartmentalization at a phagocytic cup or the leading edge of a leukocyte lamellipodium. This new concept will help our understanding of leukocyte crucial functions, such as cell migration and adhesion, and how their deregulation impacts chronic inflammation."
CLC proteins underlie muscle, kidney, bone, and other organ system function by catalyzing the transport of Cl(-) ions across cell and organellar membranes. Some CLC proteins are ion channels while others are pumps that exchange Cl(-) for H(+). The pathway through which Cl(-) ions cross the membrane has been characterized, but the transport of H(+) and the principle by which their movement is coupled to Cl(-) movement is not well understood. Here we show that H(+) transport depends not only on the presence of a specific glutamate residue but also the presence of Cl(-) ions. H(+) transport, however, can be isolated and analyzed in the absence of Cl(-) by mutating the glutamate to alanine and adding carboxylate-containing molecules to solution, consistent with the notion that H(+) transfer is mediated through the entry of a carboxylate group into the anion pathway. Cl(-) ions and carboxylate interact with each other strongly. These data support a mechanism in which the glutamate carboxylate functions as a surrogate Cl(-) ion, but it can accept a H(+) and transfer it between the external solution and the central Cl(-) binding site, coupled to the movement of 2 Cl(-) ions.
ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and ARBs (angiotensin II receptor blockers) are already widely used for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease and their potential role in other disease states has become increasingly recognized. COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is characterized by pathological inflammatory processes involving the lung parenchyma, airways and vascular bed. The aim of the present review is to outline the role of the RAS (renin-angiotensin system) in the pathogenesis of COPD, including reference to results from fibrotic lung conditions and pulmonary hypertension. The review will, in particular, address the emerging evidence that ACE inhibition could have a beneficial effect on skeletal muscle function and cardiovascular co-morbidity in COPD patients. The evidence to support the effect of RAS blockade as a novel therapeutic approach in COPD will be discussed.
ABO blood type O and highly sensitised patients have the smallest chance to receive kidney transplantation. Do alternative donation programs increase this chance? In the period studied: 2323 patients were enlisted on the Rotterdam waiting list for a renal transplantation: 435 patients still waiting (WL), 464 delisted without transplantation (DWT). 1424 received deceased donor (DD, 535) or living donor (LD, 889, including 204 alternative) transplantation. Alternative LD programs in our centre are: paired kidney-exchange, altruistic with domino-paired donation and ABO-incompatible donation (ABOi). Compared to populations not transplanted, blood type O recipients are significantly underrepresented in DD and all LD transplantation populations, except the ABOi program. Highly sensitised patients are overrepresented in DD, but underrepresented in all LD transplantation populations. The high transplantation rate of highly sensitised patients was the result of Eurotransplant Acceptable mismatch program (AM). The LD ABOi and DD AM programs are the only alternative donation programs favourable for patients with low chances. While the contribution of direct LD transplantations will increase in time, the relative success rate of low-chance patients will decrease. Beside increasing LD ABOi transplantation, a new DD allocation model favouring both highly immunised and blood type O patients is essential.
ABCG2 is an efflux transporter commonly found to overexpress in multidrug resistant (MDR) cancer cells. It is also believed to be a survival factor for cancer stem cells to drive tumor growth. Tumor microenvironment represents an attractive new drug target because it allows complex interaction between a tumor and its surrounding normal cells, molecules, and blood vessels, which all participate in tumor progression. Hypoxia, glucose deprivation and acidosis are the hallmarks of tumor microenvironment. This study investigated the upregulation of ABCG2 by these adverse growth conditions within the tumor microenvironment. Reporter gene assay revealed that a region within the ABCG2 promoter close to the reported HIF-1α response element is responsible for ABCG2 upregulation. Increased ABCG2 efflux activity was observed under the same conditions, subsequently leading to reduced response to ABCG2 substrate anticancer drug. Importantly, glucose deprivation and hypoxia were also found to enhance the resistance level of ABCG2-overexpressing resistant cells with pre-existing genetic and epigenetic MDR mechanisms. Hypoxia was further demonstrated to cause a more malignant anchorage-independent growth phenotype in the resistant cells, which can be abolished by knocking down ABCG2. A better understanding of ABCG2 regulation by the tumor microenvironment may help design novel strategies to improve treatment outcome.
CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 require cytochrome b5 (b5) and NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR) for optimum metabolism, but little is known about the specific requirements for b5 and CPR to produce optimal activities for these enzymes. The metabolism of testosterone (TT) by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 was analyzed by various combinations of b5 and CPR using a fixed amount of recombinant P450 which had been purified from an Escherichia coli expression system. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 required 4- and 8-fold more of CPR than of the P450s, respectively, for optimal activity. The requirement of b5 for optimal activity showed the same pattern for both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, exhibiting a gradual stimulation of the activity reaching a maximum at 16 fold more b5 than P450. Although CYP3A4 exhibited higher activities than CYP3A5 in all combinations, both enzymes exhibited the same dependency profile for b5 and CPR. Therefore, the stronger activity of CYP3A4 compared to CYP3A5 appears to be intrinsic to the CYP3A4 protein itself and not to different requirements for b5 and CPR. Since the relative amounts of b5 and CPR are important in the maintenance of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 activities, different levels of these proteins in vitro and in vivo may cause altered metabolism of their substrates or misinterpretation of enzyme properties.
CYP11B1 inhibition is a promising therapy for Cushing's syndrome. Starting from etomidate, references I and II, the title compounds were designed and synthesized. Cyclopropyl analogue 4 was identified as a CYP11B1 inhibitor more potent (IC(50) = 2.2 nM) than leads and more selective (SF = 11) than I and metyrapone. Since it also showed potent inhibition of rat CYP11B1 and good selectivity over human CYP17 and CYP19, it is a promising candidate for further development.
CYP2C19 is a polymorphic enzyme involved in the metabolism of clinically important drugs. Genotype-phenotype association studies of CYP2C19 have reported wide ranges in the metabolic ratios of its substrates. These discrepancies could be attributed to the variations in the promoter region and this aspect has been reported recently. The observations in the recent reports on the influence of promoter region variants on the metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates might also have been influenced by the copy number variations of CYP2C19. In this paper, we describe copy number variations of CYP2C19 using real-time polymerase chain reaction by comparative Ct method. No copy number variations were observed in the south Indian population indicating the observed discrepancies in genotype-phenotype association studies might be due to the regulatory region polymorphisms as reported earlier.
ABCB6 is a member of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette family of transporter proteins that is increasingly recognized as a relevant physiological and therapeutic target. Evaluation of modulators of ABCB6 activity would pave the way toward a more complete understanding of the significance of this transport process in tumor cell growth, proliferation and therapy-related drug resistance. In addition, this effort would improve our understanding of the function of ABCB6 in normal physiology with respect to heme biosynthesis, and cellular adaptation to metabolic demand and stress responses. To search for modulators of ABCB6, we developed a novel cell-based approach that, in combination with flow cytometric high-throughput screening (HTS), can be used to identify functional modulators of ABCB6. Accumulation of protoporphyrin, a fluorescent molecule, in wild-type ABCB6 expressing K562 cells, forms the basis of the HTS assay. Screening the Prestwick Chemical Library employing the HTS assay identified four compounds, benzethonium chloride, verteporfin, tomatine hydrochloride and piperlongumine, that reduced ABCB6 mediated cellular porphyrin levels. Validation of the identified compounds employing the hemin-agarose affinity chromatography and mitochondrial transport assays demonstrated that three out of the four compounds were capable of inhibiting ABCB6 mediated hemin transport into isolated mitochondria. However, only verteporfin and tomatine hydrochloride inhibited ABCB6's ability to compete with hemin as an ABCB6 substrate. This assay is therefore sensitive, robust, and suitable for automation in a high-throughput environment as demonstrated by our identification of selective functional modulators of ABCB6. Application of this assay to other libraries of synthetic compounds and natural products is expected to identify novel modulators of ABCB6 activity.
PIK3CA is an oncogene component of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway and is associated with cell proliferation and carcinogenesis in a variety of human cancers. PIK3CA mutation is correlated with the aggressiveness of many epithelial cancers. And so PIK3CA is considered as a major oncogene in many human epithelial malignancies. However, its role in tongue carcinoma is unknown. We used lentiviral-mediated interfering short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knock down PIK3CA expression in tongue carcinoma Tca8113 cells, and then we tested the cell proliferation by MTT assay and cell invasiveness by cell invasion assay. To examine whether PIK3CA is involved in the response of Tca8113 cells to an anticancer drug, cisplatin, we further performed cell death analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We found that knocking down PIK3CA led to slower cell growth and lessened cell invasiveness. In addition, PIK3CA downregulation increased Tca8113 cell death after cisplatin treatment, suggesting that PIK3CA downregulation might be helpful to increase the effects of some anticancer drugs. Moreover, in a mouse model of established large sized OSCC, we showed that suppression of PIK3CA markedly diminished tumorigenicity in vivo. To understand its molecular mechanism of action, we measured expression of phospho-PTEN (Ser380) and phospho-AKT (Ser473) by Western blot and found that suppression of PIK3CA inhibited OSCC growth through downregulation of p-PTEN and p-AKT. Our study highlights critical roles for PIK3CA in the tongue cancer, and suggests that PIK3CA gene might be considered as a therapeutic target for clinical tongue cancer.
CD36 has been linked to the etiology of insulin resistance and inflammation. We explored its function in regulating adipose tissue lipolysis, which influences fat accumulation by liver and muscle and overall metabolism. Knockdown of CD36 in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes decreased lipolysis in response to 10 μM of the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (by 42%), 10 μM of the adenyl cyclase activator forskolin (by 32%), and 500 μM of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (by 33%). All three treatments in the knockdown adipocytes were associated with significant decreases of cAMP levels and of the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin phosphorylation. An important role for PDE was supported by the lack of inhibition of the lipolysis induced by the poorly hydrolyzable dibutyryl cAMP analog. An additional contributory mechanism was diminished activation of the Src-ERK1/2 pathway. Regulation of lipolysis and lipolytic signaling by CD36 was reproduced with adipose tissue from CD36(-/-) mice. The importance of surface CD36 in this regulation was suggested by the finding that the plasma membrane-impermeable CD36 inhibitor sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (20 μM) decreased lipolysis. Interestingly, isoproterenol induced CD36 internalization, and this process was blocked by HSL inhibition, suggesting feedback regulation of adipocyte lipolysis via CD36 trafficking.
CYP2E1 promoter polymorphisms can lead to significant interindividual differences in expression of CYP2E1. Using a database of CYP2E1 gene polymorphisms established in 2010, our study aimed to functionally characterize the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the promoter region and corresponding haplotypes in the Chinese Han population. Six novel SNPs and seven haplotypes with a frequency equal to or greater than 0.01 were constructed on a luciferase reporter system on the basis of site-directed mutagenesis. Dual luciferase reporter systems were used to analyze regulatory activity. The constructs including single novel SNP mutations exhibited insignificant change in luciferase activity, whereas, the activity produced by Haplo1(GTTGCTATAT), Haplo2 (CTTGCTATAT) and Haplo7 (GAGCTCACAT), containing a -333T>A polymorphism was significantly greater than for the wild type in Hep G2 cells (p<0.05), being 1.5-, 2.0- and 1.4- times greater respectively. These findings suggest the possibility of significant clinical prediction of adverse drug reaction and the facilitation of personalized medicine.
ABO compatibility has been believed to be necessary in kidney transplantation (Ktx) to prevent acute antibody-mediated rejection. However, developments in immunosuppression and immunoadsorption techniques have overcome acute antibody-mediated rejection caused by ABO incompatibility. Herein, we have presented the first ABO-incompatible Ktx cases in Turkey. All recipients did not have an ABO-compatible donor but presented significant dialysis inadequacy due to vascular access problems.
PFKFB3 is a target gene of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and encodes for inducible 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (iPFK2). As a key regulatory enzyme that stimulates glycolysis, PFKFB3/iPFK2 links adipocyte metabolic and inflammatory responses. Additionally, PFKFB3/iPFK2 is involved in the effect of active PPARγ on suppressing overnutrition-induced adipose tissue inflammatory response, which accounts for the insulin-sensitizing and antidiabetic effects of PPARγ activation. Using PFKFB3/iPFK2-disrupted mice, the present study investigated the role of PFKFB3/iPFK2 in regulating overnutrition-associated intestine inflammatory response and in mediating the effects of PPARγ activation. In wild-type mice, intestine PFKFB3/iPFK2 was increased in response to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding compared with that in mice fed a low-fat diet. However, intestine PFKFB3/iPFK2 was decreased in PFKFB3/iPFK2-disrupted mice and did not respond to HFD feeding. Furthermore, on an HFD, PFKFB3/iPFK2-disrupted mice displayed a significant increase in major intestine proinflammatory indicators such as toll-like receptor 4 expression, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 and nuclear factor kappa B phosphorylation, and proinflammatory cytokine expression compared with wild-type littermates. Upon treatment with rosiglitazone, an agonist of PPARγ, intestine proinflammatory indicators were markedly decreased in wild-type mice, but to a much lesser degree in PFKFB3/iPFK2-disrupted mice. Overall, the status of HFD-induced intestine inflammatory response in all treated mice correlated inversely with systemic insulin sensitivity, indicated by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance data. Together, these results suggest that PFKFB3/iPFK2 is critically involved in the effect of PPARγ activation on suppressing diet-induced intestine inflammatory response.
NQO1 is an emerging and promising therapeutic target in cancer therapy. This study was to determine whether the anti-tumor effect of tanshinone IIA (TSA) is NQO1 dependent and to elucidate the underlying apoptotic cell death pathways. NQO1(+) A549 cells and isogenically matched NQO1 transfected and negative H596 cells were used to test the properties and mechanisms of TSA induced cell death. The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy and the tissue distribution properties of TSA were tested in tumor xenografted nude mice. We observed that TSA induced an excessive generation of ROS, DNA damage, and dramatic apoptotic cell death in NQO1(+) A549 cells and H596-NQO1 cells, but not in NQO1(-) H596 cells. Inhibition or silence of NQO1 as well as the antioxidant NAC markedly reversed TSA induced apoptotic effects. TSA treatment significantly retarded the tumor growth of A549 tumor xenografts, which was significantly antagonized by dicoumarol co-treatment in spite of the increased and prolonged TSA accumulations in tumor tissues. TSA activated a ROS triggered, p53 independent and caspase dependent mitochondria apoptotic cell death pathway that is characterized with increased ratio of Bax to Bcl-xl, mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, cytochrome c release, and subsequent caspase activation and PARP-1 cleavage. The results of these findings suggest that TSA is a highly specific NQO1 target agent and is promising in developing as an effective drug in the therapy of NQO1 positive NSCLC.
ABCG2 is a plasma membrane multidrug transporter with an established role in the cancer drug-resistance phenotype. This protein is expressed in a variety of tissues, including several types of stem cell. Although ABCG2 is not essential for life, knock-out mice were found to be hypersensitive to xenobiotics and had reduced levels of the side population of hematopoietic stem cells. Previously we have shown that ABCG2 is present in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines, with a heterogeneous expression pattern. In this study we examined this heterogeneity, and investigated whether it is related to stress responses in hESCs. We did not find any difference between expression of pluripotency markers in ABCG2-positive and negative hESCs; however, ABCG2-expressing cells had a higher growth rate after cell separation. We found that some harmful conditions (physical stress, drugs, and UV light exposure) are tolerated much better in the presence of ABCG2 protein. This property can be explained by the transporter function which eliminates potential toxic metabolites accumulated during stress conditions. In contrast, mild oxidative stress in hESCs caused rapid internalization of ABCG2, indicating that some environmental factors may induce removal of this transporter from the plasma membrane. On the basis of these results we suggest that a dynamic balance of ABCG2 expression at the population level has the advantage of enabling prompt response to changes in the cellular environment. Such actively maintained heterogeneity might be of evolutionary benefit in protecting special cell types, including pluripotent stem cells.
GAPDH plays a major enzymatic role in the intermediary metabolism of human tissues. In fact, the cells of all organisms require the catalytic capability of GAPDH in order to maintain adequate glycolytic flux. Even the primitive archaea rely on GAPDH in a pivotal step in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, which is a series of reactions that resembles glycolysis. GAPDH catalyzes the sixth reaction of glycolysis in eukaryotic cells and represents a regulatory hurdle in anaerobic glycolysis. The triose substrate of GAPDH is actually a product of several important metabolic pathways: stage one of glycolysis, fructose catabolism, pentose phosphate pathway and glycerol metabolism. The GAPDH reaction is reversible, hence, necessary for hepatic gluconeogenesis. The chapter discusses GAPDH as being a metabolic 'switching station', diverting carbon flow appropriately. There is discussion regarding the experimental analysis of GAPDH's enzymatic function, particularly in the use of inhibitors. The GAPDH gene is portrayed in the context of the enzyme's role in metabolism. The observed intolerance to genetic mutation suggests that the genetic changes (i.e. those seen across species) may provide a treasure of information regarding the limits of genetic variability that can be tolerated and still allow for the protein to conduct essential glycolytic - as well as non-glycolytic - functions.
GAPDH interacts with a plethora of diverse cellular proteins. The network of interacting partners, or interactome, is presented for GAPDH with the interacting molecules grouped into specific functional and structural categories. By organizing the binding partners in this way, certain common structural features are beginning to surface, such as acidic dipeptide sequences that are found in several of these binding proteins. Additionally, the consensus sequences for target polynucleotides are being brought to light. The categories, which are presented according to function, offer an opportunity for research into the corresponding structural correlates to these interactions. Recent discoveries of interacting proteins have revealed novel relationships that are generating emerging mechanisms. Proteins that are associated with age-related neurodegenerative diseases appear to be particularly prone to binding GAPDH, suggesting that GAPDH may be playing a role in these diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases that are discussed are the conformational diseases of aging, suggesting that GAPDH may be a global sensor for cellular conformational stress. In addition to GAPDH's oxidoreductase activity, several other enzymatic functions have been discovered, including peroxidase, nitrosylase, mono-ADP-ribosylase and kinase activities.
PDE8B is a cAMP-specific isoform of the broader class of phosphodiesterases (PDEs). As no selective PDE8B inhibitors had been reported, a high throughput screen was run with the goal of identifying selective tools for exploring the potential therapeutic utility of PDE8B inhibition. Of the numerous hits, one was particularly attractive since it was amenable to rapid deconstruction leading to inhibitors with very high ligand efficiency (LE) and lipophilic ligand efficiency (LLE). These triazolopyrimidines were optimized for potency, selectivity and ADME properties ultimately leading to compound 42. This compound was highly potent and selective with good bioavailability and advanced into pre-clinical development.
"ABO blood groups antigens have biological and clinical significance. The ABO blood groups antigens has been associated with many diseases, though the explanation between ABO blood groups and disease is still unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the presence of a possible association between benign tumors of the utesus with blood ABO, RhD, Kell and MN groups in women in reproductive periods. In diseased population (60 subject) was investigated for Erythrocyte phenotypic groups antigens. Immunoserological methods have been used to identify the antigens. The obtained results were statistically processed. High frequencies of A (43,3±3,2%), D(91,6±3,5%) and Kell (+) (26.66±5.7 %) antigens were found in diseased of benign tumors of uterus comparison with donor. The researches shows, that is increased risk of disease development in carriers of these phenotypes. In summary, according our research we've thought, that blood groups may be a marker for bening tomors of the uterus. Based on these data, these could be used as prognostic factor for bening tomors of the uterus. The study of Erythrocyte group antigens in diseased we may to identify ""high risk"" individuals, that help to find ways, which help to control of disease."
CYP27B1 is a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 that catalyses the hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 at the C1α-position to give the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. We successfully expressed human CYP27B1 in Escherichia coli and partially purified this labile enzyme and carried out a detailed characterization of its kinetic properties in a reconstituted membrane environment. The phospholipid concentration did not affect the enzyme activity in the vesicle-reconstituted system, although it was influenced by the phospholipid composition, with the addition of cardiolipin lowering the K(m)  for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. These data are consistent with the enzyme accessing substrate from the hydrophobic domain of the vesicle membrane. Cardiolipin also caused the appearance of inhibition of activity at high substrate concentrations. This substrate inhibition fitted a model for one catalytic and two inhibitory sites on the enzyme for the binding of substrate. The K(m)  for human adrenodoxin was observed to decrease with decreasing substrate concentration, with the catalytic efficiency (k(cat) /K(m) ) being largely independent of adrenodoxin concentration. Human CYP27B1 was also active on 25-hydroxyvitamin D(2)  and on intermediates of the CYP24A1-mediated inactivation pathway, 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 24-oxo-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 24-oxo-23,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, with all these substrates showing comparable k(cat)  values of 50-71 min(-1) , similar to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. The latter two substrates gave higher K(m)  values than that for 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3. The present study shows that human CYP27B1 can be partially purified in an active form with the enzyme displaying high activity towards a range of substrates in a phospholipid vesicle-reconstituted system that mimics the inner-mitochondrial membrane.
CAT ON A HOT TIN SUPPORT: Coaxial Pt/TiN nanotube arrays are used to achieve a superior electrocatalytic activity of platinum towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Compared to a commercial Pt/C catalyst, the Pt/TiN NTA materials delivers a higher mass activity and specific activity for the ORR. Hence, these materials are useful as cathodes for hybrid electrolyte Li-air batteries, as demonstrated.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is a tumor suppressor and has been suggested recently to be involved in the regulation of cardiovascular diseases. The molecular mechanisms of this regulation are however poorly understood. This study shows that down regulation of PTEN expression and activity by angiotensin II (Ang II) increased proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The presence of Ang II induced rapid PTEN phosphorylation and oxidation in accordance with increased AKT and FAK phosphorylation. The Ang II-mediated VSMC proliferation and migration was inhibited when cellular PTEN expression was increased by AT1 inhibitor losartan, PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone, NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082. Over expression of PTEN in VSMCs by adenovirus transduction also resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and migration in response to Ang II. These results suggest that PTEN down-regulation is involved in proliferation and migration of VSMCs induced by Ang II. This provides insight into the molecular regulation of PTEN in vascular smooth muscle cells and suggests that targeting the action of PTEN may represent an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
COMT (Catechol-O methyltransferase) gene is one of the key players in synaptic plasticity and in learning and memory mechanisms. A single nucleotide polymorphism (rs4680; G to A) in the COMT coding region causes Val158Met aminoacid substitution in the corresponding protein, with Val allele exhibiting a 3- to 4-fold increase in enzyme activity compared to Met. With the purpose of examining the influence of COMT as a genetic risk factor for cognitive impairment, we analyzed a sample of 248 healthy subjects, 276 patients affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 70 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the latter condition possibly representing a prodrome for dementia. All subjects were analyzed for COMT rs4680 polymorphism and APOE genotype. Our study strengthens data showing that APOE ε4 allele is an independent risk factor for AD and also a risk factor for MCI. Neither COMT alleles nor genotypes proved to be independently associated with the risk of AD or MCI in our sample. However, we found an association between COMT GG genotype (Val/Val) and APOE ε4 carrier status and the risk of AD and MCI. In particular, when GG genotype is included into the multinomial analysis, the risk of AD and MCI due to APOE ε4 allele is increased of about 2-3 fold; moreover, the risk conferred by the combination of G and ε4 alleles is more pronounced in male patients. To our knowledge, this synergistic effect is here shown for the first time on a population sample representative of Caucasian patients.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) and MAST2 (microtubule-associated serine and threonine kinase 2) interact with each other through the PDZ domain of MAST2 (MAST2-PDZ) and the carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) PDZ domain-binding site (PDZ-BS) of PTEN. These two proteins function as negative regulators of cell survival pathways, and silencing of either one promotes neuronal survival. In human neuroblastoma cells infected with rabies virus (RABV), the C-terminal PDZ domain of the viral glycoprotein (G protein) can target MAST2-PDZ, and RABV infection triggers neuronal survival in a PDZ-BS-dependent fashion. These findings suggest that the PTEN-MAST2 complex inhibits neuronal survival and that viral G protein disrupts this complex through competition with PTEN for binding to MAST2-PDZ. We showed that the C-terminal sequences of PTEN and the viral G protein bound to MAST2-PDZ with similar affinities. Nuclear magnetic resonance structures of these complexes exhibited similar large interaction surfaces, providing a structural basis for their binding specificities. Additionally, the viral G protein promoted the nuclear exclusion of PTEN in infected neuroblastoma cells in a PDZ-BS-dependent manner without altering total PTEN abundance. These findings suggest that formation of the PTEN-MAST2 complex is specifically affected by the viral G protein and emphasize how disruption of a critical protein-protein interaction regulates intracellular PTEN trafficking. In turn, the data show how the viral protein might be used to decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms and to clarify how the subcellular localization of PTEN regulates neuronal survival.
IDH1 mutations are frequent genetic alterations in low-grade diffuse gliomas and secondary glioblastoma (GBM). To validate mutation frequency, IDH1 gene at codon 132 was sequenced in 74 diffusely infiltrating astrocytomas: diffuse astrocytoma (DA; World Health Organization [WHO] grade II), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA; WHO grade III), and GBM (WHO grade IV). All cases were immunostained with IDH1-R132H monoclonal antibody. Mutational status was correlated with mutant protein expression, patient age, duration of symptoms, and prognosis of patients with GBM. We detected 31 (41.9%) heterozygous IDH1 mutations resulting in arginine-to-histidine substitution (R132H;CGT-CAT). All 12 DAs (100%), 13 of 14 AAs (92.9%), and 6 of 48 GBMs (12.5%) (5/6 [83.3%] secondary, and 1/42 [2.4%] primary) harbored IDH1 mutations. The correlation between mutational status and protein expression was significant (P < . 001). IDH1 mutation status, though not associated with prognosis of patients with GBM, showed significant association with younger age and longer duration of symptoms in the whole cohort (P < .001). Our study validates IDH1 mutant protein expression across various grades of astrocytoma, and demonstrates a high incidence of IDH1 mutations in DA, AA, and secondary GBM.
OAT self-managament, based on autonomous analysis practice using portable systems and dose auto adjustment guided by algorithms, has shown to have superiority over all other management systems, including anticoagulation centralized units. This system has successfully reduced thromboembolic events, major bleeding and, more importantly, mortality from any cause. The patient education for self-management is probably the essential key to the success of this model. Proper patient selection and relevant training ensure the effectiveness and reliability of self- management.
"CP 47,497, a potent cannabinoid receptor type 1 agonist, is the main active ingredient in the herbal mixture ""Spice"" sold in European countries. The illegal use of ""Spice"" for its psychoactive effects has become a social issue. In this study, the in vitro metabolism of CP 47,497 was investigated in human liver microsomes to characterize the metabolic fate of CP 47,497. CP 47,497 was incubated with human liver microsomes, and the reaction mixture was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A total of eight metabolites were detected in human liver microsomes and structurally characterized based on mass spectral data. The main metabolic pathways involved hydroxylations or oxygenations. The identified metabolites were mono-oxygenated metabolites (M1 and M4), mono-hydroxylated metabolites (M3, M5, M6, M7, and M8), and a di-oxygenated metabolite (M2). The detection of these metabolites could confirm the presence of CP 47,497 in biological samples; therefore, collectively, they would be excellent indicators of ""Spice"" drug abuse."
ACE type 2 (ACE2) functions as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system by cleaving angiotensin II (AII) into angiotensin 1-7 (A1-7). This study assessed the role of endogenous ACE2 in maintaining insulin sensitivity. Twelve-week-old male ACE2 knockout (ACE2KO) mice had normal insulin sensitivities when fed a standard diet. AII infusion or a high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity more severely in ACE2KO mice than in their wild-type (WT) littermates. The strain difference in glucose tolerance was not eliminated by an AII receptor type 1 (AT1) blocker but was eradicated by A1-7 or an AT1 blocker combined with the A1-7 inhibitor (A779). The expression of GLUT4 and a transcriptional factor, myocyte enhancer factor (MEF) 2A, was dramatically reduced in the skeletal muscles of the standard diet-fed ACE2KO mice. The expression of GLUT4 and MEF2A was increased by A1-7 in ACE2KO mice and decreased by A779 in WT mice. A1-7 enhanced upregulation of MEF2A and GLUT4 during differentiation of myoblast cells. In conclusion, ACE2 protects against high-calorie diet-induced insulin resistance in mice. This mechanism may involve the transcriptional regulation of GLUT4 via an A1-7-dependent pathway.
CYP2B6 variation predicts pharmacokinetic characteristics of its substrates. Consideration for underlying genetic structure is critical to protect against spurious associations with the highly polymorphic CYP2B6 gene.
UCP1 catalyzes proton leak across the mitochondrial inner membrane to disengage substrate oxidation from ATP production. It is well established that UCP1 is activated by fatty acids and inhibited by purine nucleotides, but precisely how this regulation occurs remains unsettled. Although fatty acids can competitively overcome nucleotide inhibition in functional assays, fatty acids have little effect on purine nucleotide binding. Here, we present the first demonstration that fatty acids induce a conformational change in UCP1. Palmitate dramatically changed the binding kinetics of 2'/3'-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-GDP, a fluorescently labeled nucleotide analog, for UCP1. Furthermore, palmitate accelerated the rate of enzymatic proteolysis of UCP1. The altered kinetics of both processes indicate that fatty acids change the conformation of UCP1, reconciling the apparent discrepancy between existing functional and ligand binding data. Our results provide a framework for how fatty acids and nucleotides compete to regulate the activity of UCP1.
LPL (lipoprotein lipase) is a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of triglycerides. Previous studies have shown that microRNA (miR)-467b regulates hepatic LPL expression and plays a role in the progression of steatosis or abnormal lipid retention in obese mice. Macrophage-derived LPL has been shown to promote atherosclerosis. However, if miR-476b influences macrophage LPL expression and the subsequent effects are unknown. Here, we utilized oxLDL-treatment RAW 264.7 macrophages that were transfected with miR-467b mimics or inhibitors to investigate the potential roles of macrophage miR-476b. We found that miR-467b significantly decreased lipid accumulation and IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and MCP-1 secretions. Furthermore, our studies suggested an additional explanation for the regulatory mechanism of miR-467b on its functional target, LPL in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Thus, our findings indicate that miR-467b may regulate lipid accumulation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in oxLDL-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages by targeting the LPL gene.
DOT1L is the human protein methyltransferase responsible for catalyzing the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 79 (H3K79). The ectopic activity of DOT1L, associated with the chromosomal translocation that is a universal hallmark of MLL-rearranged leukemia, is a required driver of leukemogenesis in this malignancy. Here, we present studies on the structure-activity relationship of aminonucleoside-based DOT1L inhibitors. Within this series, we find that improvements in target enzyme affinity and selectivity are driven entirely by diminution of the dissociation rate constant for the enzyme-inhibitor complex, leading to long residence times for the binary complex. The biochemical K(i)  and residence times measured for these inhibitors correlate well with their effects on intracellular H3K79 methylation and MLL-rearranged leukemic cell killing. Crystallographic studies reveal a conformational adaptation mechanism associated with high-affinity inhibitor binding and prolonged residence time; these studies also suggest that conformational adaptation likewise plays a critical role in natural ligand interactions with the enzyme, hence, facilitating enzyme turnover. These results provide critical insights into the role of conformational adaptation in the enzymatic mechanism of catalysis and in pharmacologic intervention for DOT1L and other members of this enzyme class.
UGT1A9 contributes to the glucuronidation of numerous drugs and xenobiotics. There is evidence to suggest that the Met33Thr substitution, as occurs in the polymorphic variant UGT1A9*3, variably affects xenobiotic glucuronidation. The equivalent position in UGT1A4 is also known to influence enzyme activity, whilst an N-terminal domain histidine (His37 in UGT1A9) is believed to function as the catalytic base in most UGT enzymes. To elucidate the roles of key amino acids and characterise structure-function relationships, we determined the effects of amino acid substitutions at positions 33 and 37 of UGT1A9 on the kinetics of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), mycophenolic acid (MPA), propofol (PRO), sulfinpyrazone (SFZ), frusemide (FSM), (S)-naproxen (NAP) and retigabine (RTB) glucuronidation, compounds that undergo glucuronidation at either a phenolic (4-MU, MPA, PRO), carboxylate (FSM, NAP), acidic carbon (SFZ) or amine (RTB) function. Substitution of Met33 with Val, Ile, Thr, and Gln, as occur in UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4 and UGT1A6 respectively, variably affected kinetics and catalytic efficiency. Whilst K(m) values were generally higher and V(max) and CL(int) values were generally lower than for wild-type UGT1A9 with most substrate-mutant pairs, the pattern and the magnitude of the changes in each parameter differed substantially. Moreover, exceptions occurred; CL(int) values for MPA and FSM glucuronidation by the position-33 mutants were the same as or higher than that of UGT1A9. Mutation of His37 abolished activity towards all substrates, except RTB N-glucuronidation. The data confirm the importance of single amino acids for UGT enzyme activity and substrate selectivity, and support a pivotal role for residue-33 in facilitating substrate binding to UGT1A9.
MTHFR C677T polymorphism (rs1801133) was associated with numerous psychiatric conditions but no prior study investigated whether it predisposes to completed suicide. We typed rs1801133 in 692 suicide victims and 3257 controls representative of a Polish adult population (the WOBASZ cohort). Although we had a power of 0.8 to detect (at alpha 0.05) an allelic OR=1.19, we did not find significant difference among suicides vs. controls in the prevalence of the MTHFR 677T allele (OR=1.02, p=0.759) or the TT genotype (OR=1.01, p=0.926). Since among controls we found an association between TT and depression defined by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, OR=1.61, p=0.049) we also compared suicides with controls without signs of depression (BDI ≤ 11) but found no association (OR=1.0, p=0.976). Analyses within suicides showed trends (not significant after Bonferroni correction) for correlations between the dose of the T allele and age at death among males and blood ethanol concentration among females, who committed suicide under the influence of alcohol. We conclude that MTHFR C677T polymorphism is not a risk factor for completed suicide. The sex-specific trends for correlations between rs1801133 and age at death, and blood ethanol concentration should be studied further.
CBS (cystathionine β-synthase) is a multidomain tetrameric enzyme essential in the regulation of homocysteine metabolism, whose activity is enhanced by the allosteric regulator SAM (S-adenosylmethionine). Missense mutations in CBS are the major cause of inherited HCU (homocystinuria). In the present study we apply a novel approach based on a combination of calorimetric methods, functional assays and kinetic modelling to provide structural and energetic insight into the effects of SAM on the stability and activity of WT (wild-type) CBS and seven HCU-causing mutants. We found two sets of SAM-binding sites in the C-terminal regulatory domain with different structural and energetic features: a high affinity set of two sites, probably involved in kinetic stabilization of the regulatory domain, and a low affinity set of four sites, which are involved in the enzyme activation. We show that the regulatory domain displays a low kinetic stability in WT CBS, which is further decreased in many HCU-causing mutants. We propose that the SAM-induced stabilization may play a key role in modulating steady-state levels of WT and mutant CBS in vivo. Our strategy may be valuable for understanding ligand effects on proteins with a complex architecture and their role in human genetic diseases and for the development of novel pharmacological strategies.
CD36 is a multifunctional molecule engaged in the removal of oxidised LDL from plasma. It is unclear whether mutation of the CD36 gene protects against, or increases, the risk of hypercholesterolaemia, atherosclerosis and its complications.
AQP7 is a glycerol channel in adipose tissue with a suggested role in controlling the accumulation of triglycerides and secondly development of obesity and type-2 diabetes. In the present study, we aimed to test the hypotheses that (1) AQP7 is localized to the capillaries within human adipose tissue, (2) genetic predisposition to type-2 diabetes is associated with a low expression of AQP7 in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and (3) physical training increases AQP7 expression in SAT. The cellular localization of AQP7 in adipose tissue was investigated by immunohistochemistry. The relative expression of AQP7 protein in abdominal SAT was analysed before and after ending a 10-week exercise training programme in first-degree relatives to type-2 diabetic patients and control individuals. Non-obese first-degree relatives to type-2 diabetic patients (n = 20) and control (n = 11) men and women participated in this study. By this, we find that AQP7 is localized to the capillary endothelial cells within adipose tissue. We were unable to evidence a link between a low AQP7 abundance in SAT and genetic predisposition type-2 diabetes. Instead we demonstrate that physical training influences the expression of AQP7 in SAT in a gender-specific manner. Thus, women responds by increasing the abundance of AQP7 by 2.2-fold (p = 0.03) whereas in men a reduced expression is observed (p = 0.00009), resulting in a more than twofold higher abundance of AQP7 in women as compared with men. In conclusion, the adipose tissue glycerol channel, AQP7, is regulated in response to physical training in a gender-dependent manner in SAT.
G6PD is an X-linked gene enzyme that protects erythrocytes from hemolysis when they are exposed to antimalarial drugs because of the effects of the free radicals generated by these drugs. We investigated the effects of Fansidar ™ (Sulfatoxine/Pyrimethamine) and Coartem ™ (Artemether/Lumefantrine) on the hemolysis of malaria parasitized female erythrocytes. Twelve (12) malarious patients attending the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria, were used in this study. Ten (10) apparently healthy female students from the Medical School, University of Benin, acted as control. Low, normal (the recommended adult dose) and high doses of Fansidar ™ and Coartem ™ were used to determine the percentage hemolysis by checking the absorbance of the various samples. Data was analyzed by the Student's t-test and ANOVA with p<0.05 indicating the level of significance. At low doses of Fansidar ™ and Coartem ™, no hemolysis occurred, while at normal doses, Fansidar ™ showed no hemolysis but significant hemolysis (p<0.05) was observed in the Coartem ™ group. At high doses, both FansidarTM and CoartemTM caused significant (p<0.05) hemolysis. High doses of both drugs and normal dose of CoartemTM caused significant hemolysis. There was no hemolysis observed in the normal dose of FansidarTM and low doses for both drugs, similar to the trend reported for male subjects.
B4GALT1 gene encodes type II membrane-bound glycoprotein, named β-1, 4-galactosyltransferase 1 (β1, 4-Gal-T1), which can transfer galactose to acceptor sugars. B4GALT1 gene plays important roles in physiological process and disease development. In this study, we investigate the possible role and mechanism of B4GALT1 gene in multidrug resistance of human leukemia cell line. Significantly, higher expression of B4GALT1 was observed in adriamycin-resistant (ADR) K562 cell line (K562/ADR) than that in K562 cell line by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The activity of β1, 4-Gal-T1 enzyme, and Galβ-1,4GlcNAc structures on cell membrane glycoproteins was found at higher levels in K562/ADR cells than those in K562 cells. Further analysis of the B4GALT1 deregulation after using RNA interference approach showed that the silencing of B4GALT1 in K562/ADR cells resulted in increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs both in vitro and in vivo. The activity of the hedgehog signaling pathway affected the chemosensitivity of K562/ADR cells and was downregulated in K562/ADR cells with suppression of B4GALT1 gene. We hypothesize that B4GALT1 is responsible for the overcoming multidrug resistance in human leukemia therapy via regulating the activity of the hedgehog signaling pathway.
CYP1B1 has been implicated in primary congenital glaucoma with autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Mutations in CYP1B1 have also been reported in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) cases and suggested to act as a modifier of the disease along with Myocilin (MYOC). Earlier reports suggest that over-expression of myocilin leads to POAG pathogenesis. Taken together, we propose a functional interaction between CYP1B1 and myocilin where 17β estradiol acts as a mediator. Therefore, we hypothesize that 17β estradiol can induce MYOC expression through the putative estrogen responsive elements (EREs) located in its promoter and CYP1B1 could manipulate MYOC expression by metabolizing 17β estradiol to 4-hydroxy estradiol, thus preventing it from binding to MYOC promoter. Hence any mutation in CYP1B1 that reduces its 17β estradiol metabolizing activity might lead to MYOC upregulation, which in turn might play a role in glaucoma pathogenesis. It was observed that 17β estradiol is present in Human Trabecular Meshwork cells (HTM) and Retinal Pigment Epithelial cells (RPE) by immunoflouresence and ELISA. Also, the expression of enzymes related to estrogen biosynthesis pathway was observed in both cell lines by RT-PCR. Subsequent evaluation of the EREs in the MYOC promoter by luciferase assay, with dose and time dependent treatment of 17β estradiol, showed that the EREs are indeed active. This observation was further validated by direct binding of estrogen receptors (ER) on EREs in MYOC promoter and subsequent upregulation in MYOC level in HTM cells on 17β estradiol treatment. Interestingly, CYP1B1 mutants with less than 10% enzymatic activity were found to increase the level of endogenous myocilin in HTM cells. Thus the experimental observations are consistent with our proposed hypothesis that mutant CYP1B1, lacking the 17β estradiol metabolizing activity, can cause MYOC upregulation, which might have a potential implication in glaucoma pathogenesis.
GAMT deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of creatine biosynthesis resulting in severe neurological complications in untreated patients. Currently available treatment is only successful to stop disease progression, but is not sufficient to reverse neurological complications occurring prior to diagnosis. Normal neurodevelopmental outcome in a patient, treated in the newborn period, highlights the importance of early diagnosis.
CYP1B1 is a key P450 enzyme involved in the metabolism of exogenous and endogenous substrates and plays a key role in hormone-induced carcinogenesis. Risk factors for ovarian cancer are related to hormonal exposure and reproduction, and polymorphisms within genes involved in metabolism of oestrogen and certain xenobiotics may influence the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Current meta-analysis evaluated four CYP1B1 polymorphisms (Leu432Val, Arg48Gly, Ala119Ser and Asn453Ser) for their association with ovarian cancer risk. A search of the MEDLINE bibliographic database for the period up to April 2012 identified five relevant studies. With regards to Leu432Val polymorphism, all of the five studies were eligible (1199 cases and 2596 controls) for analysis, while for Arg48Gly (799 cases and 1169 controls), Ala119Ser (799 cases and 1172 controls) and Asn453Ser (361cases and 1577 controls) only two studies were eligible for analysis. Fixed-effect models were used to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and chi-square based Q-test was used to test for heterogeneity. The pooled OR (95% CI) for CYP1B1_Leu432Val polymorphism were 1.1 (0.84-1.31) for heterozygous subjects and 0.82 (0.57-1.17) for homozygous Val subjects. In a recessive model, homozygous carriers of Leu432Val showed a weak trend towards reduced risk as compared to 'wild type' and heterozygous carriers (OR 0.8, 95% CI; 0.66-0.99); however, this association was of limited significance. Regarding Arg48Gly, the pooled OR (95% CI) were 1.06 (0.89-1.27) for heterozygous and 0.98 (1.72-1.33) for homozygous Gly subjects. With respect to Ala119Ser and Asn453Ser, the pooled OR were 1.06 (0.87-1.29) and 1.24 (0.94-1.63) for heterozygous and 1.1 (0.8-1.52) and 1.09 (0.5-2.34) for homozygous respectively. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that CYP1B1 polymorphisms are not associated with ovarian cancer risk. Studies evaluating CYP1B1_Leu432Val polymorphism are required to further elucidate the risk of ovarian cancer with this polymorphism. Additionally, studies amongst Asian and African subjects are required to estimate race-specific effects.
CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are involved in both detoxification and metabolic activation of xenobiotics. Human CYP1A1 (hCYP1A1) and hCYP1A2 exist in a head-to-head orientation in chromosome 15 with the overlapping 5'-flanking region. We have recently reported that nuclear receptor constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), in addition to aryl hydrocarbon receptor, bidirectionally transactivates these genes through common motifs. In this study, we have investigated a role of liver X receptor α (LXRα), another liver-enriched nuclear receptor, in the expression hCYP1A1 and hCYP1A2. In reporter assays with dual-reporter constructs containing their promoter region between two different reporter genes, LXRα simultaneously transactivated hCYP1A1 and hCYP1A2 through two regions, independent of aryl hydrocarbon receptor. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, LXRα/retinoid X receptor α heterodimer bound to two ER8-type motifs found at around -520 and -460 of hCYP1A1. The former corresponds to the CAR-binding motif previously identified. Reporter assays using mutated constructs confirmed the critical roles of these motifs in the LXRα-mediated simultaneous transcription of hCYP1A1 and hCYP1A2. hCYP1A1 and hCYP1A2 mRNA levels were increased in human hepatoma HuH-7 cells and human primary hepatocytes, respectively, after treatment with the LXRα ligand GW3965. Our results suggest that LXRα transactivates the expression of hCYP1A1 and hCYP1A2 through common two cis-elements.
CFTR function is tightly regulated by many interacting proteins.
DHCR24 (3β-hydroxysterol Δ(24)-reductase) catalyses the reduction of the C-24 double bond of sterol intermediates during cholesterol biosynthesis. DHCR24 has also been involved in cell growth, senescence and cellular response to oncogenic and oxidative stress. Despite its important roles, little is known about the transcriptional mechanisms controlling DHCR24 gene expression. We analysed the proximal promoter region and the cholesterol-mediated regulation of DHCR24. A putative SRE (sterol-regulatory element) at -98/-90 bp of the transcription start site was identified. Other putative regulatory elements commonly found in SREBP (SRE-binding protein)-targeted genes were also identified. Sterol responsiveness was analysed by luciferase reporter assays of approximately 1 kb 5'-flanking region of the human DHCR24 gene in HepG2 and SK-N-MC cells. EMSAs (electrophoretic mobility-shift assays) and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays demonstrated cholesterol-dependent recruitment and binding of SREBPs to the putative SRE. Given the presence of several CACCC-boxes in the DHCR24 proximal promoter, we assessed the role of KLF5 (Krüppel-like factor 5) in androgen-regulated DHCR24 expression. DHT (dihydrotestosterone) increased DHCR24 expression synergistically with lovastatin. However, DHT was unable to activate the DHCR24 proximal promoter, whereas KLF5 did, indicating that this mechanism is not involved in the androgen-induced stimulation of DHCR24 expression. The results of the present study allow the elucidation of the mechanism of regulation of the DHCR24 gene by cholesterol availability and identification of other putative cis-acting elements which may be relevant for the regulation of DHCR24 expression.
ABCA1 is known to suppress proinflammatory cytokines.
G6PC3 deficiency is a new neutropenic syndrome, which is characterized by severe persistent neutropenia, early onset infections and additional organ involvement, especially cardiac and urogenital malformations.
MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism is a genetic alteration in an enzyme involved in folate metabolism, but its effect on host susceptibility to cervical cancer is still uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism and cervical cancer by performing a meta-analysis.
PIK3CA mutations may predict response to PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in patients with advanced cancers, but the relevance of mutation subtype has not been investigated. Patients with diverse cancers referred to the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy were analyzed for PIK3CA and, if possible, KRAS mutations. Patients with PIK3CA mutations were treated, whenever possible, with agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Overall, 105 (10%) of 1,012 patients tested harbored PIK3CA mutations. Sixty-six (median 3 prior therapies) of the 105 PIK3CA-mutant patients, including 16 individuals (of 55 PIK3CA-mutant patients tested) with simultaneous KRAS mutations, were treated on a protocol that included a PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitor; 17% (11/66) achieved a partial response (PR). Patients with a PIK3CA H1047R mutation compared with patients who had other PIK3CA mutations or patients with wild-type PIK3CA treated on the same protocols had a higher PR rate (6/16, 38% vs. 5/50; 10% vs. 23/174, 13%, respectively; all P ≤ 0.02). None of the 16 patients with coexisting PIK3CA and KRAS mutations in codon 12 or 13 attained a PR (0/16, 0%). Patients treated with combination therapy versus single-agent therapies had a higher PR rate (11/38, 29% vs. 0/28, 0%; P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that H1047R was the only independent factor predicting response [OR 6.6, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-43.0, P = 0.047). Our data suggest that interaction between PIK3CA mutation H1047R versus other aberrations and response to PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis inhibitors warrants further exploration.
ABO genotyping have become common tools for forensic casework. We developed a new rapid ABO genotyping method using a fast real-time PCR system with the TaqMan® Sample-to-SNP™ Kit. Eight single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites in the ABO gene (nt 261, 297, 467, 657, 703, 829, 930 and 1061) were selected to determine the ABO genotypes. ABO genotypes were easily determined by examining allelic discrimination patterns. This method enabled analyses to be completed in about 1h per plate with no postmortem change influences. The detection limit in each SNP site was examined as 100pg per reaction. ABO genotyping from 1000 Japanese individuals was also examined to determine the distribution of ABO genotypes and allele frequencies. Thus, 31 genotypes were clearly identified, and these were controlled by four common and seven rare alleles. The power of discrimination, heterozygosity and polymorphism information contents were 0.913, 0.775 and 0.812, respectively. Therefore, selecting these eight SNP sites could be useful for high specific ABO genotyping. This rapid, sensitive and accurate genotyping method is useful for forensic casework.
CYP2E1 is an important enzyme oxidizing ethanol as well as several drugs and other xenobiotics in the human liver. We determined the inhibition potency of structurally diverse compounds against human CYP2E1, and analyzed their interactions with the enzyme active site by molecular docking and 3D-QSAR approaches. The IC(50) values for the tested compounds varied from 1.4 μM for γ-undecanolactone to over 46 mM for glycerol. This data set was used to create a comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) model. The most important interactions for binding of inhibitors were identified by docking and key features for inhibitors were characterized via the COMFA model. Since the active site of CYP2E1 is flexible, long chain lactones and alkyl alcohols fitted best into the larger open form while the other compounds fitted better in the smaller closed form of the active site. Electrostatic interactions near the Thr(303) residue proved to be important for inhibition of the enzyme activity. Thus, docking analysis and the predictive CoMFA model proved to be efficient tools for revealing interactions between inhibiting compounds and CYP2E1. These approaches can be used to analyze CYP2E1-mediated metabolism and drug interactions in the development of new chemical entities.
HSD17B12 is a member of the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase superfamily, a multifunctional group of enzymes involved in the metabolism of steroids, retinoids, bile and fatty acids. Whether the main role of HSD17B12 in mammals is in steroid or fatty acid metabolism is a subject of intense debate. In mollusks it has been shown that an HSD17B12 orthologue can convert estrone into estradiol in vitro, although its primary in vivo function remains unknown. To gain insight into its role in gastropods, we provide here the first cloning of Hsd17b12 in Nucella lapillus and its detailed tissue distribution through quantitative PCR. Furthermore, given that the endocrine disruptor tributyltin (TBT) has been reported to unbalance steroid and lipid levels in gastropods, we tested its impact in on NlHsd17b12 transcript expression. Our results show that NlHsd17b12 is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues analyzed, with higher levels in organs with high metabolic rates, such as kidney and digestive gland, a pattern consistent with an involvement in lipid metabolism. Exposure to TBT chloride at 100 ng Sn/L caused a decrease in NlHsd17b12 mRNA levels in digestive gland, after one and two months, while no effect was observed in gonads. Overall, these results suggest that in mollusks, as in mammals, this enzyme is likely to be involved in lipid metabolism, and emphasize the need to perform more detailed studies on its in vivo function, in order to understand its physiological role and the biological impact of its disruption by pollutants such as TBT.
GSTM1 and GSTT1 are involved in the detoxification of carcinogens such as smoking by-products, and polymorphisms in these two genes with a result of loss of enzyme activity may increase risk of carcinogenesis. Although many epidemiological studies have investigated the association between GSTM1 or GSTT1 null genotype and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the results remain conflicting. To elucidate the overall association of GSTM1, GSTT1 and HNSCC, we included all available studies and performed this meta-analysis.
CYP4A11 converts arachidonic acid to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), which has a crucial role in the modulation of cardiovascular homeostasis. We assessed the association between the human CYP4A11 gene and coronary artery disease (CAD) in Han and Uygur populations in China.
CYP2E1 activates several hepatotoxins and contributes to alcoholic liver damage. In this report, we review our studies on whether induction of CYP2E1 can potentiate liver injury in obesity. Acetone- or pyrazole-induced severe liver injury in obese mice as compared to obese controls and lean mice. Severe liver injury was associated with elevated oxidative and nitrosative stress and could be blunted by inhibitors of CYP2E1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) lowered the elevated oxidative and nitrosative stress, steatosis, liver injury and mitochondrial dysfunction in the pyrazole-treated obese mice. The protection by SAM may have therapeutic applications against metabolic complications caused by obesity. The role of CYP2E1 in chronic ethanol-induced liver injury was studied using wild-type (WT) mice, CYP2E1 knockout (KO) mice and humanized CYP2E1 knockin (KI) mice. Ethanol produced fatty liver and oxidant stress in WT mice; these effects were blunted in the CYP2E1 KO mice but restored in the CYP2E1 KI mice. Significant liver injury was produced in the ethanol-fed KI mice in association with elevated oxidant stress and levels of human CYP2E1. Collectively, these studies show that CYP2E1 contributes to ethanol-induced and obesity-induced oxidant stress and liver injury.
"MAOA and, to a lesser extent, MAOB polymorphisms have been related to aggression traits and suicidality. We aimed to investigate the role of MAOA and MAOB in suicidal versus non-suicidal participants and interactions between genetic variation and suicidal status on aggression and anger-related traits. The sample was composed of three groups: one group of suicide attempters (n = 171, males 35.1 %), one group of suicide completers (n = 90, males 57.8 %) and a healthy control group (n = 317, males 43.8 %). We examined the following markers: MAOA rs909525, rs6323, and rs2064070, and MAOB rs1799836. Anger traits were measured with the state-trait anger expression inventory (STAXI) and aggression traits with the questionnaire for measuring factors of aggression (FAF). Associations were separately examined for males and females. Variation in the three MAOA variants was associated with higher levels of anger expressed outwards (STAXI ""anger-out"" subscale) in male suicidal patients compared to controls (p < 0.001). In females, the C allele of rs6323 showed higher scores on the same subscale (""anger out"") (p = 0.002). Allele frequencies of the MAOA rs909525 were associated with suicidality (p < 0.007). Our findings show an association between genetic variation in three polymorphisms of the MAOA and anger traits in suicidal males and one replication for the functional variant rs6323 in females. This relationship was stronger than a direct genetic association with suicide status. Future studies incorporating endophenotypic measures of anger and aggression in suicidal participants are warranted."
NPR1 is a gene of Arabidopsis thaliana required for the perception of salicylic acid. This perception triggers a defense response and negatively regulates the perception of jasmonates. Surprisingly, the application of methyl jasmonate also induces resistance, and NPR1 is also suspected to be relevant. Since an allelic series of npr1 was recently described, the behavior of these alleles was tested in response to methyl jasmonate.
TK1 found to be elevated biomarker in many solid cancers.
PTEN is a well-defined tumor suppressor gene that antagonizes the PI3K/Akt pathway to regulate a multitude of cellular processes, such as survival, growth, motility, invasiveness, and angiogenesis. While the functions of PTEN have been studied extensively, the regulation of its activity during normal and disease conditions still remains incompletely understood. In this study, we identified the protein phosphatase-1 nuclear targeting subunit PNUTS (PPP1R10) as a PTEN-associated protein. PNUTS directly interacted with the lipid-binding domain (C2 domain) of PTEN and sequestered it in the nucleus. Depletion of PNUTS leads to increased apoptosis and reduced cellular proliferation in a PTEN-dependent manner. PNUTS expression was elevated in certain cancers compared with matched normal tissues. Collectively, our studies reveal PNUTS as a novel PTEN regulator and a likely oncogene.
GNE myopathy, previously termed hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), is an adult-onset neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness. The disorder results from biallelic mutations in GNE, encoding UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase, the key enzyme of sialic acid synthesis. GNE myopathy, associated with impaired glycan sialylation, has no approved therapy. Here we test potential sialylation-increasing monosaccharides for their effectiveness in prophylaxis (at the embryonic and neonatal stages) and therapy (after the onset of symptoms) by evaluating renal and muscle hyposialylation in a knock-in mouse model (Gne p.M712T) of GNE myopathy. We demonstrate that oral mannosamine (ManN), but not sialic acid (Neu5Ac), mannose (Man), galactose (Gal), or glucosamine (GlcN), administered to pregnant female mice has a similar prophylactic effect on renal hyposialylation, pathology and neonatal survival of mutant offspring, as previously shown for N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) therapy. ManN may be converted to ManNAc by a direct, yet unknown, pathway, or may act through another mode of action. The other sugars (Man, Gal, GlcN) may either not cross the placental barrier (Neu5Ac) and/or may not be able to directly increase sialylation. Because GNE myopathy patients will likely require treatment in adulthood after onset of symptoms, we also administered ManNAc (1 or 2g/kg/day for 12 weeks), Neu5Ac (2 g/kg/day for 12 weeks), or ManN (2 g/kg/day for 6 weeks) in drinking water to 6 month old mutant Gne p.M712T mice. All three therapies markedly improved the muscle and renal hyposialylation, as evidenced by lectin histochemistry for overall sialylation status and immunoblotting of specific sialoproteins. These preclinical data strongly support further evaluation of oral ManNAc, Neu5Ac and ManN as therapy for GNE myopathy and conceivably for certain glomerular diseases with hyposialylation.
PTEN gene (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten, MIM 601628) is a tumor suppressor gene implicated in PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes (PHTS) including Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome and Proteus-like syndrome. PTEN mutations have been more recently reported in children with macrocephaly and autism spectrum disorders or mental retardation, without other symptoms of PHTS. Although tumor risk has not been evaluated in these patients and their relatives, the same surveillance as for Cowden syndrome is usually proposed. We report a family including patients carrying a novel PTEN mutation and presenting with a mild phenotype consisting of macrocephaly, hypotonia during the first year of life and mild learning disabilities, without autistic features. None of these patients exhibited PTHS-related symptoms such as tumors, lipomas, vascular malformations or pigmented macules of the glans penis. This report raises the question of extending the indications of PTEN mutation screening to familial macrocephaly with learning disabilities. Detection of a mutation in this family led to difficult questions about surveillance, genetic counseling and familial information since the mother declined tumor screening and disclosure of genetic risk information to at-risk relatives.
GNE myopathy is a rare and mildly progressive autosomal recessive myopathy caused by GNE mutations. Respiratory dysfunction has not been reported in GNE myopathy patients. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the respiratory function of 39 severely affected GNE myopathy patients (13 men, 26 women) from medical records, and compared these parameters with various other patient characteristics (e.g., GNE mutations, age at onset, creatine kinase levels, and being wheelchair-bound) for correlations. The mean % forced vital capacity [FVC] was 92 (26) (range, 16-128). In 12/39 (31%) patients, %FVC was <80%. Of these 12 patients, 11 (92%) were entirely wheelchair-dependent. These patients exhibited significantly earlier onset (20 [4] vs. 30 [8] years, p<0.001) and lower creatine kinase levels (56 [71] vs. 279 [185] IU/L) than patients with normal respiratory function. Two patients exhibited severe respiratory failure and required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Patients with a homozygous mutation in the N-acetylmannosamine kinase domain exhibited lower %FVC, while only one compound heterozygous patient with separate mutations in the uridinediphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase and the N-acetylmannosamine kinase domains had respiratory dysfunction. Our results collectively suggest that GNE myopathy can cause severe respiratory failure. Respiratory dysfunction should be carefully monitored in patients with advanced GNE myopathy characterized by early onset and homozygous homozygous mutations in the N-acetylmannosamine kinase domain.
ABO blood groups have been associated with various disease phenotypes, particularly cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular diseases are the most common causes of death in developed countries and their prevalence rate is rapidly growing in developing countries. There have been substantial historical associations between non-O blood group status and an increase in some cardiovascular disorders. Recent GWASs have identified ABO as a locus for thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and multiple cardiovascular risk biomarkers, refocusing attention on mechanisms and potential for clinical advances. As we highlight in this paper, more recent work is beginning to probe the molecular basis of the disease associations observed in these observational studies. Advances in our understanding of the physiologic importance of various endothelial and platelet-derived circulating glycoproteins are elucidating the mechanisms through which the ABO blood group may determine overall cardiovascular disease risk. The role of blood group antigens in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular disorders remains a fascinating subject with potential to lead to novel therapeutics and prognostics and to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular diseases.
FABP4 is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, and its circulating levels are linked with obesity and a poor atherogenic profile.
RRM2B is the DNA damage-inducible small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate synthesis. Although RRM2B is implicated in DNA repair and the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA content, the regulation and function of RRM2B in senescence have not been previously established. Here, we show that RRM2B is highly induced in a p53-dependent manner during senescence in primary human fibroblast IMR90 cells and is expressed at higher levels in senescent precancerous human prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm lesions compared to adjacent normal prostate glands. Paradoxically, silencing RRM2B expression leads to an increase in the level of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and premature senescence in a p38MAPK- and p53-dependent manner in young fibroblasts. Consistently, induction of senescence is accelerated in Rrm2b deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts. Our data demonstrate that RRM2B is induced by stress signals prior to the onset of senescence and prevents premature oxidative stress-induced senescence.
CAD is a 243 kDa eukaryotic multifunctional polypeptide that catalyzes the first three reactions of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis: glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase and dihydroorotase (DHO). In prokaryotes, these activities are associated with monofunctional proteins, for which crystal structures are available. However, there is no detailed structural information on the full-length CAD protein or any of its functional domains apart from that it associates to form a homohexamer of ∼1.5 MDa. Here, the expression, purification and crystallization of the DHO domain of human CAD are reported. The DHO domain forms homodimers in solution. Crystallization experiments yielded small crystals that were suitable for X-ray diffraction studies. A diffraction data set was collected to 1.75 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation at the SLS, Villigen, Switzerland. The crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group C222(1), with unit-cell parameters a=82.1, b=159.3, c=61.5 Å. The Matthews coefficient calculation suggested the presence of one protein molecule per asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 48%.
ABCC1 is a member of the ATP-binding Cassette super family of transporters, actively effluxes xenobiotics from cells. Clinically, ABCC1 expression is linked to cancer multidrug resistance. Substrate efflux is energised by ATP binding and hydrolysis at the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and inhibition of these events may help combat drug resistance. The aim of this study is to identify potential inhibitors of ABCC1 through virtual screening of National Cancer Institute (NCI) compounds. A threedimensional model of ABCC1 NBD2 was generated using MODELLER whilst the X-ray crystal structure of ABCC1 NBD1 was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank. A pharmacophore hypothesis was generated based on flavonoids known to bind at the NBDs using PHASE, and used to screen the NCI database. GLIDE was employed in molecular docking studies for all hit compounds identified by pharmacophore screening. The best potential inhibitors were identified as compounds possessing predicted binding affinities greater than ATP. Approximately 5% (13/265) of the hit compounds possessed lower docking scores than ATP in ABCC1 NBD1 (NSC93033, NSC662377, NSC319661, NSC333748, NSC683893, NSC226639, NSC94231, NSC55979, NSC169121, NSC166574, NSC73380, NSC127738, NSC115534), whereas approximately 7% (7/104) of docked NCI compounds were predicted to possess lower docking scores than ATP in ABCC1 NBD2 (NSC91789, NSC529483, NSC211168, NSC318214, NSC116519, NSC372332, NSC526974). Analyses of docking orientations revealed P-loop residues of each NBD and the aromatic amino acids Trp653 (NBD1) and Tyr1302 (NBD2) were key in interacting with high-affinity compounds. On the basis of docked orientation and docking score the compounds identified may be potential inhibitors of ABCC1 and require further pharmacological analysis.
PTEN (Phosphatase and tensin homolog) is a tumour suppressor gene commonly defective in human cancer, and is thus a potentially important therapeutic target. Targeting tumour suppressor loss-of-function is possible by exploiting the genetic concept of synthetic lethality (SL). By combining the use of isogenic models of PTEN deficiency with high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screening, we have identified Nemo-Like Kinase (NLK) inhibition as being synthetically lethal with PTEN deficiency. This SL is likely mediated by the transcription factor FOXO1 (Forkhead box O1), an NLK substrate, as the selectivity of NLK gene silencing for PTEN deficient cells can be reversed by FOXO1 knockdown. In addition, we provide evidence that PTEN defective cells targeted by NLK gene depletion undergo senescence, suggesting that NLK function is critical for the continued proliferation of PTEN deficient cells. Taken together, these data provide new insight into the potential of targeting of NLK to treat a range of tumourigenic conditions characterised by PTEN deficiency.
CYP2C9 encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes which play a central role in activating and detoxifying many carcinogens and endogenous compounds thought to be involved in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). In the past decade, the relationship between CYP2C9 common polymorphisms (R144C and I359L) and CRC has been reported in various ethnic groups; however, these studies have yielded contradictory results. To investigate this inconsistency, we performed this meta-analysis.
ABCA1 genetic variation is known to play a role in HDL-C levels and various studies have also implicated ABCA1 variation in cardiovascular risk. The functional ABCA1/R230C variant is frequent in the Mexican population and has been consistently associated with low HDL-C concentrations. Although it has been associated with other cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, it is not known whether it is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD).
FIG4 (Sac3 in mammals) is a 5'-phosphoinositide phosphatase that coordinates the turnover of phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P(2)), a very low abundance phosphoinositide. Deficiency of FIG4 severely affects the human and mouse nervous systems by causing two distinct forms of abnormal lysosomal storage. The first form occurs in spinal sensory neurons, where vacuolated endolysosomes accumulate in perinuclear regions. A second form occurs in cortical/spinal motor neurons and glia, in which enlarged endolysosomes become filled with electron dense materials in a manner indistinguishable from other lysosomal storage disorders. Humans with a deficiency of FIG4 (known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J or CMT4J) present with clinical and pathophysiological phenotypes indicative of spinal motor neuron degeneration and segmental demyelination. These findings reveal a signaling pathway involving FIG4 that appears to be important for lysosomal function. In this review, we discuss the biology of FIG4 and describe how the deficiency of FIG4 results in lysosomal phenotypes. We also discuss the implications of FIG4/PI(3,5)P(2) signaling in understanding other lysosomal storage diseases, neuropathies, and acquired demyelinating diseases.
SLC5A8 (solute carrier gene family 5A, member 8) is a sodium-coupled transporter for monocarboxylates. Among its substrates are the HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors butyrate, propionate and pyruvate. Expression of SLC5A8 is silenced in cancers via DNA methylation, and ectopic expression of SLC5A8 in cancer cells induces apoptosis in the presence of its substrates that are HDAC inhibitors. In the present study we show that ectopic expression of SLC5A8 in cancer cells translocates the anti-apoptotic protein survivin to the plasma membrane through protein-protein interaction resulting in depletion of nuclear survivin and also decreases cellular levels of survivin through inhibition of transcription. These SLC5A8-induced changes in the location and levels of survivin result in cell-cycle arrest, disruption of the chromosome passenger complex involved in mitosis, induction of apoptosis and enhancement in chemosensitivity. These effects are seen independently of the transport function of SLC5A8 and histone acetylation status of the cell; in the presence of pyruvate, a SLC5A8 substrate and also an HDAC inhibitor, these effects are amplified. Ectopic expression of SLC5A8 in the breast cancer cell line MB231 inhibits the ability of cells to form colonies in vitro and to form tumours in mouse xenografts in vivo. The suppression of survivin transcription occurs independently of HDAC inhibition, and the underlying mechanism is associated with decreased phosphorylation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). The observed effects are specific for survivin with no apparent changes in expression of other inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins. The present study unravels a novel, hitherto unrecognized, mechanism for the tumour-suppressive role of a plasma membrane transporter independent of its transport function.
ADA (alteration/deficiency in activation) 3 is a conserved component of several transcriptional adaptor and HAT (histone acetyltransferase) complexes that regulate RNA polymerase II-mediated gene expression. Within the HAT complexes ADA3 is associated with ADA2 and the HAT GCN5 (general control non-repressed 5). ADA3 plays roles in diverse cellular processes and also in malignancies by modulating GCN5 catalytic activity and/or by interactions with other regulators. To gain a better understanding of ADA3 function, we used a yeast two-hybrid approach to screen a human fetal cDNA library for proteins that interacted with hADA3 (human ADA3). We identified three novel hADA3-interacting partners, a transcriptional regulator, AATF (apoptosis-antagonizing transcription factor), and regulatory subunits of the PP1 (protein phosphatase 1) and PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A) [PPP1R7 (PP1 regulatory subunit 7) and PPP2R5D (PP2A 56 kDa regulatory subunit δ isoform) respectively]. Analysis of truncated versions of hADA3 indicated that the C-terminal ADA2-interacting domain was not required for these interactions. Fluorescent microscopy analysis and co-immunoprecipitation provided support for the co-localization and interaction of hADA3 with these proteins in human cells. Expression of the interacting proteins altered expression of an hADA3-regulated reporter gene, suggesting functional consequences for the interactions. The detected interactions of hADA3 might extend the spectrum of mechanisms by which ADA3 can contribute to the regulation of gene expression and shed light on processes mediated by these newly identified ADA3 partners.
PTEN phosphatase is a tumor suppressor controlling notably cell growth, proliferation and survival. The multisite phosphorylation of the PTEN C-terminal tail regulates PTEN activity and intracellular trafficking. The dynamical nature of such regulatory events represents a crucial dimension for timing cellular decisions. Here we show that NMR spectroscopy allows reporting on the order and kinetics of clustered multisite phosphorylation events. We first unambiguously identify in vitro seven bona fide sites modified by CK2 and GSK3β kinases and two new sites on the PTEN C-terminal tail. Then, monitoring the formation of transient intermediate phosphorylated states, we determine the sequence of these reactions and calculate their apparent rate constants. Finally, we assess the dynamic formation of these phosphorylation events induced by endogenous kinases directly in extracts of human neuroblastoma cells. Taken together, our data indicate that two cascades of events controlled by CK2 and GSK3β occur independently on two clusters of sites (S380-S385 and S361-S370) and that in each cluster the reactions follow an ordered model with a distributive kinetic mechanism. Besides emphasizing the ability of NMR to quantitatively and dynamically follow post-translational modifications, these results bring a temporal dimension on the establishment of PTEN phosphorylation cascades.
CD36 may play an important role in removal of oxidized LDLs from plasma, protein glycation, the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and diabetic micro- and macroangiopathy. Some reports have pointed to decreased expression of macrophages in association with mutations of the CD36 gene in hyperglycemic and obese subjects. The aim of the study was to search for an association between CD36 gene polymorphism and carbohydrate metabolism disturbances or variability of plasma soluble CD36 concentrations in obese children.
G6PC3 deficiency presents as a complex and heterogeneous syndrome that classically associates severe congenital neutropenia with cardiac and urogenital developmental defects. Here we investigate the findings of T cell lymphopenia and inflammatory bowel disease in a child with G6PC3 deficiency due to compound heterozygous mutations in intron 3 (c.IVS3-1 G>A) and exon 6 (c.G778G/C; p.Gly260/Arg).
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10) is a bona fide dual lipid and protein phosphatase with cytoplasmic (Cy) and nuclear localization. PTEN nuclear exclusion has been associated with tumorigenesis. Nucleophosmin (NPM1) is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and displays Cy localization in mutated nucleophosmin (NPMc+) AML. Here we show that NPM1 directly interacts with herpes virus-associated ubiquitin specific protease (HAUSP), which is known as a PTEN deubiquitinating enzyme. Strikingly, PTEN is aberrantly localized in AML carrying NPMc+. Mechanistically, NPM1 in the nucleus opposes HAUSP-mediated deubiquitination and this promotes the shuttle of PTEN to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, NPMc+ prevents HAUSP from deubiquitinating PTEN, causing the latter to stay in the cytoplasm where it is polyubiquitinated and degraded. Our findings delineate a new NPM1-HAUSP molecular interaction controlling PTEN deubiquitination and trafficking.
VNN1 gene expression levels and the G-137T polymorphism have been associated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in Mexican American adults. We aim to evaluate the contribution of VNN1 gene expression and the G-137T variant to HDL-C levels and other metabolic traits in Mexican prepubertal children.
WWOX is a tumor suppressor gene that maps to the common fragile site FRA16D and is involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression in many different carcinomas. Reduced WWOX expression is associated with more aggressive phenotypes and poor patient outcomes in several cancers. The present study was conducted in order to elucidate more precisely the genetic and epigenetic alterations of WWOX that play a role in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) carcinogenesis in a population from Northern China. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), PCR-simple sequence length polymorphism (PCR-SSLP), and methylation specific PCR (MSP) methods were used to characterize polymorphisms in the rs3764340, rs2548861, and rs1079635 loci, the level of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and methylation status of WWOX, respectively. Protein and mRNA expression of WWOX in GCA tissues was quantified by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Family history of upper gastrointestinal cancer (UGIC) significantly increased the risk of developing GCA. The CG+GG genotype of rs3764340 and GT or TT genotype of rs2548861 significantly elevated the risk of developing GCA. LOH at the WWOX locus was observed in 45.6% tumors. The promoter and exon 1 methylation frequency of WWOX in GCA tissues was significantly higher than in corresponding normal tissues and was associated with UGIC family history. Protein and mRNA expression of WWOX was reduced in GCA tumor tissues and was associated with LOH and methylation of the gene. These results indicate that WWOX may play an important role in GCA especially in individuals with UGIC family history.
CD36 signal transductions have been reported by a variety of lipid moiety of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), however, CD36 signal induced by 7-ketocholesteryl-9-carboxynonanoate (oxLig-1), a lipid moiety of oxLDL has not been elucidated.
NEU3 sialidase, a key enzyme in ganglioside metabolism, is activated under hypoxic conditions in cultured skeletal muscle cells (C2C12). NEU3 up-regulation stimulates the EGF receptor signaling pathway, which in turn activates the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), resulting in a final increase of cell survival and proliferation. In the same cells, stable overexpression of sialidase NEU3 significantly enhances cell resistance to hypoxia, whereas stable silencing of the enzyme renders cells more susceptible to apoptosis. These data support the working hypothesis of a physiological role played by NEU3 sialidase in protecting cells from hypoxic stress and may suggest new directions in the development of therapeutic strategies against ischemic diseases, particularly of the cerebro-cardiovascular system.
CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in airway smooth muscle cells. The enzymatic activity of CD38 generates cyclic ADP-ribose from β-NAD. Cyclic ADP-ribose mobilizes intracellular calcium during activation of airway smooth muscle cells by G-protein-coupled receptors through activation of ryanodine receptor channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Inflammatory cytokines that are implicated in asthma upregulate CD38 expression and increase the calcium responses to contractile agonists in airway smooth muscle cells. The augmented intracellular calcium responses following cytokine exposure of airway smooth muscle cells are inhibited by an antagonist of cyclic ADP-ribose. Airway smooth muscle cells from CD38 knockout mice exhibit attenuated intracellular calcium responses to agonists, and these mice have reduced airway response to inhaled methacholine. CD38 also contributes to airway hyperresponsiveness as shown in mouse models of allergen or cytokine-induced inflammatory airway disease. In airway smooth muscle cells obtained from asthmatics, the cytokine-induced CD38 expression is significantly enhanced compared to expression in cells from nonasthmatics. This differential induction of CD38 expression in asthmatic airway smooth muscle cells stems from increased activation of MAP kinases and transcription through NF-κB, and altered post-transcriptional regulation through microRNAs. We propose that increased capacity for CD38 signaling in airway smooth muscle in asthma contributes to airway hyperresponsiveness.
IDH2 encodes a mitochondrial metabolic enzyme that converts isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) by reducing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP(+)) to NADPH and participates in the citric acid cycle for energy production. Notably, this gene has been shown to be critical for cell proliferation. The abnormal expression of IDH2 has been reported in several types of cancer, and mutations in IDH2 have been identified in gliomas and acute myelogenous leukemia. The overexpression of IDH2 has been reported in endometrial, prostate and testicular cancer as well as in Kashin-Beck disease. In this study, we observed that IDH2 expression was significantly downregulated in early phase but was upregulated in advanced phase colon carcinoma compared to peritumoral tissues. In addition, we demonstrated that the growth of a colon carcinoma cell line was inhibited by IDH2-siRNA and increased following transfection with an IDH2-overexpressing plasmid. These results indicate that IDH2 may play a unique role in the development of colon carcinoma.
ALDH1A1 metabolizes a variety of endogenous and exogenous aldehyde, and also oxidizes retinol to synthesize retinoic acid and modulate cell differentiation. Moreover, ALDH1A1 is also suggested to participate in the maintenance of cancer stem cells. To investigate the potential role of ALDH1A1 in carcinogenesis of the lung, the present study examined two hundred and sixty eight cases of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) for its immunohistochemical expression and analyzed associations between ALDH1A1 levels and a series of clinicopathologic parameters. Also, the biological significance of the aberrant expression of ALDH1A1 was investigated in vitro. ALDH1A1 expression was markedly reduced in 39.9% (107/268) of NSCLCs. The incidence of this reduction was significantly higher in adenocarcinomas (ADC: 41.6%, 85/207) and large cell carcinomas (61.1%, 11/18) than squamous cell carcinomas (25.5%, 11/43). Among ADCs, the downregulation tended to be more remarkable in high grade, poorly differentiated tumors, and tumors with stronger proliferating activity. It also occurred with a significantly higher incidence in smokers than non-smokers. Forced expression of ALDH1A1 in NSCLC cell lines, which had lost ALDH1A1 expression, markedly attenuated their growth. Taken together, loss of ALDH1A1 expression is suggested to promote carcinogenesis especially in the smoking-related ADCs.
GNE myopathy is a recessive adult onset, slowly progressive distal and proximal myopathy, caused by mutations in the GNE gene. The most frequent mutation in GNE myopathy patients is the Middle Eastern founder mutation M712T. We have generated Gne (M712T/M712T) knockin mice. A high mortality rate in the first generation due to renal failure was recorded (as previously described). However, the following Gne (M712T/M712T) offspring generations could be classified into 3 phenotypic categories: severe, mild and without apparent phenotype. By further crossing between mice with no apparent phenotype, we were able to establish a colony of Gne (M712T/M712T) knockin mice with a high- and long-term survival rate, lacking any renal phenotype. These mice did not present any muscle phenotype (clinical or pathological) for up to 18 months. No correlation was found between the expression of any of the two mRNA Gne isoforms in muscle and the mouse genotype or phenotype. However, the expression of isoform 2 mRNA was significantly higher in the kidney of Gne (M712T/M712T) kidney affected mice compared with control. In contrast, the expression of UPR markers Bip, Chop and of the spliced form of XBP1, was upregulated in muscle of Gne (M712T/M712T) mice compared with controls, but was unchanged in the affected kidney. Thus, Gne defects can affect both muscle and kidney in mouse, but probably through different mechanisms.
ADA is an enzyme implicated in purine metabolism, and is critical to ensure normal immune function. Its congenital deficit leads to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). ADA binding to adenosine receptors on dendritic cell surface enables T-cell costimulation through CD26 crosslinking, which enhances T-cell activation and proliferation. Despite a large body of work on the actions of the ecto-enzyme ADA on T-cell activation, questions arise on whether ADA can also modulate dendritic cell maturation. To this end we investigated the effects of ADA on human monocyte derived dendritic cell biology. Our results show that both the enzymatic and non-enzymatic activities of ADA are implicated in the enhancement of CD80, CD83, CD86, CD40 and CCR7 expression on immature dendritic cells from healthy and HIV-infected individuals. These ADA-mediated increases in CD83 and costimulatory molecule expression is concomitant to an enhanced IL-12, IL-6, TNF-α, CXCL8(IL-8), CCL3(MIP1-α), CCL4(MIP-1β) and CCL5(RANTES) cytokine/chemokine secretion both in healthy and HIV-infected individuals and to an altered apoptotic death in cells from HIV-infected individuals. Consistently, ADA-mediated actions on iDCs are able to enhance allogeneic CD4 and CD8-T-cell proliferation, globally yielding increased iDC immunogenicity. Taken together, these findings suggest that ADA would promote enhanced and correctly polarized T-cell responses in strategies targeting asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals.
PIK3CA mutations are frequently diagnosed in diverse cancers and may predict response to PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors. It remains unclear whether they are associated with other characteristics. We analyzed characteristics and outcome of 90 consecutive patients with diverse advanced tumors and PIK3CA mutations and 180 wild-type PIK3CA controls matched by tumor type, gender, and age referred to the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy. PIK3CA and MAPK mutations (KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF) were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-based DNA sequencing. The most frequent PIK3CA mutations were E545K (31/90, 34%), E542K (16/90, 18%) in exon 9, and H1047R (20/90, 22%) in exon 20. PIK3CA mutations compared to wild-type PIK3CA were associated with simultaneous KRAS (p=0.047) and MAPK mutations (p=0.03), but only MAPK mutations were confirmed as having an independent association in multivariate analysis. Rates of lung, bone, liver and brain metastases were similar in PIK3CA-mutant and wild-type patients. Patients with PIK3CA mutations treated on trials with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors had a higher partial/complete response (PR/CR) rate than wild-type PIK3CA patients treated with their best phase I therapy (10/56, 18% vs. 12/152, 8%; p=0.045), but not a prolonged progression-free survival. Patients with H1047R PIK3CA mutations had higher PR/CR rate with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors compared to wild-type PIK3CA patients treated with their best phase I therapy (6/16, 38% vs. 12/152, 8%; p=0.003). In conclusion, PIK3CA mutations in diverse cancers were not associated with clinical characteristics, but were correlated with MAPK mutations. PIK3CA mutations, especially, H1047R, were associated with attaining a PR/CR to PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors.
ACE and vacancy affinity capillary electrophoresis (VACE) are the commonly used methods for determination of complexation constants by CE. The applicability and limitations of these methods were tested experimentally and by means of simulations using our simulation software Simul 5 Complex. It was shown that while the ACE method provides reliable and precise values of complexation parameters, those determined by VACE can be incorrect especially in the case of strong complexation. The effective mobilities of the system peaks in the VACE method, and consequently, the resulting complexation parameters were found to be a function of concentration of the analyte present in the BGE. Development of system peaks in VACE is discussed in the frame of the linear theory of electromigration. Dependence of mobility of system peaks on the composition of the BGE cannot be characterized by a simple analytical expression as in the case of ACE method. Thus, the VACE method fails and the resulting complexation constants might seriously differ from the reality.
CFTR exon 10 and its flanking regions are duplicated in the human genome. These duplications present mutations compared to the normal exon 10 sequence. Due to the polymorphic sequence of the 3' intron 9 sequence, it may appear difficult to sequence exon 10 and some mutations described in this exon could, in fact, be variations observed in an ectopic duplicated sequence. In our previous work we described a methodology to carry out PCR only of exon 10 and not of ectopic regions. In this work, we analyzed mutations described in the CF data base as being CFTR mutations but also found in ectopic regions: c.1392G>T, c.1338_1339delAT, c.1235delC, and c.1247A>G. We have shown that these mutations appear to be authentic mutations in CFTR exon 10 and not ectopic variations in analyzed patients. These mutations validate the usefulness of our new strategy in the mutation analysis of this region of CFTR.
MTHFR is a key enzyme in folate metabolism that catalyzes the conversion of 5, 10&mdash;methlenetetrahydrofolate (5, 10&mdash; methylene THF) to 5&mdash;methyltetrahydrofolate (5&mdash;methyl THF), a predominant circulatory form of folate and methyl donor for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Some studies have shown that C667T polymorphism increases the risk of pancreatic cancer. Since MTHFR is involved in methylation, inflammation and protection against oxidative stress, the processes especially important for pancreatic homeostasis. The altered enzyme activity could play a role in pancreatic injury. The role of MTHFR C677T polymorphism in chronic pancreatitis has been explored by conducting a hospital based; case&mdash;control study involving 100 patients radiologically confirmed chronic pancreatitis and 329 healthy controls. All samples were analyzed for MTHFR C677T polymorphism using PCR&mdash;RFLP method. Restriction enzyme Hinf I was used to digest the 198 bp amplified product. The frequency of the MTHFR was 57.3%, 34.1% and 8.5% among cases compared with 87.2%,11.2% and 1.5% of controls for CC, CT and TT genotypes, respectively. The T Allele frequency was found significantly higher in patients than in controls. A significant association with T allele was observed with p&mdash;value (&lt; 0.0001) odds ratio 4.475 and (95% CI=2.961&mdash;7.046). It could be predisposing to the traditional risk factors such as diabetes, dietary, alcohal and smoking habit that are known to be associated with chronic pancreatitis. Additionally it was observed that smoking increases the risk of chronic pancreatitis by 4.1 times. The T allele frequency of MTHFR (C667T) was found to be a significant risk factor for chronic pancreatitis playing a crucial role in altered folate metabolsim.
GNE myopathy or hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is an ultra-rare severely disabling autosomal recessive adult onset muscle disease which affects roughly one to three individuals per million worldwide. Genetically, HIBM is caused by mutations in the glucosamine (UDP-N-acetyl)-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase gene (GNE), resulting in diminished enzyme function and reduced sialic acid biosynthesis. A founder variant GNE p.M712T was first described in patients of Iranian and Middle-Eastern descent living outside of Iran. Asymptomatic heterozygote or carrier frequency has been reported as high as 1 in 11 within the Persian-Jewish community residing in Los Angeles, CA. To investigate the prevalence of the p.M712T variant in Iran, we studied 792 samples collected from random individuals in Sangesar (Mahdishahr) in Northern Iran. DNA samples were obtained by buccal swab, and genotyping was performed by melting curve analysis. The results included 31 of 792 (3.91%) heterozygous carriers and 5 (0.31%) homozygotes for GNE p.M712T. All five homozygous individuals, age 30-64 years, were already symptomatic at the start of the study. Our findings suggest that the prevalence of GNE p.M712T is higher in the Sangesar population, comprised mostly of Muslim and Bahai descendants, compared with the general world population. Additional HIBM distribution studies are warranted within various subpopulations of Iran.
CYP1B1 encodes an estrogen enzyme that oxidizes 17β-estradiol to 4-hydroxyestradiol. The evidence demonstrates there may be a relationship between CYP1B1 and thyroid function. To date, no study has evaluated if genetic polymorphisms that regulate concentrations of serum FT3 and FT4 contribute to Polycyctic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). To identify polymorphisms in the CYP1B1 locus associated with PCOS, we genotyped three common polymorphisms across the CYP1B1 locus in 226 patients. A test for association of common variants with susceptibility to PCOS was conducted in a large cohort of 609 subjects. The functional polymorphism CYP1B1 L432V (rs1056836) is associated with serum T4 (P = 0.003), serum FT3 (P < 0.001) and serum FT4 concentrations (P < 0.001). Our study provides the first evidence that genetic variants in CYP1B1 can be associated with serum T4, FT4 and FT3 levels in PCOS. These findings imply novel pathophysiological links between the CYP1B1 locus and thyroid function in PCOS.
MTHFR polymorphism testing is frequently ordered by physicians as part of the clinical evaluation for thrombophilia. It was previously hypothesized that reduced enzyme activity of MTHFR led to mild hyperhomocysteinemia which led to an increased risk for venous thromboembolism, coronary heart disease, and recurrent pregnancy loss. Recent meta-analyses have disproven an association between hyperhomocysteinemia and risk for coronary heart disease and between MTHFR polymorphism status and risk for venous t-hromboembolism. There is growing evidence that MTHFR polymorphism testing has minimal clinical utility and, therefore should not be ordered as a part of a routine evaluation for thrombophilia.
CD36 is an integral membrane protein that mediates the cellular uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) through recognition of the oxidized glycerophospholipids (oxPLs) formed during LDL oxidation. We aimed to devise an assay system to detect binding between CD36 and oxLDL/oxPL without using recombinant proteins. A peptide corresponding to amino-acid residues 149-168 of mouse CD36 with biotin at its N-terminus (named biotin-CD36(149-168)) and variants of it were synthesized and immobilized onto streptavidin-coated plates. oxLDL labeled with Alexa-Fluor-488 bound specifically and saturably to immobilized biotin-CD36(149-168), but poorly or not at all to the variants, such as that with a scrambled amino-acid sequence. The binding of fluorescence-labeled oxLDL to biotin-CD36(149-168) was inhibited efficiently by an oxPL species, but not by a nonoxidized glycerophospholipid. This assay system using biotin-CD36(149-168) provides a convenient means not only of characterizing binding profiles between CD36 and oxLDL/oxPL but also of finding competitors for the binding.
MTHFR C677T and A1298C have been associated with the risk of having an infant with Down syndrome (DS), but results were conflicting. We performed this meta-analysis to derive a more precise estimation of the association between maternal MTHFR polymorphisms and DS.
CYP2E1 enzyme encoded by cyp2e1 gene plays an important role in metabolism of heterogeneous organics in mammalian liver cells. The transgenic plant with cyp2e1 can metabolize various low molecular weight organic pollutants. However, it is unclear the mechanism of expression control of cyp2e1 in transgenic plant. In this study, plasmid pSLD50-6 with cyp2e1 and pKH200 with gus as control were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 separately. Then, the cyp2e1 or gus genes were transferred into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and the transgenic plants were regenerated via Agrobacterium tumefaciens method. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze the cyp2e1 gene expression. The expression of cyp2e1 in transgenic tobacco with cyp2e1 decreased obviously treated by ethyl alcohol and reduced slightly by benzene and toluene, while it enhanced by acetone, formaldehyde and oxygen deficit in different levels. In addition, the gene expression of NADPH-P450 oxidoreductase and cytochrome b5 enzyme in the transgenic tobacco with cyp2e1 were increased significantly treated by benzene, which showed that NADPH-P450 oxidoreductase and cytochrome b5 enzyme in transgenic tobacco have relation with CYP2E1 detoxication process. It suggested that the NADPH-P450 oxidoreductase and cytochrome b5 enzyme in transgenic plant formed the requirement in mammalian and participated in the electron transport chain of CYP2E1 enzyme catalytic process.
PTEN plays a well-established role in the negative regulation of the PI3K pathway, which is frequently activated in several cancer types, including breast cancer. A nuclear function in the maintenance of chromosomal stability has been proposed for PTEN but is yet to be clearly defined. In order to improve understanding of the role of PTEN in mammary tumorigenesis in terms of a possible gene dosage effect, its PI3K pathway function and its association with p53, we undertook comprehensive analysis of PTEN status in 135 sporadic invasive ductal carcinomas. Four PTEN status groups were defined; complete loss (19/135, 14%), reduced copy number (19/135, 14%), normal (86/135, 64%) and complex (11/135, 8%). Whereas the PTEN complete loss status was significantly associated with estrogen receptor (ER) negativity (p=0.006) and in particular the basal-like phenotype (p<0.0001), a reduced PTEN copy number was not associated with hormone receptor status or a particular breast cancer subtype. Overall, PI3K pathway alteration was suggested to be involved in 59% (79/134) of tumors as assessed by human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression, PIK3CA mutation or a complete loss of PTEN. A complex PTEN status was identified in a tumor subgroup which displayed a specific, complex DNA profile at the PTEN locus with a strikingly similar highly rearranged pan-genomic profile. All of these tumors had relapsed and were associated with a poorer prognosis in the context of node negative disease (p=1.4 × 10(-13) ) thus may represent a tumor subgroup with a common molecular alteration which could be targeted to improve clinical outcome.
PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome (PHTS) encompasses several clinical syndromes with germline mutations in the PTEN tumour suppressor gene, including Cowden syndrome which is characterised by an increased risk of breast and thyroid cancers. Because PHTS is rare, data regarding cancer risks and genotype-phenotype correlations are limited. The objective of this study was to better define cancer risks in this syndrome with respect to the type and location of PTEN mutations.
CYP2D6 (cytochrome P450 2D6) is one of the most important enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and CYP2D6 gene variants may cause toxic effects of therapeutic drugs or treatment failure. In this research, a rapid and simple method for genotyping the most common mutant alleles in the Asian population (CYP2D6*1/*1, CYP2D6*1/*10, CYP2D6*10/*10, CYP2D6*1/*5, CYP2D6*5/*10, and CYP2D6*5/*5) was developed by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) combined with capillary electrophoresis (CE). We designed a second mismatch nucleotide next to the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site in allele-specific primers to increase the difference in PCR amplification. Besides, we established simulation equations to predict the CYP2D6 genotypes by analyzing the DNA patterns in the CE chromatograms. The multiplex PCR combined with CE method was applied to test 50 patients, and all of the test results were compared with the DNA sequencing method, long-PCR method and real-time PCR method. The correlation of the analytical results between the proposed method and other methods were higher than 90%, and the proposed method is superior to other methods for being able to simultaneous detection of SNPs and copy number variations (CNV). Furthermore, we compared the plasma concentration of aripiprazole (a CYP2D6 substrate) and its major metabolites with the genotype of 25 patients. The results demonstrate the proposed genotyping method is effective for estimating the activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme and shows potential for application in personalized medicine. Similar approach can be applied to simultaneous detection of SNPs and CNVs of other genes.
SLC2A9 is a strong genetic risk factor for hyperuricaemia and gout. SLC2A9 (GLUT9) is a high capacity urate transporter and reportedly transports glucose and fructose. Intake of fructose-containing beverages is associated with development of hyperuricaemia and gout.
SULT1A1 and SULT1A2 are encoded on the same chromatid, and exhibit a 96% amino acid similarity. To screen for genetic variants in these two closely related genes, SULT1A1 and SULT1A2 were directly sequenced in 50 healthy Koreans. A total of 30 variations were identified in SULT1A1: eight in exons, thirteen in introns, and nine in the 5'-untranslated region. With regard to SULT1A2, 21 variants were identified, comprising seven in exons, five in introns, and nine in the 5'-untranslated region. Among these 51 variations, one in SULT1A1 and eight in SULT1A2 were previously unidentified, which include three coding variants (SULT1A2 R37Q, 110G>A; SULT1A2 G50S, 148G>A; SULT1A2 F286L, 3819C>A) and one null allele (SULT1A2 E217Stop, 3542G>T). Two LD blocks, major haplotype structures, and 7 haplotype-tagging SNPs were determined together for SULT1A1 and SULT1A2 as a single set. Frequencies of common functional variants were compared among ethnic groups. Since these two SULT enzymes are on the same chromatid in a parallel direction with overlapping substrate specificities, a combined analysis using LD and haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will facilitate understanding of the variations in the sulfation reactions of a wide range of substrates, as compared with analysis of individual genes.
KMT2B (MLL2/WBP7) is a member of the MLL subfamily of H3K4-specific histone lysine methyltransferases (KMT2) and is vital for normal embryonic development in the mouse. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying KMT2B function, we focused on MagohB, which is controlled by a CpG island promoter. We show that in cells lacking Mll2-the gene encoding KMT2B-the MagohB promoter resides in inaccessible chromatin and is methylated. To dissect the molecular events leading to the establishment of silencing, we performed kinetic studies in Mll2-conditional-knockout embryonic stem cells. KMT2B depletion was followed by the loss of the active chromatin marks and progressive loss of RNA polymerase II binding with a concomitant downregulation of MagohB expression. Once the active chromatin marks were lost, the MagohB promoter was rapidly methylated. We demonstrate that in the presence of KMT2B, neither transcription elongation nor RNA polymerase II binding is required to maintain H3K4 trimethylation at the MagohB promoter and protect it from DNA methylation. Reexpression of KMT2B was sufficient to reinstate an active MagohB promoter. Our study provides a paradigm for the idea that KMT2 proteins are crucial components for establishing and maintaining the transcriptionally active and unmethylated state of CpG island promoters.
CYP2C19 is one of the principal enzymes involved in the metabolism of clopidogrel. The genes encoding CYP enzymes are polymorphic, with common alleles conferring reduced function. A loss-of-function allele, CYP2C19*2, is associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, particularly stent thrombosis, in patients with acute coronary syndromes who are receiving clopidogrel, especially among those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Newer, more potent P2Y12 inhibitors like prasugrel and ticagrelor have been introduced recently in the daily clinical practice with better cardiovascular outcome in these patients. The purpose of this review article is to provide information regarding the clinical use of CYP2C19 genotyping in patients requiring antiplatelet therapy.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) plays a pivotal role in controlling intracellular signaling for cell survival and proliferation by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway, and its dysfunction is associated with several neoplastic diseases. PTEN is frequently found mutated in many pathological conditions highlighting its importance in normal physiological function. Unlike several cellular proteins which are activated by phosphorylation, PTEN is inactivated upon phosphorylation by specific kinases which phosphorylate serine and threonine residues in its C-terminal region. Therefore, development of therapeutic agents that specifically target kinases and kinase-domain-containing proteins affecting PTEN would lead to the treatment of PTEN-related diseases.
ABO blood type locus has been reported to be an important genetic determinant of venous and arterial thrombosis in genome-wide association studies. We tested the hypothesis that ABO blood type alone and in combination with mutations in factor V Leiden R506Q and prothrombin G20210A is associated with the risk of venous thromboembolism and myocardial infarction in the general population.
CD36 is a versatile receptor known to play a central role in the development of atherosclerosis, the pathogenesis of malaria, and the removal of apoptotic cells. Remarkably, the short cytosolically exposed regions of CD36 lack identifiable motifs, which has hampered elucidation of its mode of signaling. Using a combination of phosphoprotein isolation, mass spectrometry, superresolution imaging, and gene silencing, we have determined that the receptor induces ligand internalization through a heteromeric complex consisting of CD36, β1 and/or β2 integrins, and the tetraspanins CD9 and/or CD81. This receptor complex serves to link CD36 to the adaptor FcRγ, which bears an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif. By coupling to FcRγ, CD36 is able to engage Src-family kinases and Syk, which in turn drives the internalization of CD36 and its bound ligands.
SUV39H1 is a histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-specific methyltransferase that is important for heterochromatin formation and the regulation of gene expression. Chaetocin specifically inhibits SUV39H1, resulted in H3K9 methylation reduction as well as reactivation of silenced genes in cancer cells. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors inhibit deacetylases and accumulate high levels of acetylation lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrated that treatment with chaetocin enhanced apoptosis in human leukemia HL60, KG1, Kasumi, K562, and THP1 cells. In addition, chaetocin induced the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (p15), E-cadherin (CDH1) and frizzled family receptor 9 (FZD9) through depletion of SUV39H1 and reduced H3K9 methylation in their promoters. Co-treatment with chaetocin and HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) dramatically increased apoptosis and produced greater activation of genes. Furthermore, this combined treatment significantly increased loss of SUV39H1 and reduced histone H3K9 trimethylation responses accompanied by increased acetylation. Importantly, co-treatment with chaetocin and TSA produced potent antileukemic effects in leukemia cells derived from patients. These in vitro findings suggest that combination therapy with SUV39H1 and HDAC inhibitors may be of potential value in the treatment of leukemia.
UGT1A1 enzyme defects are responsible of both Gilbert syndrome (GS) and Crigler-Najjar syndrome (CNS). GS depends on a variant TATAA element (which contains two extra TA nucleotides as compared to the wild type genotype) in the UGT1A1 gene promoter resulting in a reduced gene expression. On the contrary, CNS forms are classified in two types depending on serum total bilirubin concentrations (STBC): the more severe (CNS-I) is characterized by high levels of STBC (342-684μmol/L), due to total deficiency of the UGT1A1 enzyme, while the milder one, namely CNS-II, is characterized by partial UGT1A1 deficiency with STBC ranging from 103 to 342μmol/L. GS and CNS are caused by genetic lesions involving a complex locus encoding the UGT1A1 gene. The present report provides an update of all reported UGT1A1 gene mutations associated to GS and CNS.
LIPA gene mutations result in deficiency of lysosomal acid lipase and present phenotypically as Wolman disease or cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) depending on the level of deficiency. Patients with CESD may often be misdiagnosed because symptoms may be nonspecific. Symptoms may present in infancy if there is complete loss of lysosomal acid lipase or in early childhood or adulthood when there is partial loss. The purpose of the present study is to review the literature for pediatric cases of CESD to better understand the phenotype of CESD.
SCD in pregnancy is associated with increased adverse fetal and maternal outcomes. In Tanzania where the frequency of sickle cell trait is 13% there has been scanty data on SCD in pregnancy. With progressive improvement in childhood survival the burden of SCD in pregnancy will increase. We analyzed all deliveries at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) from 1999 to 2011. Fetal and maternal outcomes of SCD deliveries were compared with non-SCD. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics version 19. Chi square and Fisher Exact tests were used to compare proportions and the independent t-test for continuous data. To predict risks of adverse effects, odds ratios were determined using multivariate logistic regression. A p-value<0.05 was considered significant. In total, 157,473 deliveries occurred at MNH during the study period, of which 149 were SCD (incidence of 95 SCD per 100,000 deliveries). The incidence of SCD had increased from 76 per 100,000 deliveries in the 1999-2002 period to over 100 per 100,000 deliveries in recent years. The mean maternal age at delivery was lower in SCD (24.0±5.5 years) than in non-SCD deliveries (26.2±6.0 years), p<0.001. Compared with non-SCD (2.9±0.7 Kg), SCD deliveries had less mean birth-weight (2.6±0.6 Kg), p<0.001. SCD were more likely than non-SCD to deliver low APGAR score at 5 minutes (34.5% Vs 15.0%, OR = 3.0, 95%CI: 2.1-4.2), stillbirths (25.7% Vs 7.5%, OR = 4.0, 95%CI: 2.8-5.8). There was excessive risk of maternal deaths in SCD compared to non-SCD (11.4% Vs 0.4%, OR = 29, 95%CI: 17.3-48.1). The leading cause of deaths in SCD was infections in wholly 82% in contrast to only 32% in non-SCD. In conclusion SCD in pregnancy is an emerging problem at MNH with increased adverse fetal outcomes and excessive maternal mortality mainly due to infections.
PTEN is a tumor-suppressor gene that has been shown to be under the regulatory control of a PTEN pseudogene expressed noncoding RNA, PTENpg1. Here, we characterize a previously unidentified PTENpg1-encoded antisense RNA (asRNA), which regulates PTEN transcription and PTEN mRNA stability. We find two PTENpg1 asRNA isoforms, α and β. The α isoform functions in trans, localizes to the PTEN promoter and epigenetically modulates PTEN transcription by the recruitment of DNA methyltransferase 3a and Enhancer of Zeste. In contrast, the β isoform interacts with PTENpg1 through an RNA-RNA pairing interaction, which affects PTEN protein output through changes of PTENpg1 stability and microRNA sponge activity. Disruption of this asRNA-regulated network induces cell-cycle arrest and sensitizes cells to doxorubicin, which suggests a biological function for the respective PTENpg1 expressed asRNAs.
PIK3CA mutation appears to predict a lack of response to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, the predictive value of PIK3CA mutations for survival remains inconclusive. Here, we pooled the data from published studies to estimate the association between PIK3CA mutation and survival outcomes in mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR mAbs.
PTGS2 genetic 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) miRNA binding sites variants are significantly associated with cancer risk; however, the roles of genetic variants in PTGS2 gene 3'UTR and post-transcriptional regulation have not been elucidated. We report that rs689470 and rs5275 in the PTGS2 3'UTR have potential miRNA-binding sites by using bioinformatics analysis. However, only the rs689470 was significantly associated with PTGS2 mRNA expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines (P = 0.026), but not for rs5275 (P = 0.626). rs689470 might be putative variants mediating the post-transcriptional regulation of target PTGS2 gene. Better understanding of how 3'UTR variants regulate PTGS2 activity will pave the way to targeting the PTGS2 pathway in cancer therapy.
"CYP3A4 is the most important drug metabolizing enzyme in adult humans because of its prominent expression in liver and gut and because of its broad substrate specificity, which includes drugs from most therapeutic categories and many endogenous substances. Expression and function of CYP3A4 vary extensively both intra- and interindividually thus contributing to unpredictable drug response and toxicity. A multitude of environmental, genetic, and physiological factors are known to influence CYP3A4 expression and activity. Among the best predictable sources of variation are drug-drug interactions, which are either caused by pregnane X-receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) mediated gene induction, or by inhibition through coadministered drugs or other chemicals, including also plant and food ingredients. Among physiological and pathophysiological factors are hormonal status, age, and gender, the latter of which was shown to result in higher levels in females compared to males, as well as inflammatory processes that downregulate CYP3A4 transcription. Despite the influence of these non-genetic factors, the genetic influence on CYP3A4 activity was estimated in previous twin studies and using information on repeated drug administration to account for 66% up to 88% of the interindividual variation. Although many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CYP3A locus have been identified, genetic association studies have so far failed to explain a major part of the phenotypic variability. The term ""missing heritability"" has been used to denominate the gap between expected and known genetic contribution, e.g., for complex diseases, and is also used here in analogy. In this review we summarize CYP3A4 pharmacogenetics/genomics from the early inheritance estimations up to the most recent genetic and clinical studies, including new findings about SNPs in CYP3A4 (*22) and other genes (P450 oxidoreductase (POR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA)) with possible contribution to CYP3A4 variable expression."
PTEN is a well-described predisposition gene for Cowden syndrome (CS), a familial cancer syndrome characterized by a high risk of breast and other cancers. KLLN, which shares a bidirectional promoter with PTEN, causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We previously identified germline hypermethylation of the KLLN promoter in 37% of PTEN mutation-negative CS/CS-like (CSL) patients. Patients with germline KLLN hypermethylation have an increased prevalence of breast and renal cancers when compared with PTEN mutation carriers. We have consequently sought to identify and characterize germline KLLN variants/mutations in CS/CSL and in apparently sporadic breast cancer patients. KLLN variants in CS/CSL patients are rare (1 of 136, 0.007%). Interestingly, among 438 breast cancer patients, 13 (3%) have germline KLLN variants when compared with none in 128 controls (P = 0.049). Patients with KLLN variants have a family history of breast cancer when compared with those without (P = 0.02). We demonstrate that germline KLLN variants dysregulate the cell cycle at G2. Of 24 breast carcinomas analyzed, 3 (13%) have somatic KLLN hemizygous deletions, with somatic loss of the wild-type allele in a patient with germline KLLN p.Leu119Leu. Of 452 breast carcinomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas project, 93 (21%) have KLLN hemizygous or homozygous deletions. This is the first study to associate germline KLLN variants with sporadic breast cancer and to recognize somatic KLLN deletions in breast carcinomas. Our observations suggest that KLLN may be a low penetrance susceptibility factor for apparently sporadic breast cancer.
CYP11A1 can hydroxylate vitamin D3 at carbons 17, 20, 22, and 23, producing a range of secosteroids which are biologically active with respect to their ability to inhibit proliferation and stimulate differentiation of various cell types, including cancer cells. As 1α-hydroxylation of the primary metabolite of CYP11A1 action, 20S-hydroxyvitamin D3 [20(OH)D3], greatly influences its properties, we examined the ability of both human and mouse CYP27B1 to 1α-hydroxylate six secosteroids generated by CYP11A1. Based on their kcat/Km values, all CYP11A1-derived metabolites are poor substrates for CYP27B1 from both species compared with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. No hydroxylation of metabolites with a 17α-hydroxyl group was observed. 17α,20-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 acted as an inhibitor on human CYP27B1 but not the mouse enzyme. We also tested CYP27B1 activity on 20,24-, 20,25-, and 20,26-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which are products of CYP24A1 or CYP27A1 activity on 20(OH)D3. All three compounds were metabolized with higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) by both mouse and human CYP27B1 than 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. CYP27B1 action on these new dihydroxy derivatives was confirmed to be 1α-hydroxylation by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. Both 1,20,25- and 1,20,26- trihydroxyvitamin D3 were tested for their ability to inhibit melanoma (SKMEL-188) colony formation, and were significantly more active than 20(OH)D3. This study shows that CYP11A1-derived secosteroids are 1α-hydroxylated by both human and mouse CYP27B1 with low catalytic efficiency, and that the presence of a 17α-hydroxyl group completely blocks 1α-hydroxylation. In contrast, the secondary metabolites produced by subsequent hydroxylation of 20(OH)D3 at C24, C25, or C26 are very good substrates for CYP27B1.
CYP3A4 is the most abundant cytochrome P450 in the human liver. The expression level of CYP3A4 when coexpressed with cytochrome b(5) (cyt b(5)) in Escherichia coli was 20-60% higher than that when it was expressed alone over an extended period (48-72 h). This time-dependent elevation in coexpression with cyt b(5) was a result of an increase in CYP3A4 mRNA half-life; no significant change in CYP3A4 degradation was seen in the bacterial protease fraction. These results suggest that the higher CYP3A4 levels observed upon coexpression with cyt b(5) primarily resulted from CYP3A4 mRNA stabilization by cyt b(5).
CYP1A2 is an important cytochrome P450 enzyme that is involved in the metabolism of many clinical drugs and activation of some precarcinogens. Functional CYP1A2 polymorphisms are considered to exert significant effects on the risk of cancer, but the conclusions are inconsistent. Three commonly studied CYP1A2 polymorphisms, namely rs762551 (A>C), rs2069514 (G>A), and rs3569413 (T>delT), were selected to explore their association with the risk of development of cancer by meta-analysis of published case-control studies. Two investigators independently searched the PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the Chinese Biomedicine Database. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for CYP1A2 polymorphisms and the risk of cancer were calculated in a fixed-effects model (the Mantel-Haenszel method) and a random-effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method) when appropriate. For rs762551, 37 studies were eligible (16 825 cases and 21 513 controls); for rs2069514, 15 studies were eligible (3677 cases and 5127 controls); and for rs3569413, eight studies were eligible (1607 cases and 2043 controls). The results showed that no significant associations with the risk of cancer were found in any model (allele contrast, codominant, dominant, or recessive model) in terms of rs2069514 and rs3569413 when all studies were pooled into a meta-analysis. However, when stratified by cancer type, a statistically significantly elevated risk of cancer was only found in lung cancer for rs3569413 (delT-allele vs. T-allele: OR=1.50, 95% CI=1.16-1.95). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, a significantly increased risk of cancer was found in the Caucasian population for rs3569413 (delT-allele vs. T-allele: OR=1.63, 95% CI=1.01-2.63). With respect to rs762551, we found that carriers of the C-allele showed an increased overall risk of developing cancer compared with A-allele carriers (C-allele vs. A-allele: OR=1.08, 95% CI=1.01-1.16). Further subgroup analyses showed that the rs762551 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of cancer in the subgroup of Caucasians (C-allele vs. A-allele: OR=1.14, 95% CI=1.00-1.28; dominant model: OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.02-1.37). These results suggest that the rs3569413 polymorphism of the CYP1A2 gene is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer and the rs762551 polymorphism of the CYP1A2 gene might be a potential biomarker for the risk of cancer among Caucasians. Further large and well-designed studies are required to confirm this conclusion. 
CYP1A1 plays an essential role in pathogenesis of head and neck cancers. Functional CYP1A1 Ile462Val and MspI single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are considered to have significant effects on risk of head and neck cancers. Several case-control studies have examined how these genetic polymorphisms are involved in development of this group of malignancies, but the conclusions are inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to systematically examine the associations between these functional genetic variants and head and neck cancer risk. A total of 28 studies are eligible for CYP1A1 Ile462Val SNP (4639 patients and 4701 controls), and 22 studies for MspI SNP (4168 patients and 4638 controls). Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were appropriately calculated using either fixed-effect model or random-effect model. There was no association between Ile462Val polymorphism and head and neck cancer risk (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.99-1.53, P = 0.062). However, in a stratified analysis, a statistically significant correlation between this SNP and pharyngeal cancer risk was observed (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.32-2.33, P < 0.001). For MspI SNP, our data indicated that carriers of TC and CC genotypes had a 34% increased risk to develop head and neck cancers compared to TT carriers (95% CI = 1.15-1.57, P < 0.001). This effect was even more pronounced in smokers (OR = 2.98, 95% CI = 1.69-5.26, P < 0.001), demonstrating that gene-smoking interaction intensifying carcinogenesis may exist. These findings reveal that the functional CYP1A1 MspI genetic variant, alone and in combination with smoking, plays a more important role in pathogenesis of head and neck cancers.
CYP2E1 encodes an enzyme which is mainly involved in bioactivation of potential carcinogens such as N-nitrosamines. Polymorphisms in the gene have been reported to be associated with cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate genotype distributions and allele frequencies of five CYP2E1 polymorphisms in Iran.
ABCG2 is a multidrug cellular transport protein that is associated with resistance to certain treatments in patients, particularly anticancer treatment. The tumor-protective properties of ABCG2 expression are reported to be a feature of a subset of stem cell-like tumor cells. While protection against chemotherapy has been well analyzed, the role of ABCG2 in the treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is only partially understood. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently the main treatment option in irresectable renal cell carcinomas. To investigate possible underlying sequence variations in the ABCG2 gene with relevance to the functional properties of the protein, 36 patient samples were analyzed. Using sequence analysis and single-nucleotide polymorphism databases, sequence variations in the highly conserved domains of the binding pocket of ABCG2 were analyzed. The resulting variations were used for computational protein prediction algorithms to identify conformational alterations. A relevant shift from A to G at position 1376 (resulting in Y→C at 459 aa) was identified and found to be present in 8.3% of the patients. These patients are currently in follow-up after resection, thus, further analysis will reveal whether this mutation has relevance to treatment efficacy.
ABCB4 is necessary for the secretion of phospholipids from hepatocytes into bile and for the protection of cell membranes against bile salts. Lipid rafts are plasma membrane microdomains containing high contents of cholesterol and sphingolipids, which are separated by Triton X-100 extraction or OptiPrep gradient centrifugation. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the function of ABCB4 and lipid rafts using mouse canalicular membranes and HEK293 cells stably expressing ABCB4. ABCB4 and ABCB1 were mainly distributed in nonraft membranes. The expression of ABCB4, but not ABCB1, led to significant increases in the phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and sphingomyelin (SM) contents in nonraft membranes and further enrichment of SM and cholesterol in raft membranes. The ABCB4-mediated efflux of PC, PE, and SM was significantly stimulated by taurocholate, while the efflux of PE and SM was much less than that of PC. This ABCB4-mediated efflux was completely abolished by BODIPY-verapamil, which hardly partitioned into raft membranes. In addition, ABCB1 and ABCB4 mediated the efflux of rhodamine 123 and rhodamine 6G from nonraft membranes, which was not affected by taurocholate. We conclude that ABCB4 located in nonrafts, but not in rafts, is predominantly involved in the efflux of phospholipids and other substrates.
 CYP2C19 loss-of-function genotype (*2 and/or *3 alleles) is related to low responsiveness to clopidogrel, which is a risk factor for ischemic cardiac events. The contribution of these genotypes to platelet reactivity in Japanese patients in a steady state receiving dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary stenting was evaluated.
PTEN is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. The role of PTEN in carcinogenesis has been validated by knockout mouse models. PTEN heterozygous mice develop neoplasms in multiple organs. Unfortunately, the embryonic lethality of biallelic excision of PTEN has inhibited the study of complete PTEN deletion in the development and progression of cancer. By crossing PTEN conditional knockout mice with transgenic mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER(T) under the control of a chicken actin promoter, we have generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model that allows temporal control of PTEN deletion. Interestingly, administration of a single dose of tamoxifen resulted in PTEN deletion mainly in epithelial cells, but not in stromal, mesenchymal or hematopoietic cells. Using the mT/mG double-fluorescent Cre reporter mice, we demonstrate that epithelial-specific PTEN excision was caused by differential Cre activity among tissues and cells types. Tamoxifen-induced deletion of PTEN resulted in extremely rapid and consistent formation of endometrial in situ adenocarcinoma, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and thyroid hyperplasia. We also analyzed the role of PTEN ablation in other epithelial cells, such as the tubular cells of the kidney, hepatocytes, colonic epithelial cells or bronchiolar epithelium, but those tissues did not exhibit neoplastic growth. Finally, to validate this model as a tool to assay the efficacy of anti-tumor drugs in PTEN deficiency, we administered the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to mice with induced PTEN deletion. Everolimus dramatically reduced the progression of endometrial proliferations and significantly reduced thyroid hyperplasia. This model could be a valuable tool to study the cell-autonomous mechanisms involved in PTEN-loss-induced carcinogenesis and provides a good platform to study the effect of anti-neoplastic drugs on PTEN-negative tumors.
PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is a serine/threonine kinase in the outer membrane of mitochondria (OMM), and known as a responsible gene of Parkinson's disease (PD). The precursor of PINK1 is synthesized in the cytosol and then imported into the mitochondria via the translocase of the OMM (TOM) complex. However, a large part of PINK1 import mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we examined using cell-free system the mechanism by which PINK1 is targeted to and assembled into mitochondria. Surprisingly, the main component of the import channel, Tom40 was not necessary for PINK1 import. Furthermore, we revealed that the import receptor Tom70 is essential for PINK1 import. In addition, we observed that although PINK1 has predicted mitochondrial targeting signal, it was not processed by the mitochondrial processing peptidase. Thus, our results suggest that PINK1 is imported into mitochondria by a unique pathway that is independent of the TOM core complex but crucially depends on the import receptor Tom70.
PGD for adult-onset conditions is ethically justified when the condition is serious and no safe, effective interventions are available. It is ethically allowed for conditions of lesser severity or penetrance. The Committee strongly recommends that an experienced genetic counselor play a major role in counseling patients considering such procedures.
ABO typing is effective in several forensic investigations, including the identification of unknown cadavers. When the serological method cannot be used because of the decomposition of ABH antigens, ABO genotyping of DNA is often performed. Previously, we reported a novel ABO genotyping method using a DNA chip as a proof of concept. This chip can simultaneously detect single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ABO gene and a part of the primate-specific D17Z1 sequence for human identification. In the present study, this method was modified and further validated for forensic use. We demonstrated that the modified method can correctly perform ABO genotyping and human identification if the appropriate amount of template (>0.5ng of DNA) is analyzed. Moreover, it was found that this chip method can be used to type highly degraded DNA. This method is expected to be a useful supplemental tool for the identification of individuals from highly decomposed samples.
CFTR is the only ABC transporter functioning as a chloride (Cl(-)) channel. We studied molecular determinants, which might distinguish CFTR from standard ABC transporters, and focused on the interface formed by the intracellular loops from the membrane spanning domains.
G6PD deficiency is the most common enzymopathy of red blood cells. The clinical symptoms of favism are jaundice, hematuria and haemolytic anaemia that seem to affect liver and kidney in long term. Thus we evaluate kidney and liver function of favism patients in an endemic area of the disease with a high rate of fava beans cultivation.
CYP2E1 metabolizes ethanol leading to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and acetaldehyde, which are known to cause not only liver damage but also toxicity to other organs. However, the signaling pathways involved in CYP2E1 regulation by ethanol are not clear, especially in extra-hepatic cells. This study was designed to examine the role of CYP2E1 in ethanol-mediated oxidative stress and cytotoxicity, as well as signaling pathways by which ethanol regulates CYP2E1 in extra-hepatic cells. In this study, we used astrocytic and monocytic cell lines, because they are important cells in central nervous system . Our results showed that 100 mM ethanol significantly induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cell death at 24 h in the SVGA astrocytic cell line, which was rescued by a CYP2E1 selective inhibitor, diallyl sulfide (DAS), CYP2E1 siRNA, and antioxidants (vitamins C and E). Further, we showed that DAS and vitamin C abrogated ethanol-mediated (50 mM) induction of CYP2E1 at 6 h, as well as production of ROS at 2 h, suggesting the role of oxidative stress in ethanol-mediated induction of CYP2E1. We then investigated the role of the protein kinase C/c-Jun N-terminal kinase/specificity protein1 (PKC/JNK/SP1) pathway in oxidative stress-mediated CYP2E1 induction. Our results showed that staurosporine, a non-specific inhibitor of PKC, as well as specific PKCζ inhibitor and PKCζ siRNA, abolished ethanol-induced CYP2E1 expression. In addition, inhibitors of JNK (SP600125) and SP1 (mithramycin A) completely abrogated induction of CYP2E1 by ethanol in SVGA astrocytes. Subsequently, we showed that CYP2E1 is also responsible for ethanol-mediated oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death in U937 monocytic cell lines. Finally, our results showed that PKC/JNK/SP1 pathway is also involved in regulation of CYP2E1 in U937 cells. This study has clinical implications with respect to alcohol-associated neuroinflammatory toxicity among alcohol users.
SLC26A4 (PDS) mutations are common cause of congenital hearing loss in East Asia. Hearing loss caused by PDS mutations tends to have delayed presentation; thus universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) can be less effective in these patients. We examined the efficiency of newborn hearing screening test in patients with bi-allelic PDS mutations.
PIK3CA encodes the catalytic subunit of PI3K, p110α. Mutant PIK3CA stimulates the AKT pathway and promotes cancer cell proliferation. PIK3CA mutations have been associated with poor prognosis in patients with colorectal or lung cancer. In contrast, the relationship between PIK3CA mutations and favorable prognoses has been shown in breast cancer. However, the influence of PIK3CA mutations on the prognosis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unclear.
CYP2C8 plays an important role in the metabolism of various drugs, such as paclitaxel, repaglinide and ibuprofen. Polymorphisms in the CYP2C8 gene were shown to influence interindividual differences in the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel, repaglinide and ibuprofen enantiomers. In this study, three CYP2C8 allelic variants (CYP2C8.2, CYP2C8.3 and CYP2C8.4) and wild-type CYP2C8 (CYP2C8.1) were co-expressed for the first time with human cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) and cytochrome b5 by using a baculovirus-assisted insect cell expression system. Further, the effects of genotype-phenotype correlations of CYP2C8 alleles on the metabolism of paclitaxel, repaglinide and ibuprofen enantiomers were evaluated. The CLint values of CYP2C8.2, CYP2C8.3 and CYP2C8.4 for paclitaxel were 47.7%, 64.3% and 30.2% of that of CYP2C8.1 (p<0.01). The CLint values of CYP2C8.2 and CYP2C8.4 for repaglinide were 77.9% and 80.2% of that of CYP2C8.1 (p<0.05), respectively, while the CLint value of CYP2C8.3 was 1.31-fold higher than that of CYP2C8.1 (p<0.05). The relative CLint values of CYP2C8.2, CYP2C8.3 and CYP2C8.4 were 110.5%, 72.3% and 49.7% of that of CYP2C8.1 and were 124.6%, 83.4% and 47.4% of that of CYP2C8.1 for R-ibuprofen and S-ibuprofen, respectively. Comparing hydroxylation by CYP2C8.1 and CYP2C8.3 resulted in higher and lower intrinsic clearance of repaglinide and ibuprofen enantiomers, respectively. These in vitro findings were consistent with the pharmacokinetics in volunteers who were heterozygous or homozygous carriers of CYP2C8*3. The results of this study provide useful information for predicting CYP2C8 phenotypes and may contribute to individualized drug therapy in the future.
UCP2 (uncoupling protein 2) plays an important role in cardiovascular diseases and recent studies have suggested that the A55V polymorphism can cause UCP2 dysfunction. The main aim was to investigate the association of A55V polymorphism with cardiovascular events in a group of 611 patients enrolled in the Medical, Angioplasty or Surgery Study II (MASS II), a randomized trial comparing treatments for patients with coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular function.
CD38 is a multifunctional protein possessing ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity responsible for both the synthesis and the degradation of several Ca(2+)-mobilizing second messengers. In mammals, CD38 also functions as a receptor. In this study CD38 expression in CD4(+), CD8(+), or CD25(+) T cells was significantly higher in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients than in Normal controls. Increased CD38 expression in SLE T cells correlated with plasma levels of Th2 (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13) and Th1 (IL-1β, IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α) cytokines, and was more prevalent in clinically active SLE patients than in Normal controls. In contrast, elevated anti-CD38 IgG autoantibodies were more frequent in clinically quiescent SLE patients (SLEDAI=0) than in Normal controls, and correlated with moderate increased plasma levels of IL-10 and IFN-γ. However, clinically active SLE patients were mainly discriminated from quiescent SLE patients by increased levels of IL-10 and anti-dsDNA antibodies, with odds ratios (ORs) of 3.7 and 4.8, respectively. Increased frequency of anti-CD38 autoantibodies showed an inverse relationship with clinical activity (OR=0.43), and in particular with the frequency of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies (OR=0.21). Increased cell death occurred in CD38(+) Jurkat T cells treated with anti-CD38(+) SLE plasmas, and not in these cells treated with anti-CD38(-) SLE plasmas, or Normal plasmas. This effect did not occur in CD38-negative Jurkat T cells, suggesting that it could be attributed to anti-CD38 autoantibodies. These results support the hypothesis that anti-CD38 IgG autoantibodies or their associated plasma factors may dampen immune activation by affecting the viability of CD38(+) effector T cells and may provide protection from certain clinical SLE features.
CYP2E1 is of paramount toxicological significance because it metabolically activates a large number of low-molecular-weight toxicants and carcinogens. In this context, factors that interfere with Cyp2e1 regulation may critically affect xenobiotic toxicity and carcinogenicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of female steroid hormones in the regulation of CYP2E1, as estrogens and progesterone are the bases of contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy in menopausal women. Interestingly, a fluctuation in the hepatic expression pattern of Cyp2e1 was revealed in the different phases of the estrous cycle of female mice, with higher Cyp2e1 expression at estrus (E) and lower at methestrus (ME), highly correlated with that in plasma gonadal hormone levels. Depletion of sex steroids by ovariectomy repressed Cyp2e1 expression to levels similar to those detected in males and cyclic females at ME. Hormonal supplementation brought Cyp2e1 expression back to levels detected at E. The role of progesterone appeared to be more prominent than that of 17β-estradiol. Progesterone-induced Cyp2e1 upregulation could be attributed to inactivation of the insulin/PI3K/Akt/FOXO1 signaling pathway. Tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen, repressed Cyp2e1 expression potentially via activation of the PI3K/Akt/FOXO1 and GH/STAT5b-linked pathways. The sex steroid hormone-related changes in hepatic Cyp2e1 expression were highly correlated with those observed in Hnf-1α, β-catenin, and Srebp-1c. In conclusion, female steroid hormones are clearly involved in the regulation of CYP2E1, thus affecting the metabolism of a plethora of toxicants and carcinogenic agents, conditions that may trigger several pathologies or exacerbate the outcomes of various pathophysiological states.
CYP1A2 and NADPH-CYP450 oxidoreductase (POR) were expressed in the baculovirus/Spodoptera frugiperda (sf9) system. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of heme precursors on the expression of CYP1A2 and POR.
PLA2G7 gene product is a secreted enzyme whose activity is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). The goal of our study is to investigate the contribution of PLA2G7 promoter DNA methylation to the risk of CHD. Using the bisulphite pyrosequencing technology, PLA2G7 methylation was measured among 36 CHD cases and 36 well-matched controls. Our results indicated that there was a significant association between PLA2G7 methylation and CHD (adjusted P = 0.025). Significant gender-specific correlation was observed between age and PLA2G7 methylation (males: adjusted r = -0.365, adjusted P = 0.037; females: adjusted r = 0.373, adjusted P = 0.035). A breakdown analysis by gender showed that PLA2G7 methylation was significantly associated with CHD in females (adjusted P = 0.003) but not in males. A further two-way ANOVA analysis showed there was a significant interaction between gender and status of CHD for PLA2G7 methylation (gender*CHD: P = 6.04E-7). Moreover, PLA2G7 methylation is associated with the levels of total cholesterols (TC, r = 0.462, P = 0.009), triglyceride (TG, r = 0.414, P = 0.02) and Apolipoprotein B (ApoB, r = 0.396, P = 0.028) in females but not in males (adjusted P>0.4). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed that PLA2G7 methylation could predict the risk of CHD in females (area under curve (AUC) = 0.912, P = 2.40E-5). Our results suggest that PLA2G7 methylation changes with aging in a gender-specific pattern. The correlation between PLA2G7 methylation and CHD risk in females is independent of other parameters including age, smoking, diabetes and hypertension. PLA2G7 methylation might exert its effects on the risk of CHD by regulating the levels of TC, TG, and ApoB in females. The gender disparities in the PLA2G7 methylation may play a role in the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of CHD.
NDUFV1 mutations have been related to encephalopathic phenotypes due to mitochondrial energy metabolism disturbances. In this study, we report two siblings affected by a diffuse leukodystrophy, who carry the NDUFV1 c.1156C>T (p.Arg386Cys) missense mutation and a novel 42-bp deletion. Bioinformatic and molecular analysis indicated that this deletion lead to the synthesis of mRNA molecules carrying a premature stop codon, which might be degraded by the nonsense-mediated decay system. Our results add information on the molecular basis and the phenotypic features of mitochondrial disease caused by NDUFV1 mutations. 
"CD38 (also known as T10) was identified in the late 1970s in the course of pioneering work carried out at the Dana-Farber Cancer Center (Boston, MA) that focused on the identification of surface molecules involved in antigen recognition. CD38 was initially found on thymocytes and T lymphocytes, but today we know that the molecule is found throughout the immune system, although its expression levels vary. Because of this, CD38 was considered an ""activation marker,"" a term still popular in routine flow cytometry. This review summarizes the findings obtained from different approaches, which led to CD38 being re-defined as a multifunctional molecule. CD38 and its homologue CD157 (BST-1), contiguous gene duplicates on human chromosome 4 (4p15), are part of a gene family encoding products that modulate the social life of cells by means of bidirectional signals. Both CD38 and CD157 play dual roles as receptors and ectoenzymes, endowed with complex activities related to signaling and cell homeostasis. The structure-function analysis presented here is intended to give clinical scientists and flow cytometrists a background knowledge of these molecules. The link between CD38/CD157 and human diseases will be explored here in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myeloma and ovarian carcinoma, although other disease associations are also known. Thus CD38 and CD157 have evolved from simple leukocyte activation markers to multifunctional molecules involved in health and disease. Future tasks will be to explore their potential as targets for in vivo therapeutic interventions and as regulators of the immune response."
CYP2C9 enzyme activity is involved in the metabolism of substances related to colorectal cancer (CRC), and it is functionally linked to a genetic polymorphism. Two allelic variants of the CYP2C9 gene, namely CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, differ from wild-type CYP2C9*1 by single amino acid substitutions. These mutated alleles encode enzymes with altered properties that are associated with impaired metabolism. In the past decade, a number of case-control studies have been carried out to investigate the relationship between the CYP2C9 polymorphism and CRC susceptibility, but the results were conflicting. To investigate this inconsistency, we performed a meta-analysis of 13 studies involving a total of 20,879 subjects for CYP2C9*2 and *3 polymorphisms to evaluate the effect of CYP2C9 on genetic susceptibility for CRC. Overall, the summary odds ratio of CRC was 0.94 (95%CI: 0.87-1.03, P = 0.18) and 1.00 (95%CI: 0.86-1.16, P = 0.99) for CYP2C9 *2 and *3 carriers, respectively. No significant results were observed in heterozygous and homozygous when compared with wild genotype for these polymorphisms. In the stratified analyses according to ethnicity, sample size, diagnostic criterion, HWE status and sex, no evidence of any gene-disease association was obtained. Our result suggest that the *2, *3 polymorphisms of CYP2C9 gene are not associated with CRC susceptibility.
DDC (diethyldithiocarbamate) could block collagen synthesis in HSC (hepatic stellate cells) through the inhibition of ROS (reactive oxygen species) derived from hepatocyte CYP2E1 (cytochrome P450 2E1). However, the effect of DDC on MMP-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1), which is the main collagen degrading matrix metalloproteinase, has not been reported. In co-culture experiments, we found that DDC significantly enhanced MMP-1 expression in human HSC (LX-2) that were cultured with hepatocyte C3A cells either expressing or not expressing CYP2E1. The levels of both proenzyme and active MMP-1 enzyme were up-regulated in LX-2 cells, accompanied by elevated enzyme activity of MMP-1 and decreased collagen I, in both LX-2 cells and the culture medium. H2O2 treatment abrogated DDC-induced MMP-1 up-regulation and collagen I decrease, while catalase treatment slightly up-regulated MMP-1 expression. These data suggested that the decrease in ROS by DDC was partially responsible for the MMP-1 up-regulation. ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2), Akt (protein kinase B) and p38 were significantly activated by DDC. The ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) and Akt inhibitor (T3830) abrogated the DDC-induced MMP-1 up-regulation. In addition, a p38 inhibitor (SB203580) improved MMP-1 up-regulation through the stimulation of ERK1/2. Our data indicate that DDC significantly up-regulates the expression of MMP-1 in LX-2 cells which results in greater MMP-1 enzyme activity and decreased collagen I. The enhancement of MMP-1 expression by DDC was associated with H2O2 inhibition and coordinated regulation by the ERK1/2 and Akt pathways. These data provide some new insights into treatment strategies for hepatic fibrosis. 
PTEN loss drives many cancers and recent genetic studies reveal that often PTEN is antagonised at the protein level without alteration of DNA or RNA expression. This scenario can already cause malignancy, because PTEN is haploinsufficient. We here review normally occurring mechanisms of PTEN protein regulation and discuss three processes where PTEN plasticity is needed: ischaemia, development, and wound healing. These situations demand transient PTEN suppression, whereas cancer exploits them for continuous proliferation and survival advantages. Therefore, increased understanding of PTEN plasticity may help us better interpret tumour development and ultimately lead to drug targets for PTEN supporting cancer therapy. 
CYP3A5 is a cytochrome P450 superfamily member which is involved in the metabolism of drugs, steroid hormones, and other xenobiotics. Emerging evidences suggest that CYP3A5*3 (rs776746 A>G) polymorphism may play a role in the etiology of carcinogenesis and affect an individual's susceptibility to cancer in humans, but individually published studies showed inconclusive results. This meta-analysis aimed to derive a more accurate estimation of the correlation between CYP3A5*3 polymorphism and cancer risk. A literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and China BioMedicine databases was conducted on articles published before January 1, 2013. Seventeen case-control studies were included with a total of 7,458 cancer patients and 7,166 healthy controls. The meta-analysis results showed that CYP3A5*3 polymorphism may increase the risk of cancer, especially in acute leukemia, chronic leukemia, and colorectal cancer. However, no statistically significant associations were found in prostate cancer, liver cancer, and other cancers. Further subgroup analysis by ethnicity indicated that CYP3A5*3 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of cancer among Asian and Caucasian populations, but not among African populations. In conclusion, the current meta-analysis suggests that CYP3A5*3 polymorphism may play an important role in the development of acute and chronic leukemia and colorectal cancer, especially among Asian and Caucasian populations. 
SDHD mutations predispose carriers to hereditary paraganglioma syndrome. The objective of this study was to assess the genotype-phenotype correlation of a large Dutch cohort of SDHD mutation carriers and evaluate potential differences in clinical phenotypes due to specific SDHD gene mutations.
NSD1 and EZH2 are SET domain-containing histone methyltransferases that play key roles in the regulation of transcription through histone modification and chromatin modeling: NSD1 preferentially methylates lysine residue 36 of histone 3 (H3K36) and is primarily associated with active transcription, while EZH2 shows specificity for lysine residue 27 (H3K27) and is associated with transcriptional repression. Somatic dysregulation of NSD1 and EZH2 have been associated with tumorigenesis. NSD1, as a fusion transcript with NUP98, plays a key role in leukemogenesis, particularly childhood acute myeloid leukemia. EZH2 is a major proto-oncogene and mono- and biallelic activating and inactivating somatic mutations occur as early events in the development of tumors, particularly poor prognosis hematopoietic malignancies. Constitutional NSD1 and EZH2 mutations cause Sotos and Weaver syndromes respectively, overgrowth syndromes with considerable phenotypic overlap. NSD1 mutations that cause Sotos syndrome are loss-of-function, primarily truncating mutations or missense mutations at key residues in functional domains. EZH2 mutations that cause Weaver syndrome are primarily missense variants and the rare truncating mutations reported to date are in the last exon, suggesting that simple haploinsufficiency is unlikely to be generating the overgrowth phenotype although the exact mechanism has not yet been determined. Many additional questions about the molecular and clinical features of NSD1 and EZH2 remain unanswered. However, studies are underway to address these and, as more cases are ascertained and technology improves, it is hoped that these will, in time, be answered.
PIK3CA mutations occur frequently in breast cancer, predominantly in exons 9 and 20. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the PIK3CA mutation status for its relationship with prognosis and first-line endocrine therapy outcome. PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 were evaluated for mutations in 1,352 primary breast cancer specimens by SnaPshot multiplex analyses. The mutation status was studied for their relationship with metastasis-free survival (MFS) in 342 untreated lymph node-negative (LNN) patients and to time to progression (TTP) in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive patients with metastatic disease treated with first-line tamoxifen (N = 447) or aromatase inhibitors (AIs; N = 84). We detected in 423 patients hotspot mutations for PIK3CA (31 %). Mutations in exon 20 were detected in 251 patients (59 %), with H1047L and H1047R mutations in 37 (15 %) and 214 (85 %) cases, respectively. Mutations in PIK3CA exon 9 were discovered in 173 patients (41 %), with E542K and E545K mutations in 57 (32 %) and 104 (60 %) cases as most prevalent ones. Evaluation of the untreated LNN patients for prognosis showed no relationship between MFS and PIK3CA mutations, neither for exon 9 [HR = 1.04 (95 % CI 0.57-1.89), P = 0.90] nor for exon 20 [HR = 0.98 (95 % CI 0.63-1.54); P = 0.94] when compared to wild-type. The PIK3CA mutation status was also not associated with treatment outcome after first-line tamoxifen. On the other hand, patients treated with first-line AIs showed a longer TTP when having a PIK3CA mutation in exon 9 [HR = 0.40 (95 % CI 0.17-0.95); P = 0.038] or exon 20 [HR = 0.50 (95 % CI 0.27-0.91); P = 0.024] compared to wild-types, both significant in uni- and multivariate analysis including traditional predictive factors. All results remained when only HER2-negative patients were evaluated for each cohort. PIK3CA mutations in ER-positive tumors were significantly associated with a favorable outcome after first-line AIs, which needs further confirmation in other datasets. Mutations were not associated with prognosis in untreated LNN patients nor predictive outcome after first-line tamoxifen therapy in advanced disease patients.
UGT1A1 genotypes are important when considering treatment with irinotecan-containing regimens. In this study, we determined the dose, efficacy, and tolerability of irinotecan according to UGT1A1 genotypes when combined with capecitabine in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
CD36 is a scavenger receptor that exhibits pleiotropic functions, including adhesion to thrombospondin, inhibition of angiogenesis, transport of long-chain fatty acids, and clearance of apoptotic cells. In addition, it has been implicated in the host immune response because it acts as a coreceptor for TLR2 and plays a role in Staphylococcus aureus infection. However, its role in other Gram-positive bacterial infections is unclear. In this study, using mice deficient in CD36, we sought to examine the role of CD36 in pneumococcal pneumonia, a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We show that CD36 is expressed on both alveolar macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells. Early in infection, CD36(-/-) mice have an exaggerated inflammatory response compared with wild-type littermate controls. In vitro studies using CD36(-/-) primary cells confirm the enhanced early inflammation in response to S. pneumoniae and its lipoteichoic acid, demonstrate that S. pneumoniae binds to cells via its phosphocholine residues, and suggest a role for CD36 in reducing inflammation induced by the phosphocholine residues of pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid. Later in infection, although CD36(-/-) mice exhibit impaired bacterial clearance, owing to a decreased capacity of CD36(-/-) macrophages to phagocytose S. pneumoniae, minor effects on mortality occur, in comparison with those in wild-type littermate control mice. These data show that CD36 contributes to the pulmonary host response during S. pneumoniae infection by virtue of its ability to act as a phagocytic receptor and as a modulator of the early innate immune response.
PTEN is a dual-specificity phosphatase and well-known tumor suppressor gene. When functioning properly, it works in its canonical pathway to inhibit AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling, leading to cell death and growth regulation. PTEN mutations cause dysregulation of these pathways, resulting in cellular proliferation and overgrowth. When germline mutations are present as in patients with PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS), benign and malignant neoplasias occur as well as cerebral overgrowth and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. This review article will summarize recent laboratory and clinical investigations relating to PTEN, highlighting the overgrowth aspects of this syndrome and the molecular drivers behind these key phenotypes. Finally, therapies developed targeted the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway for other tumor predisposition syndromes will be discussed.
CYP1A1 is an important xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme, present in liver and kidney. Expression of CYP1A1 enzyme increases manifold when kidney cells are exposed to nephrotoxins/chemicals leading to oxidative stress-induced cell damage. To study the association of CYP1A1 gene polymorphism in patients of chronic kidney disease with unknown etiology (CKDU), we recruited 334 CKDU patients and 334 age and sex matched healthy controls. CYP1A1*2A and *2C polymorphisms were studied by PCR-RFLP and allele specific-PCR respectively. Subjects carrying at least one mutant allele of CYP1A1*2A (TC, CC) and *2C (AG, GG) were shown to be associated with 1.4-2-fold increased risk of CKDU. Also, genotypic combinations of hetero-/homozygous mutants of CYP1A1*2A (TC, CC) with hetero-/homozygous mutant genotypes of CYP1A1*2C (AG, GG) i.e. TC/AG (p<0.01), TC/GG (p<0.05), CC/AG (p<0.05) and CC/GG (p<0.01) were associated with CKDU with an odd ratio ranging 1.8-3.3 times approximately. This study demonstrates association of CYP1A1 polymorphisms with CKDU.
ABO blood group is determined by carbohydrate antigens, called ABH antigens. It has been known that the change of carbohydrate antigen expression, including ABH antigens, has correlation with the tumor metastasis and survival; however, the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. ABH antigens are expressed not only in blood cells but also in several tissues. In epidermis, ABH antigen is expressed in the uppermost spinous and granular layer. We investigated the role of ABH antigens on the cell migration of HaCaT keratinocytes, which express B antigen. Knock-down of B antigen expression by small interference RNA of FUT1 inhibited HaCaT cell migration. At that time, we found that lamellipodia and actin fiber were also reduced by knock-down of B antigen expression. The transcription of cdc42, a kind of Rho GTPase which plays a key role in actin polymerization, was reduced by down-regulated B antigen expression. Furthermore, the reduced B antigen expression also inhibited the interaction of cdc42 and N-WASP. Collectively, our data provide a clue how ABH antigens regulate the cell migration mechanism.
PIK3CA and PTEN mutations are prevalent in colorectal cancer and potential markers of response to mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitors and anti-EGF receptor antibody therapy. Relationships between phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway mutation, clinicopathologic characteristics, molecular features, and prognosis remain controversial.
CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 are enzymes responsible for the metabolism of many centrally acting drugs, toxins and endogenous compounds. Human smokers and alcoholics have elevated levels of CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 in certain brain regions, which may contribute to altered drug efficacy, neurotoxicity and metabolic tolerance. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of ethanol self-administration and nicotine treatment, alone and in combination, on brain CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 levels in monkeys. Monkeys were randomized into four groups (N = 10/group): an ethanol-only group, a nicotine-only group, an ethanol + nicotine group and a control (no drug) group. Ethanol (10% alcohol in sucrose solution) was voluntarily self-administered by the monkeys and nicotine was given as subcutaneous injections (0.5 mg/kg bid). Immunocytochemistry revealed induction of both CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 protein in certain brain regions and cells within monkey brain as a result of ethanol self-administration, nicotine treatment and combined exposure to both drugs. Immunoblotting analyses demonstrated CYP2B6 induction by ethanol in the caudate, putamen and cerebellum (1.5-3.2 fold, P < 0.05), and CYP2E1 induction by nicotine in the frontal cortex and putamen (1.6-2.0 fold, P < 0.05). Combined ethanol and nicotine exposure induced CYP2B6 in the caudate, putamen, thalamus and cerebellum (1.4-2.4 fold, P < 0.05), and CYP2E1 in the frontal cortex and putamen (1.5-1.8, P < 0.05). CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 mRNA levels were unaffected by ethanol or nicotine exposure. In summary, ethanol and nicotine can induce CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 protein in the primate brain, which could potentially result in altered sensitivity to centrally acting drugs and toxins.
SMS text messaging shows promise for delivering smoking cessation support. However, little is known about smokers' feelings towards receiving behavioural advice and support on their mobile phones. This article explores the attitudes of women with experience of prenatal smoking towards receiving pregnancy-related smoking cessation support by text message. Data collected by semi-structured interviews and focus group from women who received either tailored smoking cessation texts or no text support (N = 33) were analysed using thematic analysis. Three themes emerged: convenience, high expectations and perceived source. Texting was regarded as a highly convenient mode of support delivery leading to high levels of attention to messages, although high convenience sometimes resulted in the value of a text being short-lived. Many who did not receive texts had high expectations for text support to intervene with routine smoking behaviour in real time. Those who received texts (with no real-time intervention element), however, felt they were helpful and supportive. Participants discussed how factors relating to perceived source, including personalization, personal relevance and salience of text automatization, could affect message attention and impact. Our findings provide insight into how maximizing personalization and personal relevance can increase the value of text message support and reduce the risk of disengagement.
TAT peptide is one of the best-characterized cell penetrating peptides derived from the transactivator of transcription protein from the human immunodeficiency virus 1. The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between TAT peptide and partially negatively-charged phospholipid bilayer by using lamellar neutron diffraction. The main findings are the existence of a contiguous water channel across the bilayer in the presence of TAT peptide. Taken in combination with other observations, including thinning of the lipid bilayer, this unambiguously locates the peptide within the lipid bilayer. The interaction of TAT peptide with anionic lipid bilayer, composed of an 80:20 mixture of DOPC and DOPS, takes place at two locations. One is in the peripheral aqueous phase between adjacent bilayers and the second is below the glycerol backbone region of bilayer. A membrane thinning above a peptide concentration threshold (1mol%) was found, as was a contiguous transbilayer water channel at the highest peptide concentration (10mol%). This evidence leads to the suggestion that the toroidal pore model might be involved in the transmembrane of TAT peptide. We interpret the surface peptide distribution in the peripheral aqueous phase to be a massive exclusion of TAT peptide from its intrinsic location below the glycerol backbone region of the bilayer, due to the electrostatic attraction between the negatively-charged headgroups of phospholipids and the positively charged TAT peptides. Finally, we propose that the role that negatively-charged headgroups of DOPS lipids play in the transmembrane of TAT peptide is less important than previously thought.
CD36 binds oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). A synthetic peptide comprising amino-acid residues 149-168 of mouse CD36 was recently found to bind fluorescence-labeled oxLDL particles. Based on our oxLDL-binding analysis of various synthetic CD36 peptides, we suggest that not only hydrophilic residues (e.g., Lys164 and Lys166) but also hydrophobic ones (e.g., Phe153, Leu158, and Leu161) are critical to binding.
CYP2J2 epoxygenase is a membrane bound cytochrome P450 that converts omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids into physiologically active epoxides. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparison of the effects of N-terminal modifications on the properties of CYP2J2 with respect to the activity of the protein in model lipid bilayers using Nanodiscs. We demonstrate that the complete truncation of the N-terminus changes the association of this protein with the E.coli membrane but does not disrupt incorporation in the lipid bilayers of Nanodiscs. Notably, the introduction of silent mutations at the N-terminus was used to express full length CYP2J2 in E. coli while maintaining wild-type functionality. We further show that lipid bilayers are essential for the productive use of NADPH for ebastine hydroxylation by CYP2J2. Taken together, it was determined that the presence of the N-terminus is not as critical as the presence of a membrane environment for efficient electron transfer from cytochrome P450 reductase to CYP2J2 for ebastine hydroxylation in Nanodiscs. This suggests that adopting the native-like conformation of CYP2J2 and cytochrome P450 reductase in lipid bilayers is essential for effective use of reducing equivalents from NADPH for ebastine hydroxylation.
ABO discrepancy refers to an inconsistency between red cell and serum typings and has various causes, including hypogammaglobulinemia. IgM deficiency is a rare disorder that may accompany several conditions such as infection and autoimmune disorders. Here, we describe a case of IgM deficiency discovered during the evaluation of an ABO discrepancy in a 16-yr-old Korean boy. ABO blood grouping showed that while his cell type was O+, serum typing detected only anti-A (3+). Anti-B was not detectable at room temperature but was graded at 1+ at 4℃. ABO genotyping revealed an O/O genotype. His serum IgG, IgA, and IgM concentrations were 770 mg/dL (reference range: 800-1,700 mg/dL), 244 mg/dL (reference range: 100-490 mg/dL), and 13.5 mg/dL (reference range: 50-320 mg/dL), respectively. He was diagnosed with acute osteomyelitis on the basis of clinical presentation and imaging studies. The symptoms gradually improved within 3 weeks of treatment. However, the ABO discrepancy and IgM deficiency persisted even 6 months after recovery and lymphocyte subset analysis revealed CD19+ B cell deficiency. To the best of our knowledge, IgM deficiency detected by ABO discrepancy in a patient with acute osteomyelitis has not been reported before.
CFTR is an integral transmembrane glycoprotein and a cAMP-activated Cl(-) channel. Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to Cystic Fibrosis (CF)-an autosomal recessive disease with majority of the morbidity and mortality resulting from airway infection, inflammation, and fibrosis. The most common disease-associated mutation in the CFTR gene-deletion of Phe508 (ΔF508) leads to a biosynthetic processing defect of CFTR. Correction of the defect and delivery of ΔF508-CFTR to the cell surface has been highly anticipated as a disease modifying therapy. Compared to promising results in cultured cell this approach was much less effective in CF patients in an early clinical trial. Although the cause of failure to rescue ΔF508-CFTR in the clinical trial has not been determined, presence of factor(s) that interfere with the rescue in vivo could be considered. The cytokine TGF-β1 is frequently elevated in CF patients. TGF-β1 has pleiotropic effects in different disease models and genetic backgrounds and little is known about TGF-β1 effects on CFTR in human airway epithelial cells. Moreover, there are no published studies examining TGF-β1 effects on the functional rescue of ΔF508-CFTR. Here we found that TGF-β1 inhibits CFTR biogenesis by reducing mRNA levels and protein abundance in primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells from non-CF individuals. TGF-β1 inhibits CFTR biogenesis without compromising the epithelial phenotype or integrity of HBE cells. TGF-β1 also inhibits biogenesis and impairs the functional rescue of ΔF508-CFTR in HBE cells from patients homozygous for the ΔF508 mutation. Our data indicate that activation of TGF-β1 signaling may inhibit CFTR function in non-CF individuals and may interfere with therapies directed at correcting the processing defect of ΔF508-CFTR in CF patients.
PIK3CA gene mutations have been detected in many malignancies, but the frequency of different mutations and their role in the carcinogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the clinical pathological impact and prognostic implications of PIK3CA mutations in lung adenocarcinoma.
ABO blood group system is the most important blood group in transfusion and has been widely used in population studies. Several molecular techniques for ABO allele's detection are widely used for distinguishing various alleles of glycosyl transferase locus on chromosome 9.
UCP2 is a mitochondrial membrane transporter expressed in white adipose tissue and involved in regulation of energy balance. In this present study, we examined the depot specific comparison of UCP2 gene expression in different metabolic states, in order to explore the potential role of UCP2 in human obesity and diabetes. We also determined UCP2's association with adiponectin and insulin resistance with different parameters of the metabolic syndrome.
STS are uncommon tumors of the connective tissues. The OS of patients with advanced sarcomas has improved in the last 20 years, but remains under 2 years. Drug discovery for this disease has been complicated by the fact that there are many different subtypes that comprise STS. In fact, emerging data suggest that each of these subtypes may represent a different entity, with a unique molecular profile and responsiveness to therapy. Testing of new agents and determining predictors for response in this heterogeneous disease is therefore of utmost importance.
PTEN loss is considered a biomarker for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, a pathway frequently mutated in cancer, and was recently shown to confer resistance to dietary restriction. Here, we show that Pten loss is not sufficient to drive AKT activation and resistance to dietary restriction in tumors with low growth factor receptor levels. We describe a murine Pten-null Kras-driven lung cancer model that harbors both dietary restriction-resistant, higher-grade, bronchiolar tumors with high AKT activity, and dietary restriction-sensitive, lower-grade, alveolar tumors with low AKT activity. We find that this phenotype is cell autonomous and that normal bronchiolar cells express higher levels of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 5 (ENTPD5), an endoplasmic reticulum enzyme known to modulate growth factor receptor levels. Suppression of ENTPD5 is sufficient to decrease IGF-IR levels and sensitize bronchiolar tumor cells to serum in vitro and to dietary restriction in vivo. Furthermore, we find that a significant percentage of human non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) have low AKT activity despite PTEN loss. 
GLA is the causative gene of Fabry disease, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder resulting from α-galactosidase A (α-GAL) deficiency. Stroke is an important manifestation of Fabry disease, and recent epidemiological studies have indicated that up to 4.9% of young male cryptogenic stroke patients have GLA mutations. To determine the importance of GLA mutations in the general stroke population, the frequency of GLA mutations in Japanese male ischaemic stroke (IS) patients with various risk factors and ages was measured.
PTEN plays an important role not only in tumorigenesis but also in the normal development of central nervous system. PTEN loss in neural progenitor cells during embryogenesis disrupts migration and proper formation of the brain laminar structure. We generated a conditional PTEN knockout mouse by crossing mice that express Cre recombinase driven by the human GFAP promoter to a floxed PTEN gene to investigate the role of astroglial PTEN signaling pathway in neuronal patterning and lamination. We found PTEN loss not only in astroglial cells, but also in radial glia-derived neurons in hGFAP-Cre(+/-)/PTEN(loxp/loxp) transgenic mice. Homozygous hGFAP-Cre(+/-)/PTEN(loxp/loxp) transgenic mice showed progressive brain enlargement with cellular disorganization that occurred predominantly in hippocampus and cerebellum and died by postnatal day 20. Confocal images show that nestin-positive radial glial cells were observed in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum at postnatal day 0 in homozygous hGFAP-Cre(+/-)/PTEN(loxp/loxp), but not in heterozygous hGFAP-Cre(+/-)/PTEN(loxp/-) and hGFAP-Cre(-/-)/PTEN(loxp/loxp) mice. Homozygous hGFAP-Cre(+/-)/PTEN(loxp/loxp) transgenic mouse eyes, which lack radial glial lineage, were able to develop normal architectonics after birth. In addition, we also found that neuronal progenitor migration was defected at postnatal day 0 in homozygous hGFAP-Cre(+/-)/PTEN(loxp/loxp) mice. These results suggest that PTEN has a critical role in regulating radial glial differentiation, proliferation, maturation, and eventually neuronal patterning in central nervous system in a spatio-temporal dependent manner.
CYP3A4 is a major drug-metabolizing enzyme in humans, whose expression levels show large inter-individual variations and are associated with several factors such as genetic polymorphism, physiological and disease status, diet and xenobiotic exposure. Nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a key transcription factor for the xenobiotic-mediated transcription of CYP3A4. In this study, we have investigated a possible involvement of liver X receptor α (LXRα), a critical regulator of cholesterol homeostasis, in the hepatic CYP3A4 expression since several recent reports suggest the involvement of CYP3A enzymes in the cholesterol metabolism in humans and mice. Reporter assays using wild-type and mutated CYP3A4 luciferase reporter plasmids and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that LXRα up-regulated CYP3A4 through the known DNA elements critical for the PXR-dependent CYP3A4 transcription, suggesting LXRα as a positive regulator for the CYP3A4 expression and a crosstalk between PXR and LXRα in the expression. In fact, reporter assays showed that LXRα activation attenuated the PXR-dependent CYP3A4 transcription. Moreover, a PXR agonist treatment-dependent increase in CYP3A4 mRNA levels was suppressed by co-treatment with an LXRα agonist in human primary hepatocytes and HepaRG cells. The suppression was not observed when LXRα expression was knocked-down in HepaRG cells. In conclusion, the present results suggest that sterol-sensitive LXRα positively regulates the basal expression of CYP3A4 but suppresses the xenobiotic/PXR-dependent CYP3A4 expression in human hepatocytes. Therefore, nutritional, physiological and disease conditions affecting LXRα might be one of the determinants for the basal and xenobiotic-responsive expression of CYP3A4 in human livers. 
SLC26A11 (human)/Slc26a11 (mouse), also known as kidney brain anion transporter (KBAT), is a member of the SLC26 anion transporter family and shows abundant mRNA expression in the brain. However, its exact cellular distribution and subcellular localization in the brain and its functional identity and possible physiological roles remain unknown. Expression and immunostaining studies demonstrated that Slc26a11 is abundantly expressed in the cerebellum, with a predominant expression in Purkinje cells. Lower expression levels were detected in hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, and subcortical structures. Patch clamp studies in HEK293 cells transfected with mouse cDNA demonstrated that Slc26a11 can function as a chloride channel that is active under basal conditions and is not regulated by calcium, forskolin, or co-expression with cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator. Single and double immunofluorescent labeling studies demonstrated the localization of vacuolar (V) H⁺-ATPase and Slc26a11 (KBAT) in the plasma membrane in Purkinje cells. Functional studies in HEK293 cells indicated that transfection with Slc26a11 stimulated acid transport via endogenous V H⁺-ATPase. We conclude that Slc26a11 (KBAT) is prominently distributed in output neurons of various subcortical and cortical structures in the central nervous system, with specific expression in Purkinje cells and that it may operate as a chloride channel regulating acid translocation by H⁺-ATPase across the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments.
CYP1A1 gene belongs to the cytochrome P450 family and is known better as smokers' gene due to its hyperactivation as a consequence of long term smoking. The expression of CYP1A1 induces polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon production in the lungs, which when over expressed, is known to cause smoking related diseases, such as cardiovascular pathologies, cancer, and diabetes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the simplest form of genetic variations that occur at a higher frequency, and are denoted as synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs on the basis of their effects on the amino acids. This study adopts a systematic in silico approach to predict the deleterious SNPs that are associated with disease conditions. It is inferred that four SNPs are highly deleterious, among which the SNP with rs17861094 is commonly predicted to be harmful by all tools. Hydrophobic (isoleucine) to hydrophilic (serine) amino acid variation was observed in the candidate gene. Hence, this investigation aims to characterize a candidate gene from 159 SNPs of CYP1A1. 
ABCG2 impacts oral availability, tissue distribution and excretion of its substrates, including anticancer and anti-infectious drugs. Highly expressed at physiological barriers, its secretion level significantly controls drug distribution. Furthermore, its increased content into many types of cancer may lead to cell chemoresistance. Owing to the clinical relevance of ABCG2 in the multidrug resistance phenomenon, ABCG2 constitutes an appealing therapeutic target to increase drug distribution. Development of ABCG2 inhibitors can be used in combination with anticancer drugs to block the drug secretion from cancer cells. Very recently, an alternative use of ABCG2 inhibitors in enhancing the bioavailability of ABCG2 substrates has emerged. Hence, it is important to investigate ABCG2 inhibitors with high selectivity, high potency and safety. New inhibitors discovered during the last 5 years will be presented and discussed.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is a dual-specificity lipid and protein phosphatase. The loss of PTEN was originally discovered in numerous human cancers. PTEN inhibition by bisperoxovanadium (bpV) reduces neurological damage after ischemic brain injury. The purpose of this study was to identify the optimal neuroprotective dose of bpV when administrated after focal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. Focal I/R injury was induced using the middle cerebral artery occlusion method. bpV at doses of 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0 mg/kg were injected intraperitoneally just after reperfusion, with saline serving as a vehicle control. A maximal reduction in brain injury was observed with 1.0 mg/kg bpV. This dose of bpV also significantly blocked apoptosis in the penumbral cortex of rats. This beneficial effect was associated with the increasing levels of Akt phosphorylation in the penumbral cortex. These results demonstrate that the pharmacological inhibition of PTEN protects against I/R injury in a dose-dependent manner and the protective effect might be induced through upregulation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt pro-survival pathway, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy to combat ischemic brain injury.
AKR1B1 of the polyol pathway was identified as a prostaglandin F2α synthase (PGFS). Using a genomic approach we have identified in the endometrium five bovine and three human AKRs with putative PGFS activity and generated the corresponding recombinant enzymes. The PGFS activity of the recombinant proteins was evaluated using a novel assay based on in situ generation of the precursor of PG biosynthesis PGH2. PGF2α was measured by ELISA and the relative potencies of the different enzymes were compared. We identified AKR1A1 and confirmed AKR1B1 as the most potent PGFS expressing characteristic inhibition patterns in presence of methylglyoxal, ponalrestat and glucose. 
CFTR is a PKA activated Cl(-) channel expressed in the apical membrane of fluid transporting epithelia. We previously demonstrated that c-Cbl decreases CFTR stability in the plasma membrane by facilitating its endocytosis and lysosomal degradation in human airway epithelium. The most common mutation associated with cystic fibrosis, deletion of Phe508 (∆F508), leads to a temperature sensitive biosynthetic processing defect in the CFTR protein. Mature ∆F508-CFTR that has been rescued by low temperature or chemical chaperones is partially functional as a Cl(-) channel but has decreased plasma membrane stability due to altered post-maturational trafficking. Our present data demonstrate that c-Cbl controls the post-maturational trafficking of rescued ∆F508-CFTR. Partial depletion of c-Cbl increased stability of the plasma membrane associated mature ∆F508-CFTR and the ∆F508-CFTR mediated Cl(-) secretion. These data indicate that correcting the post-maturational trafficking of ∆F508-CFTR may represent a therapeutic approach complementary to the biosynthetic rescue. Because c-Cbl functions as an adaptor and scaffolding protein during CFTR endocytosis, we propose that interfering with the c-Cbl mediated endocytic recruitment of ∆F508-CFTR may increase stability of ∆508-CFTR in the plasma membrane after its biosynthetic rescue.
CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) have similar substrate specificities and work together to form an intestinal absorption barrier against xenobiotics. Previous reports have indicated that CYP3A4 expression decreases gradually, whereas P-gp expression increases, from the upper to lower small intestine. The physiological rationale for this uneven distribution of CYP3A4 and P-gp as a barrier against xenobiotics has not been determined. To clarify the effect of these distribution patterns on barrier function, we constructed a mathematical model that included passive membrane permeation, P-gp-mediated apical efflux, and CYP3A4-mediated metabolism, and we simulated the effects of these distribution patterns on the fraction absorbed of co-substrates without changing their overall activities. The simulation showed that the physiological distribution patterns of both CYP3A4 and P-gp result in the lowest fraction absorbed, but not for drugs with low CYP3A4 and high P-gp-mediated clearances. These results suggest that the distribution pattern of CYP3A4 is especially important for the barrier function. On the other hand, physiological distribution pattern of P-gp exerts the maximum barrier function for dual good substrates for P-gp and CYP3A4, but even distribution of P-gp mostly suppresses the intestinal absorption of good P-gp, but poor CYP3A4 substrates.
SUCLA2 is one of several nuclear-encoded genes that can cause encephalomyopathy accompanied by mitochondrial DNA depletion. The disorder usually manifests in early childhood and leads to early death. The gene encodes one of the subunits of succinyl-CoA synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of substrates succinyl-CoA and ADP to products succinate and ATP in the tricarboxylic acid pathway. Thirty-two individuals harboring mutations in SUCLA2 have so far been reported, and five different mutations were observed among these individuals. Here we report identification of a novel mutation in SUCLA2 in two cousins affected with encephalomyopathy. The novel mutation causes p.Asp251Asn; the affected amino acid is likely positioned within the ATP-grasp domain of the encoded protein. As previously reported in other patients, we did not observe elevation of methylmalonic acid, the biochemical hallmark of patients with mutations in SUCLA2. We instead found elevated levels of succinylcarnitine. 
  CYP2D6 polymorphisms show large geographical and interethnic differences. Variations in CYP2D6 activity may impact upon a patient's pain level and may contribute to interindividual variations in the response to opioids. This paper reviews the evidence on how CYP2D6 polymorphisms might influence pain sensitivity and clinical response to codeine and tramadol. For example, it is shown that (1) CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs) may be less efficient at synthesizing endogenous morphine compared with other metabolizers. In contrast, ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs) may be more efficient than other metabolizers at synthesizing endogenous morphine, thus strengthening endogenous pain modulation. Additionally, for codeine and tramadol that are bioactivated by CYP2D6, PMs may undergo no metabolite formation, leading to inadequate analgesia. Conversely, UMs may experience quicker analgesic effects but be prone to higher mu-opioid-related toxicity. The literature suggested the potential usefulness of the determination of CYP2D6 polymorphisms in elucidating serious adverse events and in preventing subsequent inappropriate selection or doses of codeine and tramadol. Notably, even though many studies investigated a possible role of the CYP2D6 polymorphisms on pain sensitivity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these drugs, the results of analgesia and adverse effects are conflicting. More studies are required to demonstrate genetically determined unresponsiveness and risk of developing serious adverse events for patients with pain and these should involve larger numbers of patients in different population types. 
ABCC11 genotype affects apocrine secretory cell function and determines individual body odor phenotype. Rodriguez et al. have applied genetic epidemiology using predetermined phenotype data to demonstrate an association between a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs17822931) and the human behavior of deodorant application. Individuals with the ABCC11 genotype predicting a nonodorous phenotype report a significantly lower frequency of deodorant use.
GSTM1 (glutathione S-transferase mu 1) and GSTT1 (glutathione S-transferase theta 1) are critical enzymes for detoxification of endogenous and environmental carcinogens. Constitutive GST gene polymorphisms may be associated with increased risk for cancer development. We made an explorative study of a Brazilian population with malignant glioma to determine whether GSTM1 and GSTT1 genetic polymorphisms influence the response to intranasal administration of perillyl alcohol and the survival rate. Patients were stratified into groups according to clinical presentation, tumor classification, and tumor location. Circulating DNA was extracted from blood plasma or serum, and genotypes were detected by multiplex PCR. The cohort included 95 patients with recurrent malignant glioma included in a Phase I/II clinical trial with perillyl alcohol and 100 matched healthy control subjects. GSTM1 frequency was similar in patients with glioma (44%) and healthy controls (54%), but GSTT1 deletion was found in 11.5% patients, contrasting with 36% in controls. A longer survival rate was associated with a lack of GSTM1 deletion (31 weeks) and a deletion for GSTT1 (28 weeks). A poor survival rate was associated with GSTM1 deletion (23 weeks) and with a lack of a GSTT1 deletion (19 weeks). A significantly lower frequency of GSTT1 deletion in glioma patients compared to healthy controls indicates that GSTT1 deletion may exert a protective role against gliomagenesis, influence therapeutic response to intranasal perillyl alcohol treatment, and increase overall survival, especially considering tumor topography.
SLC35A3 is considered the main UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter (NGT) in mammals. Detailed analysis of NGT is restricted because mammalian mutant cells defective in this activity have not been isolated. Therefore, using the siRNA approach, we developed and characterized several NGT-deficient mammalian cell lines. CHO, CHO-Lec8, and HeLa cells deficient in NGT activity displayed a decrease in the amount of highly branched tri- and tetraantennary N-glycans, whereas monoantennary and diantennary ones remained unchanged or even were accumulated. Silencing the expression of NGT in Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in the keratan sulfate content, whereas no changes in biosynthesis of heparan sulfate were observed. We also demonstrated for the first time close proximity between NGT and mannosyl (α-1,6-)-glycoprotein β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Mgat5) in the Golgi membrane. We conclude that NGT may be important for the biosynthesis of highly branched, multiantennary complex N-glycans and keratan sulfate. We hypothesize that NGT may specifically supply β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase 7 (β3GnT7), Mgat5, and possibly mannosyl (α-1,3-)-glycoprotein β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Mgat4) with UDP-GlcNAc. 
PIK3CA is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers. PIK3CA is phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha. It controls cell growth, proliferation, motility, survival, differentiation and intracellular trafficking. In most of human cancer alteration occurred frequently in the alpha isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase. PIK3CA mutations were most frequent in endometrial, ovarian, colorectal, breast, cervical, squamous cell cancer of the head and neck, chondroma, thyroid carcinoma and in cancer family syndrome. Inhibition of PI3K signaling can diminish cell proliferation, and in some circumstances, promote cell death. Consequently, components of this pathway present attractive targets for cancer therapeutics. A number of PI3K pathway inhibitors have been developed and used. PI3K inhibitors (both pan-PI3K and isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors), dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors that are catalytic site inhibitors of the p110 isoforms and mTOR (the kinase component of both mTORC1 and mTORC2), mTOR catalytic site inhibitors, and AKT inhibitors are the most advanced in the clinic. They are approved for the treatment of several carcinomas. 
AQP4 (aquaporin-4), a water channel protein that is predominantly expressed in astrocyte end-feet, plays an important role in the brain oedema formation, and is thereby considered to be a potential therapeutic target. Using a stopped-flow analysis, we showed that propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol), a general anaesthetic drug, profoundly inhibited the osmotic water permeability of AQP4 proteoliposomes in the presence of Zn²⁺. This propofol inhibition was not observed in AQP1, suggesting the specificity for AQP4. In addition, the inhibitory effects of propofol could be reversed by the removal of Zn²⁺. Other lipid membrane fluidizers also similarly inhibited AQP4, suggesting that the modulation of protein-lipid interactions plays an essential role in the propofol-induced inhibition of AQP4. Accordingly, we used Blue native PAGE and showed that the profound inhibition caused by propofol in the presence of Zn²⁺ is coupled with the reversible clustering of AQP4 tetramers. Site-directed mutagenesis identified that Cys²⁵³, located at the membrane interface connecting to the C-terminal tail, is responsible for Zn²⁺-mediated propofol inhibition. Overall, we discovered that propofol specifically and reversibly inhibits AQP4 through the interaction between Zn²⁺ and Cys²⁵³. The findings provide new insight into the functional regulation of AQP4 and may facilitate the identification of novel AQP4-specific inhibitors.
PTEN is an important gene whose protein product is double specific phosphatase holding key regulatory functions in sending signals from membrane receptors for growth factors into the cell downstreams. Its participation, mainly by PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the pathomechanism of many malignant cancers was unambiguously confirmed. The PTEN function gets disturbed on many levels and for various reasons. Disorders of PTEN protein expression seem to be even more common in many carcinomas. The aim of the study is to enquire the meaning of PTEN expression in the cancer transformation process in large intestine glandular polyps.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated and/or deleted in many types of tumor. This gene also plays a very distinct role in the early stages of embryonic development such as cell migration, proliferation and migration. Nevertheless, little is known of the function of PTEN in vasculogenesis during chick embryonic development. In this study, we used in situ hybridization to first demonstrate the expression pattern of PTEN during gastrulation. PTEN was found mainly expressed in the blood islands of area opaca, the neural tube and mesodermal structures. Overexpression of PTEN obstructed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in the primitive streak. EMT is the first prerequisite required for the emigration of hemangioblasts during vasculogenesis. When PTEN expression was silenced, we observed that it produced an adverse effect on mesodermal cell emigration to the extra-embryonic blood islands. In addition, we also demonstrated that even if the perturbed-PTEN cells did not affect the formation of blood islands, migrant mesodermal cells overexpressing wt PTEN-GFP had difficulties integrating into the blood islands. Instead, these cells were either localized on the periphery of the blood islands or induced to differentiate into endothelial cells if they managed to integrate into blood islands. Development of the intra-embryonic primary vascular plexus was also affected by overexpression of PTEN. We proposed that it was elevated PTEN lipid phosphatase activity that was responsible for the morphogenetic defects induced by PTEN overexpression. In this context, we did not find PTEN affecting VEGF signaling. In sum, our study has provided evidence that PTEN is involved in vasculogenesis during the early stages of chick embryo development. 
ABCG2 is an important multidrug transporter involved also in urate transport, thus its mutations can lead to the development of gout and may also alter general drug absorption, distribution and excretion. The frequent ABCG2 polymorphism, Q141K, is associated with an elevated risk of gout and has been controversially reported to reduce the plasma membrane expression and/or the transport function of the protein. In the present work we examined the stability and cellular processing of the Q141K ABCG2 variant, as well as that of the ΔF142 ABCG2, corresponding to the ΔF508 mutation in the CFTR (ABCC7) protein, causing cystic fibrosis. The processing and localization of full length ABCG2 variants were investigated in mammalian cells, followed by Western blotting and confocal microscopy, respectively. Folding and stability were examined by limited proteolysis of Sf9 insect cell membranes expressing these ABCG2 constructs. Stability of isolated nucleotide binding domains, expressed in and purified from bacteria, was studied by CD spectroscopy. We find that the Q141K variant has a mild processing defect which can be rescued by low temperature, a slightly reduced activity, and a mild folding defect, especially affecting the NBD. In contrast, the ΔF142 mutant has major processing and folding defects, and no ATPase function. We suggest that although these mutations are both localized within the NBD, based on molecular modeling their contribution to the ABCG2 structure and function is different, thus rescue strategies may be devised accordingly. 
G6PD catalyzes the first, pace-making reaction of pentosephosphate cycle (PPC) which produces NADPH. NADPH maintains glutathione and thiol groups of proteins and enzymes in the reduced state which is essential for protection against oxidative stress. Individuals affected by G6PD deficiency are unable to regenerate reduced glutathione (GSH) and are undefended against oxidative stress. G6PD deficiency accelerates normal senescence and enhances the precocious removal of chronologically young, yet biologically old cells. The term hemolytic anemia is misleading because RBCs do not lyse but are removed by phagocytosis. Acute hemolysis by fava bean ingestion in G6PD deficient individuals (favism) is described being the best-studied natural model of oxidant damage. It bears strong analogies to hemolysis by oxidant drugs or chemicals. Membrane alterations observed in vivo during favism are superimposable to changes in senescent RBCs. In summary, RBC membranes isolated from favic patients contained elevated amounts of complexes between IgG and the complement fragment C3b/C3c and were prone to vesiculation. Anti-band 3 IgG reacted to aggregated band 3-complement complexes. In favism extensive clustering of band 3 and membrane deposition of hemichromes were also observed. Severely damaged RBCs isolated from early crises had extensive membrane cross-bonding and very low GSH levels and were phagocytosed 10-fold more intensely compared to normal RBCs.
CYP3A4 is the main isoform of cytochrome P450 oxidases involved in the metabolism of approximately 60 % drugs, and its expression level is highly variable in human subjects. CYP3A4 is regulated by many transcription factors, among which the pregnane X receptor/steroid and xenobiotic receptor (PXR/SXR, NR1I2) have been identified as the most critical. Genetic polymorphisms (such as SNPs) in PXR may affect the expression level of CYP3A4. Although numerous SNPs have been identified in PXR and have appeared to affect PXR function, their impact on the expression of CYP3A4 in human subjects has not been well studied. Thus, a clinical study in healthy Chinese subjects was conducted to investigate the impact of PXR polymorphisms on repaglinide (an endogenous marker for CYP3A4 activity) pharmacokinetics used alone or in combination with a PXR inducer, flucloxacillin.
CYP2E1 plays a critical role in detoxification and carcinogenic activation of drugs, pollutants, and dietary compounds; however, these metabolic processes can involve poorly characterized cooperative interactions that compromise the ability to understand and predict CYP2E1 metabolism. Herein, we employed an array of ten azoles with an emphasis on pyrazoles to establish the selectivity of catalytic and cooperative CYP2E1 sites through binding and catalytic studies. Spectral binding studies for monocyclic azoles suggested two binding events, while bicyclic azoles suggested one. Pyrazole had moderate affinity toward the CYP2E1 catalytic site that improved when a methyl group was introduced at either position 3 or 4. The presence of methyl groups simultaneously at positions 3 and 5 blocked binding, and a phenyl group at position 3 did not improve binding affinity. In contrast, pyrazole fusion to a benzene or cyclohexane ring greatly increased affinity. The consequences of these binding events on CYP2E1 catalysis were studied through inhibition studies with 4-nitrophenol, a substrate known to bind both sites. Most pyrazoles shared a common mixed cooperative inhibition mechanism in which pyrazole binding rescued CYP2E1 from substrate inhibition. Overall, inhibitor affinities toward the CYP2E1 catalytic site were similar to those reported in binding studies, and the same trend was observed for binding at the cooperative site. Taken together, these studies identified key structural determinants in the affinity and stoichiometry of azole interactions with CYP2E1 and consequences on catalysis that further advance an understanding of the relationship between structure and function for this enzyme.
PIK3CA (phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide) mutations can help predict the antitumor activity of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway inhibitors in both preclinical and clinical settings. In light of the recent discovery of tumor-initiating cancer stem cells (CSCs) in various tumor types, we developed an in vitro CSC model from xenograft tumors established in mice from a colorectal cancer patient tumor in which the CD133+/EpCAM+ population represented tumor-initiating cells. CD133+/EpCAM+ CSCs were enriched under stem cell culture conditions and formed 3-dimensional tumor spheroids. Tumor spheroid cells exhibited CSC properties, including the capability for differentiation and self-renewal, higher tumorigenic potential and chemo-resistance. Genetic analysis using an OncoCarta™ panel revealed a PIK3CA (H1047R) mutation in these cells. Using a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, PF-04691502, we then showed that blockage of the PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibited the in vitro proliferation of CSCs and in vivo xenograft tumor growth with manageable toxicity. Tumor growth inhibition in mice was accompanied by a significant reduction of phosphorylated Akt (pAKT) (S473), a well-established surrogate biomarker of PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway inhibition. Collectively, our data suggest that PF-04691502 exhibits potent anticancer activity in colorectal cancer by targeting both PIK3CA (H1047R) mutant CSCs and their derivatives. These results may assist in the clinical development of PF-04691502 for the treatment of a subpopulation of colorectal cancer patients with poor outcomes.
SDS and sodium deoxycholate (SDC) as two representative detergents have been widely used in LC-MS/MS-based shotgun analysis of membrane proteomes. However, some inherent disadvantages limit their applications such as interference with MS analysis or their weak ability to disrupt membranes. To address this, the combinative application of SDS and SDC was developed and evaluated in our study, which comprehensively used the strong ability of SDS to lyse membranes and solubilize hydrophobic membrane proteins, and the high efficiencies of an optimized acetone precipitation method and SDC in sample clean-up, protein recovery, and redissolution and digestion of precipitated proteins. The comparative study using a rat-liver-membrane-enriched sample showed that, compared with other three commonly used methods including the filter-aided sample preparation strategy, the combinative method not only increased the identified number of total proteins, membrane proteins, and integral membrane proteins by an average of 19.8, 23.9, and 24.8%, respectively, but also led to the identification of the highest number of matching peptides. All these results demonstrate that the method yielded better recovery and reliability in the identification of the proteins especially highly hydrophobic integral membrane proteins than the other three methods, and thereby has more potential in shotgun membrane proteomics. 
ABCG2 is a member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily and identified to play an important role in multidrug resistance in many studies. But the expression of ABCG2 is controversial in many kinds of tumors including colorectal cancer (CRC).
PTEN is thought to play a critical role in T cell activation by negatively regulating the PI3K signaling pathway important for cellular activation, growth, and proliferation. To directly eliminate PTEN in postthymic T cells for studies of functional effects, we used CAR transgenic × PTEN(flox/flox) mice, which enabled gene deletion using a Cre adenovirus in vitro. These mice were also immunized to generate stable Th1 clones that could have PTEN deleted when desired. PTEN-deleted T cells exhibited enhanced IL-2 production, proliferation, and Akt phosphorylation upon TCR/CD28 engagement, whereas T cell survival was not potentiated. Gene expression profiling revealed a small subset of induced genes that were augmented upon PTEN deletion. However, PTEN-deficient T cells still required CD28 costimulation for IL-2 production and remained susceptible to anti-CD3-induced anergy. The absence of PTEN within the CD8 T cell compartment led to markedly increased cytolytic activity following an allogeneic MLR in vitro, without increasing autologous MLR activity. Our results indicate that deletion of PTEN can augment the activation of postthymic T cells but does not mediate CD28 independence or anergy resistance. Nonetheless, PTEN inhibition may be a viable target for immune potentiation owing to increased cytokine production by activated CD4(+) cells and increased cytotoxicity by CD8(+) T cells. 
CD36 is a fatty acid translocase in striated muscle cells and cardiomyocytes. Some study suggested that alterations in CD36 gene may be associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. The aim of the current study was to compare the frequency of CD36 variants in region encoding lipid-binding domain in Caucasian patients with early-onset CAD, no-CAD adult controls and neonates. The study group comprised 100 patients with early onset CAD. The genetic control groups were 306 infants and 40 no-CAD adults aged over 70years. Exons 4, 5 and 6 including fragments of flanking introns were studied using the denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography technique and direct sequencing. Changes detected in analyzed fragment of CD36: IVS3-6 T/C (rs3173798), IVS4-10 G/A (rs3211892), C311T (Thr104Ile, not described so far) in exon 5, G550A (Asp184Asn, rs138897347), C572T (Pro191Leu, rs143150225), G573A (Pro191Pro, rs5956) and A591T (Thr197Thr, rs141680676) in exon 6. No significant differences in the CD36 genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies were found between the three groups. Only borderline differences (p=0.066) were found between early onset CAD patients and newborns in the frequencies of 591T allele (2.00% vs 0.50%) and CGCGCGT haplotype (2.00% vs 0.50%) with both IVS3-6C and 591T variant alleles. In conclusion, CD36 variants: rs3173798, rs3211892, rs138897347, rs5956, rs143150225 rs141680676 and C311T do not seem to be involved in the risk of early-onset CAD in Caucasian population.
ABCG2 (also known as breast cancer resistance protein) is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter localized to the plasma membrane where it mediates the efflux of xenobiotics, including potential therapeutics. Studies investigating Abcg2 function at the blood-brain barrier in mouse models are often compared with human ABCG2 function. It is critical to understand the nature of species differences between mouse and human ABCG2, since extrapolations are made from murine data to humans. Two independent drug-selected cell line pairs expressing human or mouse ABCG2 were compared for efflux of fluorescent substrates using flow cytometry. To this end, we developed and characterized a new mouse Abcg2-expressing subline that demonstrated efflux of known fluorescent ABCG2 substrates and increased resistance to mitoxantrone, which is reduced in the presence of the ABCG2 inhibitor Ko143. Our results indicate that the substrate specificity of human and mouse ABCG2 is very similar. We identified a new human and mouse ABCG2 substrate, a porphyrin analog, purpurin-18 (Pp-18), which is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein or multidrug resistance protein 1. The ability of inhibitors to block efflux activity of ABCG2 was assessed using Pp-18. Inhibitors also demonstrated similar effects on human and mouse ABCG2. Chrysin, benzoflavone, and cyclosporin A inhibited Pp-18 efflux in both human and mouse ABCG2. The similarity of the substrate and inhibitor specificity of human and mouse ABCG2 supports interpretation of mouse models in understanding the clinical, pharmacological, and physiologic roles of ABCG2. 
PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) comprises a collection of genetic disorders associated with germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN. Therapeutic options and preventative measures for PHTS are limited. Using both genetically engineered mouse models and pharmacological PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors, we found that the roles of PI3K isoforms are spatially distinct in the skin: While p110α is responsible for the sustained survival of suprabasal cells of the epidermis in the absence of PTEN, p110β is important for the hyperproliferation of basal cells in PHTS. Furthermore, we identified a differential expression pattern of p110α and p110β in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes as well as differential PI3K regulation by upstream signals in the basal and suprabasal compartments of the epidermis, providing a potential molecular mechanism underlying the specific roles of PI3K isoforms in the epidermis. Finally, we demonstrate that combined inhibition of both PI3K isoforms prevents the development of PHTS and also reverses skin hamartomas that have reached advanced stages in mice. Together, these results not only advance our overall understanding of the diverse roles of PI3K isoforms, but also have the potential for meaningful translation via the clinical utilization of PI3K inhibitors for both prevention and therapy in PHTS patients. 
CYP2C19 belongs to the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes involved in activating and detoxifying many carcinogens and endogenous compounds, which has attracted considerable attention as a candidate gene for digestive system cancer. CYP2C19 has two main point mutation sites (CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3) leading to poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype. In the past decade, the relationship between CYP2C19 polymorphism and digestive system cancer has been reported in various ethnic groups; however, these studies have yielded contradictory results.
SLC17A1 protein (NPT1) was the first identified member of the SLC17 phosphate transporter family, and is known to mediate Na(+)/inorganic phosphate (Pi) co-transport when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Although this protein was suggested to be a renal polyspecific anion exporter, its transport properties were not well characterized. The clean biochemical approach revealed that proteoliposomes comprising purified NPT1 as the only protein source transport various organic anions such as urate, p-aminohippuric acid (PAH), and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) in a membrane potential (Δψ)-driven and Cl(-) -dependent manner. Human NPT1 carrying an SNP mutation, Thr269Ile, known to increase the risk of gout, exhibited 32% lower urate transport activity compared to the wild type protein, leading to the conclusion that NPT1 is the long searched for transporter responsible for renal urate excretion. In the present article, we summarized the history of identification of the urate exporter and its possible involvement in the dynamism of urate under physiological and pathological conditions. 
ACE inhibitors are the leading cause of drug-induced angio-oedema in the USA. ACE inhibitor-induced intestinal angio-oedema, a much rarer complication of this medication, has been reported. The author reports a patient presenting with a 1-day history of severe abdominal pain. The patient was started on lisinopril 2 days prior to this presentation. Computer axial tomography (CAT) scan of the abdomen demonstrated extensive and marked thickening, and oedema involving the duodenum and proximal jejunum associated with significant mesenteric oedema. Concerns for visceral angio-oedema and a possible association with lisinopril according to the Naranjo algorithm were raised. Lisinopril was discontinued and the patient was treated with antihistamines. The patient improved clinically in the next 24 h and discharged home with education and documentation of this serious allergy. ACE inhibitor-induced visceral angio-oedema is under-reported and most often missed resulting in waste of hospital resources towards working up this clinical diagnosis. 
CYP2C8 is an important member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes; it affects the activity of various drugs used in routine clinical practice, including amiodarone, chloroquine, amodiaquine, and repaglinide, as well as endogenous compounds, such as arachidonic acid and retonic acid. It is also the main enzyme involved in the metabolism of the widely used anticancer drug Paclitaxel, which has a very narrow therapeutic index. There is evidence that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CYP2C8 gene influence the adverse reactions and/or the efficacy of drugs metabolized by this enzyme. We examined the allele and genotype frequencies of widely studied functional polymorphisms of the CYP2C8 gene in a North Indian population. We assayed the genomic DNA of at least 251 healthy unrelated North Indians for CYP2C8*2, CYP2C8*3 (G416A, A1196G), and CYP2C8*4 genetic polymorphisms by RFLP technique. These results were compared to information on other populations. The allelic frequencies of CYP2C8*2, CYP2C8*3, and CYP2C8*4 were found to be 3, 4, and 4% respectively. The two CYP2C8*3 polymorphisms (G416A and A1196G) were found to be completely linked to each other. Allele frequencies of CYP2C8 genetic variants in northern Indians were found to have a distinct pattern that differs from that of southern Indian and other global populations. This is the first report from North India on CYP2C8 polymorphisms. Ethnic differences with respect to polymorphisms are the molecular basis of interethnic variability in pharmacokinetics. Our study may help in rational use of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C8 in this population. 
ACE2 alternatively converts angiotensin (Ang) II into Ang-(1-7) and Ang I into Ang-(1-9). There is little information in the literature with respect to Ang-(1-9) properties. A number of studies show a link between peptides of the renin-angiotensin system and thrombosis.
FIG4 is a phosphatase that regulates intracellular vesicle trafficking along the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. Mutations of FIG4 lead to the development of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, ALS-associated proteins (transactivation response DNA protein 43 (TDP-43), fused in sarcoma (FUS), optineurin, ubiquilin-2, charged mutivesicular body protein 2b (CHMP2B) and valosin-containing protein) are involved in inclusion body formation in several neurodegenerative diseases. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the brains and spinal cords of patients with various neurodegenerative diseases, including sporadic TDP-43 proteinopathy (ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration). TDP-43 proteinopathy demonstrated no FIG4 immunoreactivity in neuronal inclusions. However, FIG4 immunoreactivity was present in Pick bodies in Pick's disease, Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, neuronal nuclear inclusions in polyglutamine and intranuclear inclusion body diseases, and Marinesco and Hirano bodies in aged control subjects. These findings suggest that FIG4 is not incorporated in TDP-43 inclusions and that it may have a common role in the formation or degradation of neuronal cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions in several neurodegenerative diseases.
CYP19A1 gene product aromatase (CYP19A1) is a 58-kDa protein and belongs to the member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which facilitates the bioconversion of estrogens from androgens. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP19A1 affect the activity of the enzyme and have been implicated in the association of estrogen-dependent disease, prognosis, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity of third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Based on ethnicity, the frequency distribution of CYP19A1 alleles will differ, and until now, no data are available for Indians. Using qRT-PCR with TaqMan assays, the frequencies of functionally important polymorphic variants of CYP19A1 gene were determined in 163 healthy subjects of South Indian origin. The observed frequencies of the CYP19A1 minor alleles for the SNPs rs4646 (T), rs10046 (T), rs700519 (T), rs700518 (G), rs727479 (G), rs4775936 (T), rs10459592 (G), rs749292 (A), rs6493497 (T), and rs7176005 (A) are 41.1 (35.8-46.4), 20.0 (15.6-24.3), 33.7 (28.6-38.9), 17.8 (13.6-21.9), 25.8 (21.0-30.5), 19.9 (15.6-24.3), 33.7 (28.6-38.9), 24.9 (20.2-29.5), 35.9 (30.7-41.1), and 35.9 (30.7-41.1), respectively. Strong linkage disequilibrium existed between CYP19A1 SNPs, and sixteen different haplotype structures with a frequency >1% were derived from all the 10 SNPs tested. The most common being the haplotype (H1) GCTATCTGTG with a frequency of about 17.8%. Gender-specific assessment showed significant difference in the allele frequency for rs749292 (p < 0.04), and greater inter-ethnic variation was detected in the distribution of CYP19A1 variants except for rs727479. Our results could provide preliminary insight for further pharmacogenetic investigations of AIs as well as for subsequent molecular epidemiological studies on the contribution of these variants to the occurrence and development of estrogen-dependent disease in South Indians.
CYP2D6 is responsible for the oxidative metabolism of 20-25 % of clinical drugs and its genetic polymorphisms can significantly influence the drug metabolism. In this study, we analyzed the functional activities of four nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms from CYP2D6*52 allele, which were recently found, and one found frequently in CYP2D6 alleles. Recombinant variant enzymes of E418K, S486T, and R296C were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. However, a CYP holoenzyme spectrum of P34S variant was not detected in E. coli whole cell level. Structural analysis indicated that P34S mutation seemed to perturb a highly conserved proline-rich N-terminus of CYP2D6. Steady state kinetic analyses showed the significant reductions of enzymatic activities in E418K and R296C variants. In the case of bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation, a novel mutant, E418K, showed 32 % decrease in catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) mainly due to the decrease of k cat value. R296C showed much greater reduction in the catalytic efficiency (9 % of wild-type) due to both of a decrease of k cat value and an increase of K m value. In the case of dextromethorphan O-demethylation, E418K showed both of a decrease of k cat value and an increase K m value to result in ~43 % reduction of catalytic efficiency. A highly decreased catalytic efficiency (~6 % of wild-type) in the mutant of R296C also was observed mainly due to the dramatic change of k cat value of dextromethorphan O-demethylation. These results suggested that individuals carrying these allelic variants are likely to have the altered metabolic abilities of many clinical drugs therefore, these polymorphisms of CYP2D6 should be much concerned for reliable drug treatment. 
ABCG2 is an ATP-binding cassette transporter protein which has a role in the regulation of endogenous protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) levels.
ABCB1 encodes the multi-drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and has been implicated in multi-drug resistance. We comprehensively evaluated this gene and flanking regions for an association with clinical outcome in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).
SLC5A8 is a putative tumor suppressor that is inactivated in more than 10 different types of cancer, but neither the oncogenic signaling responsible for SLC5A8 inactivation nor the functional relevance of SLC5A8 loss to tumor growth has been elucidated. Here, we identify oncogenic HRAS (HRAS(G12V)) as a potent mediator of SLC5A8 silencing in human nontransformed normal mammary epithelial cell lines and in mouse mammary tumors through DNMT1. Further, we demonstrate that loss of Slc5a8 increases cancer-initiating stem cell formation and promotes mammary tumorigenesis and lung metastasis in an HRAS-driven murine model of mammary tumors. Mammary-gland-specific overexpression of Slc5a8 (mouse mammary tumor virus-Slc5a8 transgenic mice), as well as induction of endogenous Slc5a8 in mice with inhibitors of DNA methylation, protects against HRAS-driven mammary tumors. Collectively, our results provide the tumor-suppressive role of SLC5A8 and identify the oncogenic HRAS as a mediator of tumor-associated silencing of this tumor suppressor in mammary glands. These findings suggest that pharmacological approaches to reactivate SLC5A8 expression in tumor cells have potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment. 
ABCC8 encodes the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunits of the beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel playing a critical role in the regulation of insulin secretion, and inactivating mutations in ABCC8 cause congenital hyperinsulinism. Recently, ABCC8 inactivating mutations were reported to be involved in the development of diabetes mellitus later in life. We report a girl who was born macrosomic with transient hypoglycemia and thereafter developed diabetes mellitus accompanied by severe reactive hypoglycemia at the age of 11 yr. An OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) revealed hyperglycemia due to poor early insulin response and subsequent hypoglycemia due to delayed prolonged insulin secretion. Hypoglycemia was improved by the combination of nateglinide, which stimulates early insulin secretion, and an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, voglibose. Sequencing of the ABCC8 identified a compound heterozygous mutation (R1420H/F591fs604X), suggesting that this mutation may alter regulation of insulin secretion with advancing age, leading to diabetes mellitus with reactive hypoglycemia from hyperinsulinism. Therefore, long-term follow-up and periodic OGTTs are important for early detection of insulin dysregulation in congenital hyperinsulinism patients carrying the ABCC8 mutation, even though hypoglycemia resolves spontaneously during infancy. Furthermore, nateglinide may be useful therapeutically in the treatment of not only diabetes mellitus but also reactive hypoglycemia. 
ABO iso-immunization is the most frequent haemolytic disease of the newborn. Treatment depends on the total serum bilirubin level, which may increase very rapidly in the first 48 hours of life in cases of haemolytic disease of the newborn. Phototherapy and, in severe cases, exchange transfusion are used to prevent hyperbilirubinaemic encephalopathy. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) are used to reduce exchange transfusion. Herein, we present a female newborn who was admitted to the NICU because of ABO immune haemolytic disease. After two courses of 1 g/kg of IVIG infusion, she developed necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Administration of IVIG to newborns with significant hyperbilirubinaemia due to ABO haemolytic disease should be cautiously administered and followed for complications. 
IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) is a potential biomarker and drug target. Genomic and epigenetic data on astrocytoma have demonstrated that the IDH1 mutation is sufficient to establish the glioma hypermethylator phenotype. Furthermore, recent studies have also indicated that a mutant IDH1 inhibitor induced demethylation of histone H3K9me3 and expression of genes associated with gliogenic differentiation. As the presence of the p.R132H mutation in the IDH1 gene seems to be a more powerful prognostic marker than O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter status, we evaluated the presence of IDH1 mutation in Polish patients with astrocytoma, glioblastoma, oligoastrocytoma, ganglioglioma, oligodendroglioma, and ependymoma.
SOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2) is one of the endogenous antioxidant enzymes that protect against reactive oxygen species. While explorations of SOD2 expression regulation are mainly focused on transcriptional and post-translational activation, there are few reports about the post-transcriptional regulation of SOD2. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21nt-25nt (nucleotide) small noncoding RNAs that have emerged as indispensable regulators of gene expression. Here we show that miR-146a, a widely expressed miRNA, is up-regulated by H2O2-induced stress. By sequence analysis we found a binding site for miR-146a in the sod2 mRNA 3'UTR, and a luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-146a can interact with this sod2 regulatory region. Our results further show that miR-146a could down-regulate the SOD2 protein expression, and antisense-miR-146a could reverse the decrease of both the SOD2 level and cell viability in H2O2 treated PC12 cells. In conclusion, here we have identified a novel function of miR-146a in the post-transcriptional regulation of SOD2 expression. 
PTEN is a potent tumor-suppressor protein. Aggressive and metastatic prostate cancer (PC) is associated with a reduction or loss of PTEN expression. PTEN reduction often occurs without gene mutations, and its downregulation is not fully understood. Herein, we show that PTEN is incorporated in the cargo of exosomes derived from cancer cells. PTEN is not detected in exosomes derived from normal, noncancerous cells. We found that PTEN can be transferred to other cells through exosomes. In cells that have a reduction or complete loss of PTEN expression, the transferred PTEN is competent to confer tumor-suppression activity to acceptor cells. In PC patients, we show that PTEN is incorporated in the cargo of exosomes that circulate in their blood. Interestingly, normal subjects have no PTEN expression in their blood exosomes. Further, we found that the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is incorporated in PC patients' and normal subjects' blood exosomes. These data suggest that exosomal PTEN can compensate for PTEN loss in PTEN deficient cells, and may have diagnostic value for prostate cancer. 
"CYP2A6 metabolizes nicotine to its primary metabolite cotinine and also mediates the metabolism of cotinine to trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (3HC). The ratio of 3HC to cotinine (the ""nicotine metabolite ratio"", NMR) is an in vivo marker for the rate of CYP2A6 mediated nicotine metabolism, and total nicotine clearance, and has been associated with differences in numerous smoking behaviors. The clearance of 3HC, which affects the NMR, occurs via renal excretion and metabolism by UGT2B17, and possibly UGT2B10, to 3HC-glucuronide. We investigated whether slower 3HC glucuronidation alters NMR, altering its ability to predict CYP2A6 activity and reducing its clinical utility."
CYP3A4 is a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of numerous compounds, such as paclitaxel, and its activity shows an extensive inter-individual variation which can influence treatment response. The study's purpose was to investigate the potential predictive role of a CYP3A4 profile (CYP3A4*1B, rs2740574 and CYP3A4*22, rs35599367) in serous ovarian cancer patients treated with first-line chemotherapy (paclitaxel and cisplatin or carboplatin), after cytoreductive surgery. CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A4*22 genotypes were determined by Nested PCR-RFLP and Taqman® Allelic Discrimination, respectively. We observed that the mean survival rates were statistically different according the patients CYP3A4 genotypes. The group of patients carrying the CYP3A4*1B G allele present a decreased mean survival rate when compared with AA genotype patients (103.93 and 134.44 months, respectively, p = 0.010). This result is consistent after multivariate Cox regression analysis (HR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.03-4.52; p = 0.043). The combination of CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A4*22 polymorphisms result in the definition of a CYP3A4 activity profile: the group of patients with a higher CYP3A4 activity profile had significantly diminished survival when compared with patients with a lower CYP3A4 activity profile (101.06 and 134.44 months, respectively, p = 0.012). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed a diminished overall survival time for patients with CYP3A4 high activity profile (HR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.05-5.02; p = 0.038). The definition of a CYP3A4 activity profile resulted in the increase of prediction ability, using Harrels's concordance indexes (C-index from 0.617 to 0.626). To conclude, our results demonstrate an association between CYP3A4*1B and a diminished overall survival of patients with serous ovarian cancer. The definition of a CYP3A4 activity profile proved to be benefic and the CYP3A4 high activity profile was associated with a lower overall survival. We consider that the definition of a CYP3A4 activity profile might be useful as molecular marker for predicting the clinical outcome of serous ovarian cancer patients. 
NMNAT2 is an NAD(+)-synthesizing enzyme with an essential axon maintenance role in primary culture neurons. We have generated an Nmnat2 gene trap mouse to examine the role of NMNAT2 in vivo. Homozygotes die perinatally with a severe peripheral nerve/axon defect and truncated axons in the optic nerve and other CNS regions. The cause appears to be limited axon extension, rather than dying-back degeneration of existing axons, which was previously proposed for the NMNAT2-deficient Blad mutant mouse. Neurite outgrowth in both PNS and CNS neuronal cultures consistently stalls at 1-2 mm, similar to the length of truncated axons in the embryos. Crucially, this suggests an essential role for NMNAT2 during axon growth. In addition, we show that the Wallerian degeneration slow protein (Wld(S)), a more stable, aberrant NMNAT that can substitute the axon maintenance function of NMNAT2 in primary cultures, can also correct developmental defects associated with NMNAT2 deficiency. This is dose-dependent, with extension of life span to at least 3 months by homozygous levels of Wld(S) the most obvious manifestation. Finally, we propose that endogenous mechanisms also compensate for otherwise limiting levels of NMNAT2. This could explain our finding that conditional silencing of a single Nmnat2 allele triggers substantial degeneration of established neurites, whereas similar, or greater, reduction of NMNAT2 in constitutively depleted neurons is compatible with normal axon growth and survival. A requirement for NMNAT2 for both axon growth and maintenance suggests that reduced levels could impair axon regeneration as well as axon survival in aging and disease. 
CD36 (also known as GPIV) deficiency is known to be responsible for the production of anti-Nak(a) antibodies in different clinical settings such as fetal/neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT), platelet transfusion refractoriness (PTR) and post-transfusion purpura (PTP). However, no data regarding the relevance of CD36 immunisation is currently available for China. In this study, healthy blood donors were typed for CD36 deficiency using flow cytometry. Nucleotide sequencing was performed to identify the molecular basis underlying the CD36 deficiency. Anti-Nak(a) antibodies in CD36-deficient individuals were analysed by ELISA and flow cytometry. By analysis of 998 healthy blood donors, 18 individuals failed to express CD36 on their platelets. In 5/12 individuals no CD36 expression was detected both on platelets and monocytes. This result suggested that the frequencies of type I CD36 deficiency (platelets and monocytes) and type II CD36 deficiency (platelets only) are approximately 0.5 and 1.3%, respectively. Nucleotide sequencing analysis of type I CD36 deficient individuals revealed eight different mutations; four of them were not described so far. However, 1228-1239del ATTGTGCCTATT and 329-330delAC appear to be the most common mutations related to type I CD36 deficiency in South Chinese population. Further analysis showed that 1/5 type I CD36 deficient individuals developed anti-Nak(a) antibodies. In addition, anti-Nak(a) antibodies could be identified in two cases of thrombocytopenia associated with FNAIT and PTR. In conclusion, more than 0.5% of CD36 type I-deficient individuals are at risk to be immunised through blood transfusion or pregnancy in China. Testing of anti-Nak(a) antibodies should be considered in FNAIT and PTR suspected cases. A registry of CD36-deficient donors should be established to allow treatment of immune-mediated bleeding disorders caused by anti-Nak(a) antibodies.
PDE10A is a recently identified phosphodiesterase with a quite remarkable localization since the protein is abundant only in brain tissue. Based on this unique localization, research has focused extensively on using PDE10A modulators as a novel therapeutic approach for dysfunction in the basal ganglia circuit including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, schizophrenia, addiction and obsessive compulsive disorder. Medicinal chemistry efforts identified the N-methyl-N-[4-(quinolin-2-ylmethoxy)-phenyl]-isonicotinamide (8) as a nanomolar PDE10A inhibitor. A subsequent Lead-optimization program identified analogous N-methylanilides and their corresponding N-methylbenzamides (29) as potent PDE10A inhibitors, concurrently some interesting and unexpected binding modes were identified. 
"CLC anion transporters form dimers that function either as Cl(-) channels or as electrogenic Cl(-)/H(+) exchangers. CLC channels display two different types of ""gates,"" ""protopore"" gates that open and close the two pores of a CLC dimer independently of each other and common gates that act on both pores simultaneously. ClC-7/Ostm1 is a lysosomal 2Cl(-)/1H(+) exchanger that is slowly activated by depolarization. This gating process is drastically accelerated by many CLCN7 mutations underlying human osteopetrosis. Making use of some of these mutants, we now investigate whether slow voltage activation of plasma membrane-targeted ClC-7/Ostm1 involves protopore or common gates. Voltage activation of wild-type ClC-7 subunits was accelerated by co-expressing an excess of ClC-7 subunits carrying an accelerating mutation together with a point mutation rendering these subunits transport-deficient. Conversely, voltage activation of a fast ClC-7 mutant could be slowed by co-expressing an excess of a transport-deficient mutant. These effects did not depend on whether the accelerating mutation localized to the transmembrane part or to cytoplasmic cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domains of ClC-7. Combining accelerating mutations in the same subunit did not speed up gating further. No currents were observed when ClC-7 was truncated after the last intramembrane helix. Currents and slow gating were restored when the C terminus was co-expressed by itself or fused to the C terminus of the β-subunit Ostm1. We conclude that common gating underlies the slow voltage activation of ClC-7. It depends on the CBS domain-containing C terminus that does not require covalent binding to the membrane domain of ClC-7. "
ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may have anti-tumor properties. We investigated whether the use of ACEI/ARBs affects the clinical outcomes of primary breast cancer patients receiving taxane and anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
ABCG2 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transporters, the overexpression of which has been implicated in resistance to various chemotherapeutic agents. Though a number of cell-based assays to screen for inhibitors have been reported, they do not provide a content-rich platform to discriminate toxic and autofluorescent compounds. To fill this gap, we developed a live high-content cell-based assay to identify inhibitors of ABCG2-mediated transport and, at the same time, assess their cytotoxic effect and potential optical interference. We used a pair of isogenic U87MG human glioblastoma cell lines, with one stably overexpressing the ABCG2 transporter. JC-1 (J-aggregate-forming lipophilic cation 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazol carbocyanine iodide) was selected as the optimal reporter substrate for ABCG2 activity, and the resulting assay was characterized by a Z' value of 0.50 and a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 14 in a pilot screen of ∼ 7,000 diverse chemicals. The screen led to the identification of 64 unique nontoxic positives, yielding an initial hit rate of 1%, with 58 of them being confirmed activity. In addition, treatment with two selected confirmed positives suppressed the side population of U87MG-ABCG2 cells that was able to efflux the Hoechst dye as measured by flow cytometry, confirming that they constitute potent new ABCG2 transporter inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that our live cell and content-rich platform enables the rapid identification and profiling of ABCG2 modulators, and this new strategy opens the door to the discovery of compounds targeting the expression and/or trafficking of ABC transporters as an alternative to functional inhibitors that failed in the clinic.
ABCG2 is a member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transmembrane proteins that plays an important role in stem cell biology and drug resistance of cancer cells. In this study, we investigated how expression of human ABCG2 gene is regulated in lung cancer A549 cells. Binding of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors to the ABCG2 promoter in vitro and in vivo was elucidated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The ABCG2 promoter activity was impaired when Sp1 sites were mutated but was enhanced by overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 proteins. Knockdown of Sp1 or Sp3 expression by short interfering RNA significantly decreased the expression of ABCG2 mRNA and protein, resulting in attenuated formation of the side population in A549 cells. In addition, Sp1 inhibition in vivo by mithramycin A suppressed the percentage of the side population fraction and sphere forming activities of A549 cells. Moreover, inhibiting Sp1- or Sp3-dependent ABCG2 expression caused chemosensitization to the anticancer drug cisplatin. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors are the primary determinants for activating basal transcription of the ABCG2 gene and play an important role in maintaining the side population phenotype of lung cancer cells. 
CD36 is a scavenger receptor involved in lipid uptake and inflammation. Recently, non-cell-bound CD36 (sCD36) was identified in plasma and suggested to be a marker of lipid accumulation in the vessel wall. Marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may have cardioprotective effects. This study evaluated the effect of marine n-3 PUFA on sCD36 levels in overweight subjects. Fifty overweight subjects were randomized to 1.1 g of n-3 PUFA or 2 g of olive oil daily for six weeks. Neutrophils were isolated at baseline and after six weeks of treatment while an adipose tissue biopsy was obtained at baseline. The content of n-3 PUFA in adipose tissue and neutrophils was analyzed by gas chromatography, while plasma levels of sCD36 were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After six weeks of supplement plasma sCD36 did not differ between supplements (P = 0.18). There was no significant correlation between plasma sCD36 levels and n-3 PUFA in neutrophils at baseline (r = -0.02, P = 0.88), after six weeks supplement (r = -0.03, P = 0.85) or in adipose tissue (r = 0.14, P = 0.34). This study therefore does not provide evidence for a cardioprotective effect of n-3 PUFA acting through a CD36-dependent mechanism. 
GNE myopathy is a clinicopathologically distinct distal myopathy with autosomal-recessive inheritance. The GNE gene mutations are known to cause this form of distal myopathy
CYP2C19 is involved in the metabolism of clinically relevant drugs, including the antiplatelet prodrug clopidogrel, which has prompted interest in clinical CYP2C19 genotyping. The CYP2C19∗4B allele is defined by both gain-of-function [c.-806C>T (∗17)] and loss-of-function [c.1A>G (∗4)] variants on the same haplotype; however, current genotyping and sequencing assays are unable to determine the phase of these variants. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop an assay that could rapidly detect and discriminate the related ∗4A, ∗4B, and ∗17 alleles. An allele-specific PCR assay, composed of four unique primer mixes that specifically interrogate the defining ∗17 and ∗4 variants, was developed by using samples (n = 20) with known genotypes, including the ∗4A, ∗4B, and/or ∗17 alleles. The assay was validated by testing 135 blinded samples, and the results were correlated with CYP2C19 genotyping and allele-specific cloning/sequencing. Importantly, among the six ∗4 carriers in the validation cohort, after allele-specific PCR testing both samples with a ∗1/∗4 genotype were reclassified to ∗1/∗4A, all three samples with a ∗4/∗17 genotype were reclassified to ∗1/∗4B, and a sample with a ∗4/∗17/∗17 genotype was reclassified to ∗4B/∗17. In conclusion, this rapid and robust allele-specific PCR assay can refine CYP2C19 genotyping and metabolizer phenotype classification by determining the phase of the defining ∗17 and ∗4 variants, which may have utility when testing CYP2C19 for clopidogrel response. 
LOXL2 is a copper- and lysine tyrosylquinone-dependent amine oxidase that has been proposed to function both extracellularly and intracellularly to activate oncogenic signaling pathways leading to EMT and invasion of breast cancer cells. In this study, we selected MCF-7 cells that stably express forms of recombinant LOXL2 differing in their subcellular localizations and catalytic competencies. This enabled us to dissect the molecular functions of intracellular and extracellular LOXL2s and examine their contributions to breast cancer metastasis/invasion. We discovered that secreted LOXL2 (~100-kDa) is N-glycosylated at Asn-455 and Asn-644, whereas intracellular LOXL2 (~75-kDa) is nonglycosylated and N-terminally processed, and is primarily associated with the nucleus. Both forms of LOXL2 can oxidize lysine in solution. However, we found that expression of intracellular LOXL2 is more strongly associated with EMT and invasiveness than secreted LOXL2 in vitro. The results indicate that nuclear associated LOXL2 contributes to the stabilization of Snail1 transcription factor at the protein level to induce EMT and promote invasion in vitro, through repression of E-cadherin, occludin, and estrogen receptor-α, and up-regulation of vimentin, fibronectin, and MT1-MMP.
CYP2C19 encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, which play a central role in activating and detoxifying many carcinogens and endogenous compounds thought to be involved in the development of cancer. In the past decade, two common polymorphisms among CYP2C19 (CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3) that are responsible for the poor metabolizers (PMs) phenotype in humans and cancer susceptibility have been investigated extensively; however, these studies have yielded contradictory results.
NQO1 [NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1; also known as DT-diaphorase] is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyses the two-electron reduction of various quinones including vitamin K. The enzyme may play a role in vitamin K metabolism by reducing vitamin K to vitamin K hydroquinone for utilization in the post-translational γ-glutamyl carboxylation reactions required by several proteins involved in blood coagulation. The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of NQO1 to vitamin K reduction and haemostasis in an in vivo model. We examined the contribution of NQO1 to haemostasis by examining survival rates in mice poisoned with the anticoagulant warfarin. Supraphysiological amounts of vitamin K sufficiently reversed the effects of warfarin in both wild-type and NQO1-deficient mice. Additionally, vitamin K reductase activities distinct from VKOR (vitamin K epoxide reductase) and NQO1 were measured in vitro from both wild-type and NQO1-defecient mice. The results of the present study suggest that NQO1 does not play a major role in the production of vitamin K hydroquinone and supports the existence of multiple vitamin K reduction pathways. The properties of a NAD(P)H-dependent vitamin K reductase different from NQO1 are described.
ACE (angiotensin-1-converting enzyme) is a zinc metallopeptidase that plays a prominent role in blood pressure regulation and electrolyte homeostasis. ACE consists of two homologous domains that despite similarities of sequence and topology display differences in substrate processing and inhibitor binding. The design of inhibitors that selectively inhibit the N-domain (N-selective) could be useful in treating conditions of tissue injury and fibrosis due to build-up of N-domain-specific substrate Ac-SDKP (N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro). Using a receptor-based SHOP (scaffold hopping) approach with N-selective inhibitor RXP407, a shortlist of scaffolds that consisted of modified RXP407 backbones with novel chemotypes was generated. These scaffolds were selected on the basis of enhanced predicted interaction energies with N-domain residues that differed from their C-domain counterparts. One scaffold was synthesized and inhibitory binding tested using a fluorogenic ACE assay. A molecule incorporating a tetrazole moiety in the P2 position (compound 33RE) displayed potent inhibition (K(i)=11.21±0.74 nM) and was 927-fold more selective for the N-domain than the C-domain. A crystal structure of compound 33RE in complex with the N-domain revealed its mode of binding through aromatic stacking with His388 and a direct hydrogen bond with the hydroxy group of the N-domain specific Tyr369. This work further elucidates the molecular basis for N-domain-selective inhibition and assists in the design of novel N-selective ACE inhibitors that could be employed in treatment of fibrosis disorders.
CYP2E1 metabolizes 1,3-butadiene (BD) into genotoxic and possibly carcinogenic 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (EB), 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB), and 1,2-epoxy-3,4-butanediol (EB-diol). The dose response of DNA and protein adducts derived from BD metabolites increases linearly at low BD exposures and then saturates at higher exposures in rats, but not mice. It was hypothesized that differences in adduct formation between rodents reflect more efficient BD oxidation in mice than rats. Herein, we assessed whether BD-derived metabolites selectively inhibit rat but not mouse CYP2E1 activity using B6C3F1 mouse and Fisher 344 rat liver microsomes. Basal CYP2E1 activities toward 4-nitrophenol were similar between rodents. Through IC50 studies, EB was the strongest inhibitor (IC50 54μM, mouse; 98μM, rat), BD-diol considerably weaker (IC50 1200μM, mouse; 1000μM, rat), and DEB inhibition nonexistent (IC50>25mM). Kinetic studies showed that in both species EB and BD-diol inhibited 4-nitrophenol oxidation through two-site mechanisms in which inhibition constants reflected trends observed in IC50 studies. None of the reactive epoxide metabolites inactivated CYP2E1 irreversibly. Thus, there was no selective inhibition or inactivation of rat CYP2E1 by BD metabolites relative to mouse Cyp2e1, and it can be inferred that CYP2E1 activity toward BD between rodent species would similarly not be impacted by the presence of BD metabolites. Inhibition of CYP2E1 by BD metabolites is then not responsible for the reported species difference in BD metabolism, formation of BD-derived DNA and protein adducts, mutagenicity and tumorigenesis. 
ABO blood group is associated with aetiology of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC); however, the effect of it on survival of patients diagnosed with NPC has not been explored.
CYP2D6 is polymorphically expressed enzyme that show marked interindividual and interethnic variation. Phenotyping of CYP2D6 provides valuable information about real-time activity of this important drug-metabolizing enzymes through the use of specific probe drugs. The aim of this study was to identify the CYP2D6 oxidation phenotype with dextromethorphan (DEX) as a probe drug in Mazandarani ethnic group among Iranian population.
GNE myopathy (also called distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles or hereditary inclusion body myopathy) is an autosomal recessive myopathy characterised by skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness that preferentially involve the distal muscles. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding a key enzyme in sialic acid biosynthesis, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE).
NDUFS3 is an integral subunit of the Q module of the mitochondrial respiratory Complex-I. The combined mutation (T145I + R199W) in the subunit is reported to cause optic atrophy and Leigh syndrome accompanied by severe Complex-I deficiency. In the present study, we have cloned and overexpressed the human NDUFS3 subunit and its double mutant in a soluble form in Escherichia coli. The wild-type (w-t) and mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity through a serial two-step chromatographic purification procedure of anion exchange followed by size exclusion chromatography. The integrity and purity of the purified proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis and MALDI-TOF/TOF. The conformational transitions of the purified subunits were studied through steady state as well as time resolved fluorescence and CD spectroscopy under various denaturing conditions. The mutant protein showed altered polarity around tryptophan residues, changed quenching parameters and also noticeably altered secondary and tertiary structure compared to the w-t protein. Mutant also exhibited a higher tendency than the w-t protein for aggregation which was examined using fluorescent (Thioflavin-T) and spectroscopic (Congo red) dye binding techniques. The pH stability of the w-t and mutant proteins varied at extreme acidic pH and the molten globule like structure of w-t at pH1 was absent in case of the mutant protein. Both the w-t and mutant proteins showed multi-step thermal and Gdn-HCl induced unfolding. Thus, the results provide insight into the alterations of NDUFS3 protein structure caused by the mutations, affecting the overall integrity of the protein and finally leading to disruption of Complex-I assembly.
PIK3R1 mutations cause syndromic insulin resistance with lipoatrophy. Thauvin-Robinet et al. (2013) The American Journal of Human Genetics 93: 141-149 SHORT syndrome with partial lipodystrophy due to impaired phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase signalling. Chudasama et al. (2013) The American Journal of Human Genetics 93: 150-157 Mutations in PIK3R1 cause SHORT syndrome. Dyment et al. (2013) The American Journal of Human Genetics 93: 158-166. 
ABCB1 is a major determinant of opioid bioavailability; however, no previous studies have provided positive evidence of an association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCB1 and opioid usage in acute pain management. The aim of this study was to test the association between the functional SNP C3435T in ABCB1 and opioid consumption in postoperative pain in patients undergoing a nephrectomy. Additionally, we explored the association between C3435T and opioid side effect.
COMT (catechol-O-methyltransferase) has been conjectured to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its key role in cognitive function impairment by influencing the dopamine degradation in prefrontal cortex. A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (rs4680 SNP; G to A) in the COMT coding region causes Val158Met amino acid substitution in the corresponding protein, with Val allele exhibiting markedly 3- to 4-fold higher than Met in enzyme activity. Recent study reported that the functional rs4680 polymorphism within COMT gene was associated with susceptibility to AD in Caucasians. In order to examine the association between polymorphism in COMT gene and late-onset AD (LOAD) in a Han Chinese group, we analyzed the genotype and allele distributions of the COMT rs4680 polymorphism in a Han Chinese population consisting of 2291 individuals (1132 LOAD patients and 1159 healthy controls). In the present study, we find no significant association between the COMT rs4680 polymorphism and LOAD, even after statistical adjustment for age, gender and apolipoprotein E (APOE) status in the total sample as well as stratification for APOE status. Our results indicated that the COMT Val158Met polymorphism may not play a major role in the development of LOAD in Han Chinese. 
PTEN Hamartoma Tumor syndrome (PHTS) includes patients with Cowden syndrome or other syndromes with germline mutation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. The risk for breast, colorectal, and endometrial cancer and polyposis is increased, creating clinical overlap with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), Lynch syndrome (LS), and adenomatous polyposis syndromes (APS). We reviewed our series of patients with PHTS to determine how often testing criteria for these syndromes were met and how often other-gene testing was ordered before testing PTEN.
PTEN loss and constitutive activation of the PI3K signaling pathway have been associated with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer. PTEN-deficient prostate cancer C42Luc cells survive in serum-free media and show relative resistance to apoptosis even in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474. Yet, when ZSTK474 is combined with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide, C42Luc cells undergo apoptosis within 6 hours. We identified dephosphorylation of BAD (Bcl2-associated death promoter) as a main apoptosis-regulatory molecule downstream from PI3K, and loss of MCL-1 (Myeloid cell leukemia -1) as a major target of cycloheximide. The combination of MCL-1 knockdown and expression of phosphorylation-deficient mutant BAD2SA is sufficient to trigger rapid apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. These results establish the mechanism for the synergistic induction of apoptosis by the combination of a PI3K inhibitor and of a protein synthesis inhibitor in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells. 
"FASN plays an important role in the malignant phenotype of various tumors. Our previous studies show that inhibition FASN could induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation in human osteosarcoma (OS) cell in vivo and vitro. The aim in this study was to investigate the effect of inhibition FASN on the activity of HER2/PI3K/AKT axis and invasion and migration of OS cell. The expression of FASN, HER2 and p-HER2(Y1248) proteins was detected by immunohistochemistry in OS tissues from 24 patients with pulmonary metastatic disease, and the relationship between FASN and p-HER2 as well as HER2 was investigated. The results showed that there was a positive correlation between FASN and HER2 as well as p-HER2 protein expression. The U-2 OS cells were transfected with either the FASN specific RNAi plasmid or the negative control RNAi plasmid. FASN mRNA was measured by RT-PCR. Western blot assays was performed to examine the protein expression of FASN, HER2, p-HER2(Y1248), PI3K, Akt and p-Akt (Ser473). Migration and invasion of cells were investigated by wound healing and transwell invasion assays. The results showed that the activity of HER2/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was suppressed by inhibiting FASN. Meanwhile, the U-2OS cells migration and invasion were also impaired by inhibiting the activity of FASN/HER2/PI3K/AKT. Our results indicated that inhibition of FASN suppresses OS cell invasion and migration via down-regulation of the ""HER2/PI3K/AKT"" axis in vitro. FASN blocker may be a new therapeutic strategy in OS management."
GALNT3 gene encodes the glycosyltransferase polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-3 (ppGalNacT3), which initiates the O-glycosylation of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) that is important in phosphorous regulation. Inactivating mutations of the GALNT3 gene can cause familial tumoral calcinosis. The aim of present study is to investigate the association of GALNT3 polymorphisms with osteoporosis phenotypes in Chinese postmenopausal women.
CYP2C19 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme, which is involved in the metabolism of some clinically important medications and is encoded by a highly polymorphic gene. There is no available data on the distribution of the CYP2C19 *4 and *17 mutant alleles in the Saudi Arabian population. The aim of the study was to determine different CYP2C19 mutant allele (*2, *4 and *17) frequencies in healthy Saudi subjects and to determine genotype frequencies for these mutations. The CYP2C19 genotypes were then classified into phenotypes.
CD36 plays an important role in long-chain fatty acid homeostasis in skeletal muscle and the myocardium. CD36 deficiency may lead to reduced myocardial uptake of long-chain fatty acid. Therefore, different mutations of the CD36 gene may contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of cardiac hypertrophy.
HAL 9000. Morpheus. Skynet. These household names demonstrate the strong cultural impact of films depicting themes in cognitive science and the potential power of popular cinema for outreach and education. Considering their wide influence, there is value to aggregating these movies and reflecting on their renderings of our field. The Cognitive Science Movie Index (CSMI) serves these purposes, leveraging popular film for the advancement of the discipline. 
KCNJ11 (potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11) and ABCC8 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C (CFTR/MRP), member 8) have been studied for association with type 2 diabetes in various ethnic populations with contradictory results. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis for KCNJ11 rs5219, rs5210, rs5215, and ABCC8 rs757110 to evaluate the effect of these regions on genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes. Forty-one case-control association studies of KCNJ11 and ABCC8 polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes, including 61,879 subjects, were identified and used in our meta-analysis. Combined odds ratios (OR) of associations of this disease with the rs5219 T, rs5210 G, rs5215 G, and rs757110 G alleles were 1.15 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 1.10-1.21, P < 0.0001], 1.16 (95%CI = 1.08-1.24, P = 0.023), 1.08 (95%CI = 1.02-1.13, P = 0.006), and 1.12 (95%CI = 1.07-1.18, P < 0.0001), respectively. The effect of allele T of rs5219 was similar (OR = 1.16) in Europeans and Japanese. However, rs5219 was not associated with type 2 diabetes in the Chinese Han population. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that KCNJ11 and ABCC8 polymorphisms are associated with risk for type 2 diabetes in the global population. Comparative genomics and bioinformatics analyses revealed that rs5210 is located within a conserved 3'-UTR, and that allele A may abolish the binding site of hsa-miR-1910 that the risk allele G possesses.
ABO incompatibility is no longer a barrier in kidney transplantation. C4d is frequently positive in ABO-incompatible (iABO) biopsies without further signs of microcirculation injury. This phenomenon is assumed to represent graft accommodation. However, ultrastructural examination of glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelium might reveal subtle endothelial damage.
SUCLA2 encodes the ATP-forming β subunit (A-SUCL-β) of succinyl-CoA ligase, an enzyme of the citric acid cycle. Mutations in SUCLA2 lead to a mitochondrial disorder manifesting as encephalomyopathy with dystonia, deafness and lesions in the basal ganglia. Despite the distinct brain pathology associated with SUCLA2 mutations, the precise localization of SUCLA2 protein has never been investigated. Here, we show that immunoreactivity of A-SUCL-β in surgical human cortical tissue samples was present exclusively in neurons, identified by their morphology and visualized by double labeling with a fluorescent Nissl dye. A-SUCL-β immunoreactivity co-localized >99 % with that of the d subunit of the mitochondrial F0-F1 ATP synthase. Specificity of the anti-A-SUCL-β antiserum was verified by the absence of labeling in fibroblasts from a patient with a complete deletion of SUCLA2. A-SUCL-β immunoreactivity was absent in glial cells, identified by antibodies directed against the glial markers GFAP and S100. Furthermore, in situ hybridization histochemistry demonstrated that SUCLA2 mRNA was present in Nissl-labeled neurons but not glial cells labeled with S100. Immunoreactivity of the GTP-forming β subunit (G-SUCL-β) encoded by SUCLG2, or in situ hybridization histochemistry for SUCLG2 mRNA could not be demonstrated in either neurons or astrocytes. Western blotting of post mortem brain samples revealed minor G-SUCL-β immunoreactivity that was, however, not upregulated in samples obtained from diabetic versus non-diabetic patients, as has been described for murine brain. Our work establishes that SUCLA2 is expressed exclusively in neurons in the human cerebral cortex.
CD36 is a multifunctional protein that enhances cellular fatty acid (FA) uptake, a key step in energy metabolism, and its dysregulation in multiple tissue sites is central to obesity-linked diabetes, a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Although CD36 has been implicated in FA uptake in a correlative way, the molecular mechanisms are not known. Their elucidation in cells is confounded by receptor-mediated uptake of low-density lipoprotein by CD36 and the competitive and/or contributive effects of other proteins involved in FA transport and metabolism, which include caveolin(s), fatty acid transport protein (FATP), intracellular fatty acid binding protein, and enzymes involved in the conversion of FAs to esters. Here we utilized a simpler cellular system (HEK cells), which lack caveolin-1, CD36, and FATP and metabolize FAs slowly compared to the time frame of transmembrane FA movement. Our previous studies of HEK cells showed that caveolin-1 affects FA binding and translocation across the plasma membrane and but not FA esterification [Simard, J. R., et al. (2010) J. Lipid Res. 51 (5), 914-922]. Our key new finding is that CD36 accelerates FA uptake and extensive incorporation into triglycerides, a process that is slower (minutes) than transmembrane movement (seconds). Real-time fluorescence measurements showed that the rates of binding and transport of oleic acid into cells with and without CD36 were not different. Thus, CD36 enhances intracellular metabolism, i.e., esterification, and thereby increases the rate of FA uptake without catalyzing the translocation of FA across the plasma membrane, suggesting that CD36 is central to FA uptake via its effects on intracellular metabolism. 
RPE is a key component of the blood-ocular barrier (BOB) and is equipped with immunological molecules such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and complement receptors, which together orchestrate the innate and adaptive immunity of the eye. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the aqueous humor and vitreous body has traditionally been thought to be derived from serum via transcytosis across the BOB. Our previous work validated production of endogenous IgG by RPE cells locally. However, the function and role of this IgG in the intraocular immunity is poorly understood.
"ALDH7A1 and PNPO deficiencies are rare inborn errors of vitamin B6 metabolism causing perinatal seizure disorders. The phenotypic variability, however, is broad. To assess the frequency of these deficiencies in unexplained infantile epilepsy, we screened 113 patients for mutations in both genes. We identified 1 patient with an epilepsy phenotype resembling Dravet syndrome and likely pathogenic mutations in ALDH7A1. Presenting features were highly atypical of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, including febrile seizures, response to anticonvulsive drugs, and periods of seizure freedom without pyridoxine treatment. ""Hidden"" vitamin B6 deficiencies might be rare but treatable causes of unexplained epilepsy extending beyond the classical phenotypes. "
PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes (PHTS) are a spectrum of hamartomatous overgrowth syndromes associated with germ-line mutations in the tumor suppressor PTEN gene located on 10q23.3. It is widely accepted that two of these disorders, Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, are allelic conditions. Because PTEN mutations are not identifiable in every case of the PHTS phenotype, the inability to detect a mutation within the PTEN gene does not invalidate the clinical diagnosis of Cowden syndrome, or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, in patients who meet diagnostic criteria for these disorders. PTEN mutations are associated with an increased risk for developing breast, thyroid, endometrial, and sometimes renal cancers. Thus, cancer surveillance is the cornerstone of PHTS patient management. Although a consensus cancer surveillance protocol has not been formally instituted, all PTEN mutation carriers should adopt the cancer surveillance strategies proposed for patients with Cowden syndrome. In addition, because gastrointestinal and vascular complications can be more severe in Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome than in Cowden syndrome, patients with Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome should be monitored from this point of view too. In this study, we report on two cases with Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba phenotype that showed two different PTEN mutations. We also propose practice recommendations for management of PHTS patients.
CYP2D6 is considered the key enzyme in tamoxifen metabolism. Several studies have investigated the relationship between the CYP2D6 genotype and tamoxifen treatment outcome, with discrepant results. CYP2D6 inhibitor use, aromatase inhibitor use, and chemotherapy may account for some of the discrepancies. We examined the association between CYP2D6 genotype and early breast cancer events in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients, in relation to CYP2D6 inhibitor use, aromatase inhibitor use, and chemotherapy.
ABO incompatibility is a barrier for solid organ transplantation, but not for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To investigate tolerance induction, we enrolled patients who had undergone minor ABO-incompatible (O into A group, n = 6) and ABO-identical (O into O group, n = 4) bone marrow transplantation (BMT). None of the six O into A patients were positive for recipient-specific (anti-blood group A) isohemagglutinins, whereas all four O into O patients were. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were engrafted into NOD/SCID/gamma(c)(null) (NOG) mice, followed by sensitization of blood group A red blood cells. Anti-blood group A antibodies (Abs) in the sera of the patients and the human PBMC-engrafted NOG mice were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Anti-blood group A Abs in the patients' sera were significantly correlated with anti-A isohemagglutinin titers (p < 0.01). In the human PBMC-engrafted NOG mice, anti-blood group A Abs were significantly lower in the O into A group than in the O into O group (p < 0.05), despite ex vivo restimulation of B cells. The results of this study suggest that long after receiving minor ABO-incompatible BMT, B cells derived from newly engrafted donor precursor cells were induced tolerance to recipient-specific antigens.
CXXC5 is a member of a small subset of proteins containing CXXC-type zinc-finger domain. Here, we show that CXXC5 is a transcription factor activating Flk-1, a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor. CXXC5 and Flk-1 were accumulated in nucli and membrane of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), respectively, during their endothelial differentiation. CXXC5 overexpression induced Flk-1 transcription in both endothelium-differentiated mESCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In vitro DNA binding assay showed direct interaction of CXXC5 on the Flk-1 promoter region, and mutation on its DNA-binding motif abolished transcriptional activity. We showed that bone morphorgenetic protein 4 (BMP4) induced CXXC5 transcription in the cells, and inhibitors of BMP signaling suppressed the CXXC5 induction and the consequent Flk-1 induction by BMP4 treatment. CXXC5 knockdown resulted in suppression of BMP4-induced stress fiber formation (56.8 ± 1.3% decrease, P<0.05) and migration (54.6 ± 1.9% decrease, P<0.05) in HUVECs. The in vivo roles of CXXC5 in BMP-signaling-specific vascular development and angiogenesis were shown by specific defect of caudal vein plex vessel formation (57.9 ± 11.8% decrease, P<0.05) in cxxc5 morpholino-injected zebrafish embryos and by suppression of BMP4-induced angiogenesis in subcutaneously injected Matrigel plugs in CXXC5(-/-) mice. Overall, CXXC5 is a transcriptional activator for Flk-1, mediating BMP signaling for differentiation and migration of endothelial cell and vessel formation.
PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) refers to a spectrum of disorders caused by mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene. Diagnostic criteria for Cowden syndrome, the principal PTEN-related disorder, were first established in 1996 before the identification of the PTEN gene and the ability to molecularly confirm a clinical diagnosis. These consortium criteria were based on clinical experience and case reports in the existing literature, with their inherent selection biases. Although it was initially reported that approximately 80% of patients with Cowden syndrome had an identifiable germline PTEN mutation, more recent work has shown these diagnostic criteria to be far less specific. In addition, increasing evidence has documented the association of a broader spectrum of clinical features with PTEN mutations. Our goal was to develop revised, evidence-based diagnostic criteria and to include features of the broader spectrum of PTEN-related clinical syndromes.
PTEN is one of the most frequently mutated or deleted tumor suppressors in human cancers. NEDD4-1 was recently identified as the E3 ubiquitin ligase for PTEN; however, a number of important questions remain regarding the role of ubiquitination in regulating PTEN function and the mechanisms by which PTEN ubiquitination is regulated. In the present study, we demonstrated that p34, which was identified as a binding partner of NEDD4-1, controls PTEN ubiquitination by regulating NEDD4-1 protein stability. p34 interacts with the WW1 domain of NEDD4-1, an interaction that enhances NEDD4-1 stability. Expression of p34 promotes PTEN poly-ubiquitination, leading to PTEN protein degradation, whereas p34 knockdown results in PTEN mono-ubiquitination. Notably, an inverse correlation between PTEN and p34/NEDD4-1 levels was confirmed in tumor samples from colon cancer patients. Thus, p34 acts as a key regulator of the oncogenic behavior of NEDD4-1 and PTEN. 
ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) counterbalances the actions of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) by metabolizing its catalytic product, the vasoactive and fibrogenic peptide AngII (angiotensin II), into Ang-(1-7) [angiotensin-(1-7)]. Enhanced ACE2 expression may be protective in diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, relatively little is known about the specific physiological factors regulating ACE2 expression. In the present paper, we show, by Western blotting and qPCR (quantitative real-time PCR), that ACE2 expression is increased under conditions of cell stress, including hypoxic conditions, IL (interleukin)-1β treatment and treatment with the AMP mimic AICAR (5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside). The NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 (silent information regulator T1) was found to be up-regulated after AICAR treatment but, conversely, was down-regulated after IL-1β treatment. ChIP analysis demonstrated that SIRT1 bound to the ACE2 promoter and that binding was increased after AICAR treatment, but decreased after IL-1β treatment. Inhibition of SIRT1 activity ablated the AICAR-induced increase in ACE2. In conclusion, we have established that the expression of the ACE2 transcript is controlled by the activity of SIRT1 under conditions of energy stress. 
IDH1 mutations in gliomas associate with longer survival. Prooxidant and antiproliferative effects of IDH1 mutations and its D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) product have been described in vitro, but inconsistently observed. It is also unclear whether overexpression of mutant IDH1 in wild-type cells accurately phenocopies the effects of endogenous IDH1-mutations on tumor apoptosis and autophagy. Herein we investigated the effects of 2-HG and mutant IDH1 overexpression on proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and autophagy in IDH1 wild-type glioma cells, and compared those results with patient-derived tumors. 2-HG reduced viability and proliferation of U87MG and LN18 cells, triggered apoptosis in LN18 cells, and autophagy in U87MG cells. In vitro studies and flank xenografts of U87MG cells overexpressing R132H IDH1 exhibited increased oxidative stress, including increases of both manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and p62. Patient-derived IDH1-mutant tumors showed no significant differences in apoptosis or autophagy, but showed p62 accumulation and actually trended toward reduced MnSOD expression. These data indicate that mutant IDH1 and 2-HG can induce oxidative stress, autophagy, and apoptosis, but these effects vary greatly according to cell type. 
ABO blood group matching policy between donor and recipients is a chief element of organ allocation. However, O blood group donors may donate to all other blood group recipients, and ABO cross-transplantation has led to excessively long delays for blood group O. To investigate the consequence of this problem, we analyzed the recipients/donor rates according to ABO blood groups and cross-transplantation rates among them. Data about deceased donors and liver transplants performed in Korea from January 2008 to September 2012 were reviewed. The proportion of recipient to donor in the O blood group was lower compared to non-O groups (0.61). The percentage of O blood group transplantations in the Korean Network for Organ Sharing (KONOS) status 2B was lower than non-O groups (13.6%). In the status 1 and 2A groups, 44.4% of O blood group donors were allocated to non-O transplantations. Also, 30.7% O blood group donors were allocated to non-O transplantations in the status 2B groups. In conclusion, the ABO cross-transplantation in blood group O donors has led to lower transplantation rates of blood group O in status 1, 2A, and especially, the 2B group. Therefore, the KONOS allocation system should be re-evaluated to address this problem. 
CYP4A11 is a member of the cytochrome P450 enzymes and is responsible for metabolizing arachidonic acid to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a metabolite involved in the regulation of blood pressure. This study aimed to evaluate whether or not the CYP4A11 gene polymorphism T8590C (rs1126742) is involved in essential hypertension in the western Chinese Han population.
KCNJ8 (NM_004982) encodes the pore forming subunit of one of the ATP-sensitive inwardly rectifying potassium (KATP) channels. KCNJ8 sequence variations are traditionally associated with J-wave syndromes, involving ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Recently, the KATP gene ABCC9 (SUR2, NM_020297) has been associated with the multi-organ disorder Cantú syndrome or hypertrichotic osteochondrodysplasia (MIM 239850) (hypertrichosis, macrosomia, osteochondrodysplasia, and cardiomegaly). Here, we report on a patient with a de novo nonsynonymous KCNJ8 SNV (p.V65M) and Cantú syndrome, who tested negative for mutations in ABCC9. The genotype and multi-organ abnormalities of this patient are reviewed. A careful screening of the KATP genes should be performed in all individuals diagnosed with Cantú syndrome and no mutation in ABCC9. 
SLC26A3 [downregulated in adenoma (DRA)] is a Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchanger involved in electroneutral NaCl absorption in the mammalian intestine. Altered DRA expression levels are associated with infectious and inflammatory diarrheal diseases. Therefore, it is critical to understand the regulation of DRA expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, small RNAs that regulate protein expression via blocking the translation and/or promoting mRNA degradation. To investigate potential modulation of DRA expression by miRNA, five different in silico algorithms were used to predict the miRNAs that target DRA. Of these miRNAs, miR-494 was shown to have a highly conserved putative binding site in the DRA 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) compared with other DRA-targeting miRNAs in vertebrates. Transfection with pmirGLO dual luciferase vector containing DRA 3'-UTR (pmirGLO-3'-UTR DRA) resulted in a significant decrease in relative luciferase activity compared with empty vector. Cotransfection of the DRA 3'-UTR luciferase vector with a miR-494 mimic further decreased luciferase activity compared with cells transfected with negative control. The transfection of a miR-494 mimic into Caco-2 and T-84 cells significantly increased the expression of miR-494 and concomitantly decreased the DRA protein expression. Mutation of the seed sequences for miR-494 in 3'-UTR of DRA abrogated the effect of miR-494 on 3'-UTR. These data demonstrate a novel regulatory mechanism of DRA expression via miR-494 and indicate that targeting this microRNA may serve to be a potential therapeutic strategy for diarrheal diseases. 
CYP2E1 is an important cytochrome P450 isoform in many endogenous processes and in the metabolism of organic solvents, a number of drugs and pre-carcinogens. Information on the abundance of the enzyme may be valuable in various types of research in the field of toxicology and pharmacology. An indirect ELISA for the quantification of CYP2E1 in human liver microsomes was developed and successfully validated. All samples, including validation samples and calibrators, were diluted to a final concentration of microsomal protein of 10μg/ml. Detection of the antigen was obtained through binding of a polyclonal antibody raised against the full length protein, followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies and enzymatic detection. A five-parameter logistics function with 1/x weighting was used for quantification within the concentration range of 4-256pmol CYP2E1/mg microsomal protein. The method showed acceptable intra- and inter-assay precision, with calculated coefficients of variation of 6.3-15.2% and 11.3-21.0%, respectively. The relative error varied between -2.3 and 8.9%, and the total error between 16.0 and 27.2%. No significant cross reactivity with other abundant CYP isoforms was observed. The method was evaluated through the analysis of samples from a pharmacokinetic study, and the comparison with the CYP2E1 activity in those samples. 
ABO blood group incompatible renal transplantation, using desensitization procedures, is an effective strategy. Efforts have been made to reduce desensitization: these are usually applied to all patients indiscriminately. The Guy's Hospital ABO blood group incompatible desensitization regimen uses a tiered approach, tailoring strategy according to initial antibody titres. Sixty-two ABO blood group incompatible living donor transplant recipients were compared with 167 recipients of blood group compatible living donor renal transplants. There were no statistically significant differences in allograft survival rates at 1 or 3 years post-transplant, rejection in the first year post-transplant or renal function in the first 3 years post-transplant. There was a higher rate of death in ABO blood group incompatible transplant recipients - this could be associated with differences in age and HLA mismatch between the two groups. Four ABO blood group incompatible patients experienced antibody-mediated rejection (no episode was associated with a rise in ABO blood group antibodies). Of the patients who received no desensitization, or rituximab alone, none has experienced antibody mediated rejection or experienced allograft loss. Tailoring the use of desensitization in ABO blood group incompatible renal transplantation according to initial ABO blood group antibody titres led to comparable results to blood group compatible transplantation.
CYP2D6 polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) susceptibility, but the results of these previous studies were inconsistent.
ACE Inhibitors (ACE-I) and Angiotensin-Receptor Antagonists (ARAs) are commonly prescribed but can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) during intercurrent illness. Rates of hospitalization with AKI are increasing. We aimed to determine whether hospital AKI admission rates are associated with increased ACE-I/ARA prescribing.
CYP21A2 gene mutations in a child with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and the child's parents, were detected in the study. The clinical features, treatment monitoring and molecular genetic mechanism of CAH are reviewed. In the study, DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples using the QIAGEN Blood DNA Mini Kit; a highly specific PCR primer for CYP21A2 gene was designed according to the sequence difference between CYP2lA2 gene and its pseudogene; the whole CYP2lA2 gene was amplified with PrimeSTAR DNA polymerase (Takara), and the amplification product was directly sequenced to detect and analyze CYP2lA2 gene mutation. The child was clinically diagnosed with CAH (21-hydroxylase deficiency, 21-OHD) at the age of 36 days, and the case was confirmed by genetic diagnosis at the age of 1.5 years. The proband had a homozygous mutation at c.293-13C in the second intron of CYP21 gene, while the parents had heterozygous mutations. Early diagnosis and standard treatment of CAH (21-OHD) should be performed to prevent salt-wasting crisis and reduce mortality; bone aging should be avoided to increase final adult height (FAH), and reproductive dysfunction due to oligospermia in adulthood should be avoided. These factors are helpful for improving prognosis and increasing FAH. Investigating the molecular genetic mechanism of CAH can improve recognition and optimize diagnosis of this disease. In addition, carrier diagnosis and genetic counseling for the proband family are of great significance. 
PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10, 10q23.3) is the dominant phosphatase responsible for the dephosphorylation of the 3-position phosphate from the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate (PIP3), and thereby directly antagonizes the actions mediated by Phosphatidylinositol-3 Kinase (PI3K). PI3K functions in numerous pathways and cellular processes, including tumourigenesis. Therefore, mechanisms regulating PTEN function, either positively or negatively are of great interest not only to oncogenesis but also to other aspects of human health. Since its discovery in 1997, PTEN has been one of the most-heavily studied tumour suppressors and has been the subject of numerous reviews. Most investigations and reviews center on PTEN's function and its regulation. While the regulation of PTEN function via genetic and/or epigenetic mechanisms has been extensively studied, the impact of protein-protein interaction on PTEN function remains less clear. Recent research has revealed that PTEN can be specifically inhibited by its interaction with other proteins, which are collectively termed PTEN-negative regulators (PTENNRs). This review will summarize our current understanding on the protein network that influences PTEN function with a specific focus on PTEN-NRs. 
KMT2D (lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D), formerly named MLL2 (myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 2, also known as ALR/MLL4), is a histone methyltransferase that plays an important role in regulating gene transcription. In particular, it targets histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4), whose methylations serve as a gene activation mark. Recently, KMT2D has emerged as one of the most frequently mutated genes in a variety of cancers and in other human diseases, including lymphoma, medulloblastoma, gastric cancer, and Kabuki syndrome. Mutations in KMT2D identified thus far point to its loss-of-function in pathogenesis and suggest its role as a tumor suppressor in various tissues. To determine the effect of a KMT2D deficiency on neoplastic cells, we used homologous recombination- and nuclease-mediated gene editing approaches to generate a panel of isogenic colorectal and medulloblastoma cancer cell lines that differ with respect to their endogenous KMT2D status. We found that a KMT2D deficiency resulted in attenuated cancer cell proliferation and defective cell migration. Analysis of histone H3 modifications revealed that KMT2D was essential for maintaining the level of global H3K4 monomethylation and that its enzymatic SET domain was directly responsible for this function. Furthermore, we found that a majority of KMT2D binding sites are located in regions of potential enhancer elements. Together, these findings revealed the role of KMT2D in regulating enhancer elements in human cells and shed light on the tumorigenic role of its deficiency. Our study supports that KMT2D has distinct roles in neoplastic cells, as opposed to normal cells, and that inhibiting KMT2D may be a viable strategy for cancer therapeutics. 
CA1 region of hippocampus has an important role in learning and memory. Previous reports have shown that androgens like testosterone and its metabolites are present in high concentration in CA1 region of hippocampus. Androgen receptors have also high density in this region. Therefore, it is suggested that neurohormones in CA1 have an important role in learning and memory. It is likely that testosterone exerts its effect via its metabolites, especially dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a 5α-reduced androgen. In this research, we conducted an experiment to assess the path of testosterone›s effectiveness on spatial learning and memory. Adult male rats were randomly divided into 4 groups and, bilaterally, cannulated into CA1 region of hippocampus. One week after the surgery, animals received DMSO 0.5 μL as a control group and different doses of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (0.25, 0.5 and 1 µg/0.5 μL/side) 25-30 min before the training in spatial version of Morris Water Maze task. Training session contained two blocks which animals had to learn the position of hidden platform in 4 trials. On the test session (next day), rats performed a one-trial probe test and then a visible platform one. The results showed that escape latency and traveled distance were decreased significantly in DHT-treated (0.5 µg/0.5 μL/side) rats. This finding suggested that DHT may have improved the effect on acquisition of spatial learning and memory. 
GNE myopathy is a rare neuromuscular autosomal recessive disease, resulting from mutations in the gene UDP N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE). The most frequent mutation is the single homozygous missense mutation, M712T-the Middle Eastern mutation-located ten amino acids before the end of the protein. We have used an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based trans-splicing (TS) vector as a gene therapy tool to overcome this mutation by replacing the mutated last exon of GNE by the wild-type exon while preserving the natural endogenous regulatory machinery. We have designed relevant plasmids directed either to mouse or to human GNE. Following transfection of C2C12 murine muscle cells with the mouse TS vectors, we have been able to detect by nested RT-PCR trans-spliced molecules carrying the wild-type exon 12 of GNE. Similarly, transfection of HEK293 human cells with the human-directed TS vectors resulted in the generation of trans-spliced human GNE RNA molecules. Furthermore, infection of primary muscle cells from a GNE myopathy patient carrying the homozygous M712T mutation, with an AAV8-based viral vector carrying a human-directed TS construct, resulted in the generation of wild-type GNE transcripts in addition to the mutated ones. These studies provide a proof of concept that the TS approach could be used to partially correct the Middle Eastern mutation in GNE myopathy patients. These results provide the basis for in vivo research in animal models using the AAV platform with TS plasmids as a potential genetic therapy for GNE myopathy. 
PAH associated with connective tissue diseases is associated with significant functional impairment and morbidity, and carries with it a poor prognosis. The mortality is as high as 10% to 15% in the first year after diagnosis; making it a devastating disease. The availability of ever-increasing numbers of treatment options in the recent era have improved survival in this patient population and have made early and accurate diagnosis a more important goal. According to the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Disease Management (REVEAL), 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 7-year survival rates from time of diagnostic right-sided heart catheterization in patients with PAH were found to be 85%, 68%, 57%, and 49%, respectively, which is a considerable improvement since the National Institutes of Health registry 2 decades previously. In a study by Condliffe and colleagues, survival rates in patients with SSC-associated PAH have improved to 78%at 1 year and 47% at 3 years. Patients with SLE-related PAH have a much higher survival rate of up to 75% at 3 years. Proper screening, early diagnosis, and early treatment can have a significant impact in reducing morbidity and mortality. A small study to assess outcomes in patients with asymptomatic CTD found to have exercise induced PAH suggest that bosentan may be safe and effective in improving the hemodynamics and outcomes in these patients. This study included only 10 patients, and additional randomized trials with larger numbers of subjects are needed to affirm this hypothesis. Studies are under way to find additional therapeutic modalities in the form of PDGF receptor blockers, VEGF blockers, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, endothelial dysfunction inhibitors, multikinase inhibitor of Raf-1, serotonin receptor antagonists,and rho kinase inhibitors. Despite these, clinical suspicion, early diagnosis, early
ABO encodes a glycosyltranferase which determines the major human histo-blood group. The FUT2 fucosyltransferase allows expression of ABO antigens on the gastrointestinal mucosa and in bodily secretions (secretor phenotype). A nonsense allele in FUT2 represents a susceptibility variant for Crohn's disease, and both the secretor and ABO blood group status affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Thus, we evaluated if variants in ABO might represent good candidates as Crohn's disease susceptibility loci.
CD36 and two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), i.e., GPR120 and GPR40, have been implicated in the gustatory perception of dietary fats in rodents. These glycoproteins are coupled to increases in free intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations, [Ca²⁺](i), during their activation by dietary long-chain fatty acids (LCFA). The transient receptor potential type M5 (TRPM5) channel, activated by [Ca²⁺](i), participates in downstream signaling in taste bud cells (TBC). The mice, knocked-out for expression of CD36, GPR120, GPR40 or TRPM5 have a reduced spontaneous preference for fat. The delayed rectifying K⁺ (DRK) channels believed to lie downstream of these receptors are also important players in fat taste transduction. The trigeminal neurons by triggering increases in [Ca²⁺](i) may influence the taste signal to afferent nerve fibers. Why are there so many taste receptor candidates for one taste modality? We discuss the recent advances on the role of CD36, GPR120, GPR40, TRPM5 and DRK channels, in signal transduction in TBC. We shed light on their cross-talk and delineate their roles in obesity as a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind their regulation could eventually lead to new strategies to fight against this condition.
CYP4A11 oxidizes endogenous arachidonic acid to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a renal vasoconstrictor and natriuretic in humans. Previous studies demonstrated an association between a functional variant (T8590C) of CYP4A11 and essential hypertension, though with conflicting results. To elucidate this relationship, a case-control study and meta-analysis were performed to assess the possible association of essential hypertension with CYP4A11 genetic variations.
CD36 is a scavenger receptor with multiple ligands and cellular functions, including facilitating cellular uptake of free fatty acids (FFAs). Chronic alcohol consumption increases hepatic CD36 expression, leading to the hypothesis that this promotes uptake of circulating FFAs, which then serve as a substrate for triglyceride (TG) synthesis and the development of alcoholic steatosis. We investigated this hypothesis in alcohol-fed wild-type and Cd36-deficient (Cd36(-/-)) mice using low-fat/high-carbohydrate Lieber-DeCarli liquid diets, positing that Cd36(-/-) mice would be resistant to alcoholic steatosis. Our data show that the livers of Cd36(-/-) mice are resistant to the lipogenic effect of consuming high-carbohydrate liquid diets. These mice also do not further develop alcoholic steatosis when chronically fed alcohol. Surprisingly, we did not detect an effect of alcohol or CD36 deficiency on hepatic FFA uptake; however, the lower baseline levels of hepatic TG in Cd36(-/-) mice fed a liquid diet were associated with decreased expression of genes in the de novo lipogenesis pathway and a lower rate of hepatic de novo lipogenesis. In conclusion, Cd36(-/-) mice are resistant to hepatic steatosis when fed a high-carbohydrate liquid diet, and they are also resistant to alcoholic steatosis. These studies highlight an important role for CD36 in hepatic lipid homeostasis that is not associated with hepatic fatty acid uptake. 
GNE myopathy is characterized by early-adult-onset distal myopathy sparing quadriceps caused by mutations in the GNE gene encoding UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase, an enzyme in the sialic-acid synthesis pathway.
IDH1 gene mutations identify gliomas with a distinct molecular evolutionary origin. We sought to determine the impact of surgical resection on survival after controlling for IDH1 status in malignant astrocytomas-World Health Organization grade III anaplastic astrocytomas and grade IV glioblastoma.
SLC12A3 encodes the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC), which is primarily expressed in the kidney, but also in intestine and bone. In the kidney, NCC is located in the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule. Although NCC reabsorbs only 5 to 10% of filtered sodium, it is important for the fine-tuning of renal sodium excretion in response to various hormonal and non-hormonal stimuli. Several new roles for NCC in the regulation of sodium, potassium, and blood pressure have been unraveled recently. For example, the recent discoveries that NCC is activated by angiotensin II but inhibited by dietary potassium shed light on how the kidney handles sodium during hypovolemia (high angiotensin II) and hyperkalemia. The additive effect of angiotensin II and aldosterone maximizes sodium reabsorption during hypovolemia, whereas the inhibitory effect of potassium on NCC increases delivery of sodium to the potassium-secreting portion of the nephron. In addition, great steps have been made in unraveling the molecular machinery that controls NCC. This complex network consists of kinases and ubiquitinases, including WNKs, SGK1, SPAK, Nedd4-2, Cullin-3, and Kelch-like 3. The pathophysiological significance of this network is illustrated by the fact that modification of each individual protein in the network changes NCC activity and results in salt-dependent hypotension or hypertension. This review aims to summarize these new insights in an integrated manner while identifying unanswered questions.
"ABCG2 is a key human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter mediating cancer cell chemoresistance. In the case of ABCC1, another multidrug transporter, earlier findings documented that certain modulators greatly increase ABCC1-mediated glutathione (GSH) efflux and, upon depletion of intracellular GSH, induce ""collateral sensitivity"" leading to the apoptosis of multidrug resistant cells. Recently, it has been suggested that ABCG2 may mediate an active GSH transport. In order to explore if ABCG2-overexpressing cells may be similarly targeted, we first looked for the effects of ABCG2 expression on cellular GSH levels, and for an ABCG2-dependent GSH transport in HEK293 and MCF7 cells. We found that, while ABCG2 overexpression altered intracellular GSH levels in these transfected or drug-selected cells, ABCG2 inhibitors or transport modulators did not influence GSH efflux. We then performed direct measurements of drug-stimulated ATPase activity and (3)H-GSH transport in inside-out membrane vesicles of human ABC transporter-overexpressing Sf9 insect cells. Our results indicate that ABCG2-ATPase is not modulated by GSH and, in contrast to ABCC1, ABCG2 does not catalyze any significant GSH transport. Our data suggest no direct interaction between the ABCG2 transporter and GSH, although a long-term modulation of cellular GSH by ABCG2 cannot be excluded. "
CYP2D6 polymorphism analysis is gaining increasing interest in forensic pharmacogenetics. Nevertheless, DNA recovered from forensic samples could be of poor quality and not suitable for long polymerase chain reaction required to type CYP2D6 gene prior to SNaPshot minisequencing analysis performed to define alleles with different enzymatic activity. We developed and validated following the guidelines of the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods a tetraplex PCR yielding four amplicons of 597, 803, 1142, and 1659 bp encompassing the entire CYP2D6 gene to analyze eleven SNP positions by SNaPshot minisequencing. Concordance, sensitivity, and specificity were assessed. The method, applied to thirty-two forensic samples failed to amplify with long PCR, allowed the amplification of CYP2D6 gene in 62.5% of degraded samples. The new tetraplex PCR appears a suitable method for CYP2D6 analysis in forensic pharmacogenetics.
ABO antigens are expressed on the surfaces of red blood cells and the vascular endothelium. We studied circulating endothelial microparticles (EMP) in ABO haemolytic disease of the newborn (ABO HDN) as a marker of endothelial activation to test a hypothesis of possible endothelial injury in neonates with ABO HDN, and its relation with the occurrence and severity of haemolysis.
ABO blood type is an established prognostic factor for several malignancies but its role in bladder urothelial carcinoma is largely unknown. We determined whether ABO blood type is associated with the outcome of transurethral resection of nonmuscle invasive bladder urothelial carcinoma.
CLYBL is a human mitochondrial enzyme of unknown function that is found in multiple eukaryotic taxa and conserved to bacteria. The protein is expressed in the mitochondria of all mammalian organs, with highest expression in brown fat and kidney. Approximately 5% of all humans harbor a premature stop polymorphism in CLYBL that has been associated with reduced levels of circulating vitamin B12. Using comparative genomics, we now show that CLYBL is strongly co-expressed with and co-evolved specifically with other components of the mitochondrial B12 pathway. We confirm that the premature stop polymorphism in CLYBL leads to a loss of protein expression. To elucidate the molecular function of CLYBL, we used comparative operon analysis, structural modeling and enzyme kinetics. We report that CLYBL encodes a malate/β-methylmalate synthase, converting glyoxylate and acetyl-CoA to malate, or glyoxylate and propionyl-CoA to β-methylmalate. Malate synthases are best known for their established role in the glyoxylate shunt of plants and lower organisms and are traditionally described as not occurring in humans. The broader role of a malate/β-methylmalate synthase in human physiology and its mechanistic link to vitamin B12 metabolism remain unknown. 
CYP2E1 plays a role in the metabolic activation and elimination of aniline, yet there are conflicting reports on its mechanism of action, and hence relevance, in aniline metabolism. Based on our work with similar compounds, we hypothesized that aniline binds two CYP2E1 sites during metabolism resulting in cooperative reaction kinetics and tested this hypothesis through rigorous in vitro studies. The kinetic profile for recombinant CYP2E1 demonstrated significant negative cooperativity based on a fit of data to the Hill equation (n=0.56). Mechanistically, the data were best explained through a two-binding site cooperative model in which aniline binds with high affinity (K(s)=30 μM) followed by a second weaker binding event (K(ss)=1100 uM) resulting in a threefold increase in the oxidation rate. Binding sites for aniline were confirmed by inhibition studies with 4-methylpyrazole. Inhibitor phenotyping experiments with human liver microsomes validated the central role for CYP2E1 in aniline hydroxylation and indicated minor roles for CYP2A6 and CYP2C9. Importantly, inhibition of minor metabolic pathways resulted in a kinetic profile for microsomal CYP2E1 that replicated the preferred mechanism and parameters observed with the recombinant enzyme. Scaled modeling of in vitro CYP2E1 metabolism of aniline to in vivo clearance, especially at low aniline levels, led to significant deviations from the traditional model based on non-cooperative, Michaelis-Menten kinetics. These findings provide a critical mechanistic perspective on the potential importance of CYP2E1 in the metabolic activation and elimination of aniline as well as the first experimental evidence of a negatively cooperative metabolic reaction catalyzed by CYP2E1.
CD36 is an integral membrane protein which is thought to have a hairpin-like structure with alpha-helices at the C and N terminals projecting through the membrane as well as a larger extracellular loop. This receptor interacts with a number of ligands including oxidized low density lipoprotein and long chain fatty acids (LCFAs). It is also implicated in lipid metabolism and heart diseases. It is therefore important to determine the 3D structure of the CD36 site involved in lipid binding. In this study, we predict the 3D structure of the fatty acid (FA) binding site [127-279 aa] of the CD36 receptor based on homology modeling with X-ray structure of Human Muscle Fatty Acid Binding Protein (PDB code: 1HMT). Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the resulting model suggests that this model was reliable and stable, taking in consideration over 97.8% of the residues in the most favored regions as well as the significant overall quality factor. Protein analysis, which relied on the secondary structure prediction of the target sequence and the comparison of 1HMT and CD36 [127-279 aa] secondary structures, led to the determination of the amino acid sequence consensus. These results also led to the identification of the functional sites on CD36 and revealed the presence of residues which may play a major role during ligand-protein interactions. 
PIK3CA gene mutations are found in numerous cancers but correlate differently with prognosis. Although the frequency of PIK3CA gene mutation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has been previously studied, a prognostic analysis has not been reported. Ninety-six surgically resected ESCC tissues were collected from Chinese patients and DNA was extracted. Gene mutations in PIK3CA (exons 9 and 20), EGFR (exons 18, 19, 20 and 21), KRAS (exons 2 and 3), and BRAF (exons 11 and 15) were screened using mutant-enriched liquid chip technology. PIK3CA gene mutations were identified in 12 of 96 ESCC cases (12.5%). No mutations were identified in EGFR, KRAS or BRAF genes in this study. Correlations between clinicopathological features and PIK3CA mutation status were analyzed and finally, patient survival information was used to determine the prognostic significance of PIK3CA mutation. Interestingly, the frequency of PIK3CA mutation was higher in female ESCC patients (31.3%, 5/16) than in males (8.8%, 7/80), and higher in patients with non-lymph node metastasis (19.6%, 10/51, P = .013) than in patients with lymph node metastasis (4.4%, 2/45, P = .025). Furthermore, patients with PIK3CA-mutated tumors showed a trend towards favorable overall survival (P = .085) but not disease-free survival (P = .238), suggesting that PIK3CA gene status may be a favorable predictive marker in ESCC patients. 
ABO and Rh blood group systems are the most important blood grouping systems from clinical aspect. Determination of blood group is important for blood transfusion therapy, medico-legal purposes, organ transplantation, settlement of paternity disputes etc.
MTHFD1 1958G>A, a polymorphism in folate metabolism, increases risk of pregnancy complications. A mouse model exhibited developmental defects, increased weight and decreased leukocyte counts. To examine the latter associations, we genotyped 651 women from a premature birth cohort. Prematurity and 1958G>A were not associated. Increases in the inflammatory marker CRP (logistic regression, p = 0.055) and BMI (chi-square, p = 0.0113) were associated with AA genotype in women with low folate. MTHFD1 1958G>A may influence immune function and obesity.
ABO blood group incompatibility between donor and recipient has been associated with poor transplant outcomes in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, its effect on the outcome of cord blood transplantation (CBT) has yet to be clarified. We retrospectively analyzed 191 adult patients who received single-unit CBT after myeloablative conditioning for malignant disease in our institute. Major mismatch showed a significantly lower incidence of platelet engraftment compared with ABO match as a reference (hazard ratio, .57; P = .01). Nevertheless, there was no increase in graft-versus-host disease, transplant-related mortality, and overall mortality after ABO-incompatible CBT. These data suggested that donor-recipient ABO incompatibility does not have a significant impact on outcome after myeloablative CBT for hematological malignancies.
ABO incompatibility is the commonest reason for rejection of donors in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). The donor pool could be expanded by 25 % to 35 % if the ABO barrier is overcome. In the absence of pre-conditioning, transplantation across the blood groups is fraught with the almost universal risk of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) that rapidly leads to graft loss. However, AMR can be prevented by removal of preformed antibodies and reducing their production by B cells. We describe our initial experience of three cases of ABO-incompatible (ABO-i) LDLT: a 42-year-old male, an 8-month-old male and a 28-month-old female, all of blood group O+ who received blood group B + right lobe, B + left lateral segment, and A + left lateral segment liver grafts, respectively. Pre-LDLT conditioning included administration of anti-CD20 antibody (Rituximab(®)) to the adult 4 weeks prior, and four to seven sessions of double-filtration plasmapheresis to all, to remove preformed antibodies and achieve anti-donor blood group antibody (ADA) titers of ≤ 1:16 IgG and ≤ 1:8 IgM, respectively. In addition, cases 1 and 3 received mycophenolate mofetil for 7 days prior to LDLT. After LDLT, all three patients achieved normal graft function over 8-17 days with no evidence of AMR and without the need for further plasmapheresis. Postoperative complications included portal vein thrombosis (one successfully re-explored), CMV (one), Pseudomonas and Klebsiella sepsis (one each), and abdominal collection (one treated with percutaneous drainage). All are currently well with normal graft function and low ADA titers at 8, 16, and 19 months after ABO-i LDLT.
RBP2 has been found to actively participate in cancer progression. It inhibits the senescence of cancer cells, mediates cancer cell proliferation and promotes cancer metastasis. It is also essential to drug tolerance. However, the effects of RBP2 on epithelial-mesenchymal transition are still unknown. In this study, we analyzed the effects of RBP2 on epithelial-mesenchymal transition in non-small cell lung cancer. The results showed that RBP2 down-regulated the expression of E-cadherin by inhibiting the promoter activity of E-cadherin and up-regulated the expression of N-cadherin and snail via the activation of Akt signaling, and the overexpression of RBP2 induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Our study further indicated that RBP2 may be a potential target for anti-lung cancer therapy.
CLC transporters catalyze transmembrane exchange of chloride for protons. Although a putative pathway for Cl(-) has been established, the pathway of H(+) translocation remains obscure. Through a highly concerted computational and experimental approach, we characterize microscopic details essential to understanding H(+)-translocation. An extended (0.4 µs) equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation of membrane-embedded, dimeric ClC-ec1, a CLC from Escherichia coli, reveals transient but frequent hydration of the central hydrophobic region by water molecules from the intracellular bulk phase via the interface between the two subunits. We characterize a portal region lined by E202, E203, and A404 as the main gateway for hydration. Supporting this mechanism, site-specific mutagenesis experiments show that ClC-ec1 ion transport rates decrease as the size of the portal residue at position 404 is increased. Beyond the portal, water wires form spontaneously and repeatedly to span the 15-Å hydrophobic region between the two known H(+) transport sites [E148 (Glu(ex)) and E203 (Glu(in))]. Our finding that the formation of these water wires requires the presence of Cl(-) explains the previously mystifying fact that Cl(-) occupancy correlates with the ability to transport protons. To further validate the idea that these water wires are central to the H(+) transport mechanism, we identified I109 as the residue that exhibits the greatest conformational coupling to water wire formation and experimentally tested the effects of mutating this residue. The results, by providing a detailed microscopic view of the dynamics of water wire formation and confirming the involvement of specific protein residues, offer a mechanism for the coupled transport of H(+) and Cl(-) ions in CLC transporters.
CYP2A6 metabolizes clinically relevant drugs, including antiretroviral and antimalarial drugs of major public health importance for the African populations. CYP2A6 genotype-phenotype relationship in African populations, and implications of geographic differences on enzyme activity, remain to be investigated. We evaluated the influence of CYP2A6 genotype, geographical differences, gender, and cigarette smoking on enzyme activity, using caffeine as a probe in 100 healthy unrelated Ethiopians living in Ethiopia, and 72 living in Sweden. CYP2A6 phenotype was estimated by urinary 1,7-dimethyluric acid (17U)/1,7-dimethylxanthine or paraxanthine (17X) ratio. The frequencies of CYP2A6*1B, *1D, *2, *4, *9, and *1x2 in Ethiopians were 31.3, 29.4, 0.6, 0.6, 2.8, and 0.3%, respectively. The overall mean±SD for log 17U/17X was 0.12±0.24 and coefficient of variation 199%. No significant difference in the mean log 17U/17X ratio between Ethiopians living in Sweden versus Ethiopia was observed. Analysis of variance revealed CYP2A6 genotype (p=0.04, F=2.01) but not geographical differences, sex, or cigarette smoking as predictors of CYP2A6 activity. Importantly, the median (interquartile range) of 17U/17X ratio in Ethiopians 1.35 (0.99 to 1.84) was 3- and 11-fold higher than the previously reported value in Swedes 0.52 (0.27 to 1.00) and Koreans 0.13 (0.0 to 0.35), respectively (Djordjevic et al., 2013). Taken together, we report here the relevance of CYP2A6 genotype for enzyme activity in this Ethiopian sample, as well as high CYP2A6 activity and unique distribution of the CYP2A6 variant alleles in Ethiopians as compared other populations described hitherto. Because Omics biomarker research is rapidly accelerating in Africa, CYP2A6 pharmacogenetics and clinical pharmacology observations reported herein for the Ethiopian populations have clinical and biological importance to plan for future rational therapeutics efforts in the African continent as well as therapeutics as a global science.
NQO1 (NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase, also known as DT-diaphorase) plays a prominent role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. NQO1 is abnormally elevated in many solid cancer types, including those of the adrenal gland, breast, colon, lung, ovary, and thyroid. However, little is known about the status of NQO1 in gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC). To investigate the clinicopathological significance of NQO1 expression in GAC, and thus evaluate its role as a potential prognostic marker, 203 cases of primary GAC, 31 of gastric dysplasia, and 53 of adjacent non-tumor tissues were selected for immunohistochemical staining of NQO1 protein. Correlations between NQO1 overexpression and clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated by χ(2) test and Fisher's exact test, while survival rates were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. The relationship between prognostic factors and patient survival was analyzed by Cox proportional hazards model. Through these analyses it was found that the strongly positive rate of NQO1 protein in GAC was significantly higher than that in gastric dysplasia and adjacent non-tumor tissues. Analysis by qRT-PCR also confirmed that NQO1 mRNA levels were increased in GAC compared with those detected in either adjacent non-tumor tissues or normal gastric mucosa. Additionally, the NQO1 expression rate was positively correlated with tumor size, serosal invasion, tumor stage, and both disease-free survival and 5-year survival rates. Further analysis showed that although NQO1 was not an independent predictor of GAC, elevated expression of NQO1 could predict lower disease-free survival and 5-year survival times in late-stage patients. In conclusion, NQO1 plays an important role in the progression of GAC, and might be a potential, but not an independent, poor prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of GAC. 
ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G, member 2) is a plasma membrane glycoprotein that actively extrudes xenobiotics and endobiotics from the cells and causes multidrug resistance in cancer. In the liver, ABCG2 is expressed in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes and excretes its substrates into the bile. ABCG2 is known to require high membrane cholesterol content for maximal activity, and by examining purified ABCG2 reconstituted in proteoliposomes we have recently shown that cholesterol is an essential activator, while bile acids significantly modify the activity of this protein. In the present work, by using isolated insect cell membrane preparations expressing human ABCG2 and its mutant variants, we have analyzed whether certain regions in this protein are involved in sterol recognition. We found that replacing ABCG2-R482 with large amino acids does not affect cholesterol dependence, but changes to small amino acids cause altered cholesterol sensitivity. When leucines in the potential steroid-binding element (SBE, aa 555-558) of ABCG2 were replaced by alanines, cholesterol dependence of ABCG2 activity was strongly reduced, although the L558A mutant variant when purified and reconstituted still required cholesterol for full activity. Regarding the effect of bile acids in isolated membranes, we found that these compounds decreased ABCG2-ATPase in the absence of drug substrates, which did not significantly affect substrate-stimulated ATPase activity. These ABCG2 mutant variants also altered bile acid sensitivity, although cholic acid and glycocholate were not transported by the protein. We suggest that the aforementioned two regions in ABCG2 are important for sterol sensing and may represent potential targets for pharmacologic modulation of ABCG2 function. 
ABO glycosyltransferases catalyze antigen modifications on various glycans and glycoproteins and determine the ABO blood types. Blood type A has been associated with increased risk of vascular diseases and differential circulating levels of proteins related to inflammation and endothelial function. The objective of this study was to determine the association of ABO blood types with ARDS risk in patients with major trauma and severe sepsis.
CD36 antibody (Ab) causes several disorders: neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, platelet transfusion refractoriness and non-haemolytic transfusion reactions. However, there is no gold-standard test for CD36 Ab.
SLC11A1 (solute carrier family 11 member 1 protein) gene influences the initial phase of bacterial cellular infections through macrophage activation. Recent literature on buffalo has attempted to associate the genotype of the polymorphic microsatellite located in the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of the gene, with either susceptibility to brucellosis or with improved macrophage function. Carriers of the (GT)16 allele have been reported to be resistant to brucellosis. In this study we analyzed the steady-state level of SLC11A1 expression in a serologically negative herd of 26 animals differing by the number of (GT)n microsatellite repeats by using a reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction approach. We evaluated five different reference genes, which had not been reported previously, for use in gene expression experiments in buffalo blood. However, we did not find any significant difference between buffalo carriers of the different microsatellite alleles, with respect to SLC11A1 expression in whole blood or in blood fractions [peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes/granulocytes (PMN/G)]. Conversely, there was a difference between the blood fractions in their SLC11A1 expression levels, with the PMN/G fraction having a higher expression level than the PBMC fraction (P < 0.015). 
ITPKB phosphorylates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate into inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and controls signal transduction in various hematopoietic cells. Surprisingly, it has been reported that the ITPKB messenger RNA level is significantly increased in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease, compared with control subjects. As extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation is increased in the Alzheimer brain and as ITPKB is a regulator of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation in some hematopoietic cells, we tested whether this increased activation in Alzheimer's disease might be related to an increased activity of ITPKB. We show here that ITPKB protein level was increased 3-fold in the cerebral cortex of most patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with control subjects, and accumulated in dystrophic neurites associated to amyloid plaques. In mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, Itpkb overexpression was associated with increased cell apoptosis and increased β-secretase 1 activity leading to overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. In this cellular model, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase kinases 1/2 completely prevented overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation. However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and β-secretase 1 activity, resulting in exacerbated Alzheimer's disease pathology as shown by increased astrogliosis, amyloid-β40 peptide production and tau hyperphosphorylation. No impact on pathology was observed in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model when a catalytically inactive ITPKB protein was overexpressed. Together, our results point to the ITPKB/inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate/extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 signalling pathway as an important regulator of neuronal cell apoptosis, APP processing and tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease, and suggest that ITPKB could represent a new target for reducing pathology in human patients with Alzheimer's disease with ITPKB expression. 
IDO2 is implicated in tryptophan catabolism and immunity but its physiological functions are not well established. Here we report the characterization of mice genetically deficient in IDO2, which develop normally but exhibit defects in IDO-mediated T-cell regulation and inflammatory responses. Construction of this strain was prompted in part by our discovery that IDO2 function is attenuated in macrophages from Ido1 (-/-) mice due to altered message splicing, generating a functional mosaic with implications for interpreting findings in Ido1 (-/-) mice. No apparent defects were observed in Ido2 (-/-) mice in embryonic development or hematopoietic differentiation, with wild-type profiles documented for kynurenine in blood serum and for immune cells in spleen, lymph nodes, peritoneum, thymus and bone marrow of naive mice. In contrast, upon immune stimulation we determined that IDO1-dependent T regulatory cell generation was defective in Ido2 (-/-) mice, supporting Ido1-Ido2 genetic interaction and establishing a functional role for Ido2 in immune modulation. Pathophysiologically, both Ido1 (-/-) and Ido2 (-/-) mice displayed reduced skin contact hypersensitivity responses, but mechanistic distinctions were apparent, with only Ido2 deficiency associated with a suppression of immune regulatory cytokines that included GM-CSF, G-CSF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6 and MCP-1/CCL2. Different contributions to inflammation were likewise indicated by the finding that Ido2 (-/-) mice did not phenocopy Ido1 (-/-) mice in the reduced susceptibility of the latter to inflammatory skin cancer. Taken together, our results offer an initial glimpse into immune modulation by IDO2, revealing its genetic interaction with IDO1 and distinguishing its non-redundant contributions to inflammation. 
SRD5A3 is responsible for SRD5A3-CDG, a type of congenital disorder of glycosylation, and mutations have been reported in 15 children. All the mutations are recessive and truncating.
ABO blood type is an inherited trait associated with coagulation factor levels and vascular outcomes.
CYP2D6 is a critical enzyme in the metabolism of tamoxifen and potentially a key determinant in breast cancer outcomes. Our study examined patients' beliefs about how the CYP2D6 genotype would affect their prognoses.
PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS) is an autosomal-dominant genetic condition underlying a subset of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with macrocephaly. Caused by germline mutations in PTEN, PHTS also causes increased risks of multiple cancers via dysregulation of the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways. Conditional knockout models have shown that neural Pten regulates social behavior, proliferation and cell size. Although much is known about how the intracellular localization of PTEN regulates signaling in cancer cell lines, we know little of how PTEN localization influences normal brain physiology and behavior. To address this, we generated a germline knock-in mouse model of cytoplasm-predominant Pten and characterized its behavioral and cellular phenotypes. The homozygous Pten(m3m4) mice have decreased total Pten levels including a specific drop in nuclear Pten and exhibit region-specific increases in brain weight. The Pten(m3m4) model displays sex-specific increases in social motivation, poor balance and normal recognition memory-a profile reminiscent of some individuals with high functioning ASD. The cytoplasm-predominant protein caused cellular hypertrophy limited to the soma and led to increased NG2 cell proliferation and accumulation of glia. The animals also exhibit significant astrogliosis and microglial activation, indicating a neuroinflammatory phenotype. At the signaling level, Pten(m3m4) mice show brain region-specific differences in Akt activation. These results demonstrate that differing alterations to the same autism-linked gene can cause distinct behavioral profiles. The Pten(m3m4) model is the first murine model of inappropriately elevated social motivation in the context of normal cognition and may expand the range of autism-related behaviors replicated in animal models.
ABO blood group antigen (ABGA) secretion into the saliva and other body fluids is a well-known phenomenon, and there is evidence to suggest a link between secretor status and the appearance of caries. It has been proposed that secretion of these antigens into the saliva might be caries-preventive, however, this proposition is still a matter of debate. Our aim was to examine the relationship between caries experience and secretor status in a group of Hungarian children and adolescents in a cross-sectional study. Altogether 130 children and adolescents participated in the study (aged 6-18 years). Participants were divided into two groups according to dentition (i.e. mixed and permanent). ABGA were determined from saliva. The DMF-T and dmf-t (decayed, missing, and filled) indices were calculated, as well as the oral health hygiene index-simplified plaque index. Association of these indices with secretor status was examined. In mixed dentition, the mean dmf-t values were significantly lower in the secretor group (2.1 ± 0.52 SEM), as compared to the nonsecretor group (3.8 ± 0.93 SEM; p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). The finding that children of mixed dentition are apparently better protected against caries suggests that the assumed protective effect might be associated with deciduous teeth, but given the general paucity of knowledge about this topic, further research is indicated.
G6PD enzyme deficiency is one of the most prevalent genetic disorders worldwide and it has high incidence rate in Northern provinces of Iran. It was observed that national neonatal screening for G6PD enzyme deficiency fails to detect all affected infants. In order to clarify the cause, this study has been done in Thalassemia Research Center, Sari, Iran.
CYP17A1 catalyzes the 17-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase reactions, regulating the steroid hormones produced by the adrenal glands and gonads. Mutations that compromise all CYP17A1 activities are extremely rare and cause combined 17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency. Clinically, combined 17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency presents with hypertension, hypokalemia, primary amenorrhea, and sexual infantilism. A few mutations selectively impair 17,20-lyase activity, and some mutations in cofactor proteins cytochrome P450-oxidoreductase and cytochrome b5 also selectively disrupt 17,20-lyase activity. The defect in sex steroid synthesis impairs fertility in both male and female patients when the deficiency is severe. This paper reviews the genetics, steroidogenesis, and fertility impairments associated with these disorders. 
GNE Myopathy is a rare recessively inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the GNE gene, which codes for the key enzyme in the metabolic pathway of sialic acid synthesis. The process by which GNE mutations lead to myopathy is not well understood. By in situ hybridization and gne promoter-driven fluorescent transgenic fish generation, we have characterized the spatiotemporal expression pattern of the zebrafish gne gene and have shown that it is highly conserved compared with the human ortholog. We also show the deposition of maternal gne mRNA and maternal GNE protein at the earliest embryonic stage, emphasizing the critical role of gne in embryonic development. Injection of morpholino (MO)-modified antisense oligonucleotides specifically designed to knockdown gne, into one-cell embryos lead to a variety of phenotypic severity. Characterization of the gne knockdown morphants showed a significantly reduced locomotor activity as well as distorted muscle integrity, including a reduction in the number of muscle myofibers, even in mild or intermediate phenotype morphants. These findings were further confirmed by electron microscopy studies, where large gaps between sarcolemmas were visualized, although normal sarcomeric structures were maintained. These results demonstrate a critical novel role for gne in embryonic development and particularly in myofiber development, muscle integrity and activity. 
ABO blood type is an inherited characteristic that has been associated with the prognosis of several malignancies, but there is little evidence in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of ABO blood type on mortality in patients with UCB treated with radical cystectomy (RC).
CAD is a large multifunctional polypeptide that initiates and controls the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines in animals. In this issue of Structure, Grande-García and colleagues provide the first atomic information of this antitumoral target by reporting the crystal structure of the dihydroorotase domain of human CAD. 
PRDX6 is a bifunctional protein with both glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) activities, which are concomitantly increased with the expression of PRDX6. PRDX6 promoted lung tumor growth in an in vivo allograft model. Herein, we further studied the vital roles in tumor progression of PRDX6 in lung cancer using nude mice bearing PRDX6-overexpressing lung cancer cells. Nude mice xenografted with PRDX6 showed increases in tumor size and weight compared to control mice. Histopathological and Western blotting examination demonstrated that expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, vascular endothelial growth factor, metalloproteinases 2 and 9, and cyclin-dependent kinases accompanied by increased iPLA2 and GPx activities were increased in the tumor tissues of PRDX6-overexpressing nude mice. In tumor tissues of PRDX6-overexpressing mice, the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and AP-1 DNA binding were also increased. The growth of lung cancer cell lines (A549 and NCI-H460) was enhanced by the increase in iPLA2 and GPx activities of PRDX6. In addition, mutant PRDX6 (C47S) attenuated PRDX6-mediated p38, ERK1/2, and AP-1 activities as well as its enzyme activities in the A549 and NCI-H460 lines. Furthermore, tumor growth and p38, ERK1/2, and AP-1 activities were also inhibited in nude mice bearing mutant PRDX6 (C47S) compared to PRDX6. Therefore, our findings indicate that PRDX6 promotes lung tumor growth via increased glutathione peroxidase and iPLA2 activities. 
ABO blood groups have been suggested to contribute to the development of certain tumors; however, the associations between ABO blood groups and the incidence and metastases of cutaneous malignant melanomas have not been fully evaluated in Chinese populations. Thus, we investigated these associations with a case-controlled study in northeast of China.
DDC (3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine)-fed mice are widely used as a model for cholestatic liver disease. We examined the expression of tight junction protein claudin subspecies by immunofluorescent histochemistry in small intestine and kidney tissues of mice fed a DDC diet for 12 weeks. In the small intestine, decreases in claudin-3, claudin-7 and claudin-15 were observed in villous epithelial cells corresponding to the severity of histological changes while leaving the abundance of these claudin subspecies unchanged in crypt cells. Nevertheless, the proliferative activity of intestinal crypt cells measured by immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 decreased in the mice fed the DDC diet compared with that of control mice. These results suggest the possibility that DDC feeding affects the barrier function of villous epithelial cells and thus inhibits the proliferative activity of crypt epithelial cells. On the other hand, in the kidney, remarkable changes were found in the subcellular localization of claudin subspecies in a segment-specific manner, although histological changes of renal epithelial cells were quite minimal. These results indicate that immunohistochemistry for claudin subspecies can serve as a useful tool for detecting minute functional alterations of intestinal and renal epithelial cells. 
ABO discrepancy refers to incongruence between the results of red cell and serum groupings. One such case is described here; the discrepant results of whose routine ABO grouping led to the diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency. There was no reaction in the reverse grouping of a young patient presenting with recurrent bacterial infections, pointing towards an absence of antibodies in the serum. Diagnosis was made on the basis of markedly decreased serum immunoglobulin levels and by serum protein electrophoresis showing scanty gamma regions. 
PIK3CA gene encoding a catalytic subunit of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is mutated and/or amplified in various neoplasia, including lung cancer. Here we investigated PIK3CA gene alterations, the expression of core components of PI3K pathway, and evaluated their clinical importance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
MTHFR mediates the one carbon metabolism pathway. Two common genetic variants, C677T and A1298C, of MTHFR are associated with number of human diseases, including cancer, as well as being involved in the modulation of therapy outcome to antifolate drugs. To understand the distribution pattern of SNPs among different tissues of an individual, we examined MTHFR polymorphisms in normal and colon cancer tissues and compared the genotype frequencies in peripheral blood samples.
CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette family of membrane proteins. Although almost all members of this family are transporters, CFTR functions as a channel with specificity for anions, in particular chloride and bicarbonate. In this review we look at what is known about CFTR structure and function within the context of the ATP-binding cassette family. We also review current strategies aimed at obtaining the high resolution structure of the protein.
SETDB1 has been established as an oncogene in a number of human carcinomas. The present study was to evaluate the expression of SETDB1 in prostate cancer (PCa) tissues and cells and to preliminarily investigate the role of SETDB1 in prostate tumorigenesis in vitro. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to detect the expression of SETDB1 in PCa tissues, adjacent normal tissues, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues, PCa cell lines and normal prostate epithelial cells. The results suggested that SETDB1 was upregulated in human PCa tissues compared with normal tissues at the mRNA and protein levels. The role of SETDB1 in proliferation was analyzed with cell counting kit-8, colony-forming efficiency and flow cytometry assays. The results indicated that downregulation of SETDB1 by siRNA inhibited PCa cell growth, and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. The PCa cell migration and invasion decreased by silcencing SETDB1 which were assessed by using in vitro scratch and transwell invasion assay respectively. Our data suggested that SETDB1 is overexpressed in human PCa. Silencing SETDB1 inhibited PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
IDH1 mutational status probably plays an important role in the predictive response for patients with astroglioma. This study explores whether DTI metrics are able to noninvasively detect IDH1 status in astrogliomas.
CYP2E1 has been implicated in the bioactivation of many small molecules into reactive metabolites which form adducts with proteins and DNA, and thus a better understanding of the molecular determinants of its selectivity are critical for accurate toxicological predictions. In this study, we determined the potency of inhibition of human CYP2E1 for various 4-carbon alkanes, alkenes and alcohols. In addition, known CYP2E1 substrates and inhibitors including 4-methylpyrazole, aniline, and dimethylnitrosamine were included to determine their relative potencies. Of the 1,3-butadiene-derived metabolites studied, 3,4-epoxy-1-butene was the strongest inhibitor with an IC50 of 110 μM compared to 1700 μM and 6600 μM for 1,2-butenediol and 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane, respectively. Compared to known inhibitors, inhibitory potency of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene is between 4-methylpyrazole (IC50 = 1.8 μM) and dimethylnitrosamine (IC50 = 230 μM). All three butadiene metabolites inhibit CYP2E1 activity through a simple competitive mechanism. Among the 4-carbon compounds studied, the presence and location of polar groups seems to influence inhibitory potency. To further examine this notion, the investigation was extended to include structurally and chemically similar analogues, including propylene oxide and various butane alcohols. Those results demonstrated preferential recognition of CYP2E1 toward the type and location of polar and hydrophobic structural elements. Taken together, CYP2E1 metabolism may be modified in vivo by exposure to 4-carbon compounds, such as drugs, and nutritional constituents, a finding that highlights the complexity of exposure to mixtures.
SLC26A4 mutations can cause a distinctive hearing loss phenotype with sudden drops and fluctuation in patients. Existing Slc26a4 mutant mouse lines have a profound loss of hearing and vestibular function, with severe inner ear malformations that do not model this human phenotype. In this study, we generated Slc26a4-insufficient mice by manipulation of doxycycline administration to a transgenic mouse line in which all Slc26a4 expression was under the control of doxycycline. Doxycycline was administered from conception to embryonic day 17.5, and then it was discontinued. Auditory brainstem response thresholds showed significant fluctuation of hearing loss from 1 through 3months of age. The endocochlear potential, which is required for inner ear sensory cell function, correlated with auditory brainstem response thresholds. We observed degeneration of stria vascularis intermediate cells, the cells that generate the endocochlear potential, but no other abnormalities within the cochlea. We conclude that fluctuations of hearing result from fluctuations of the endocochlear potential and stria vascularis dysfunction in Slc26a4-insufficient mouse ears. This model can now be used to test potential interventions to reduce or prevent sudden hearing loss or fluctuation in human patients. Our strategy to generate a hypomorphic mouse model utilizing the tet-on system will be applicable to other diseases in which a hypomorphic allele is needed to model the human phenotype. 
LPIN2 is one of the members of the Lipin family, which acts as a phosphatidate phosphatase enzyme. In this study, we identified the cDNA sequence and exonic variants of chicken LPIN2, and evaluated its spatio-temporal expression patterns. It indicated that chicken LPIN2 cDNA contained a 2,664-bp open reading frame flanked by a 176-bp 5' untranslated region and a 429-bp 3' untranslated region, predicted encoding one protein of 886 amino acids. Fourteen variants (three missense mutations) were detected from the coding region of chicken LPIN2. W265L was predicted to affect the gene function (p < 0.01) and eight synonymous mutations were predicted to affect the binding sites of SR proteins, which suggested the important functions of these variants. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that LPIN2 in two genotypic chickens (LD and HB chickens, with difference in growth rate) presented similar tissue expression patterns, which was liver and ovary enriched with low abundance in skeleton muscles. Chicken LPIN2 exhibited tissue-specific temporal-expression patterns during postnatal development (0-16 weeks). Chicken cutaneous LPIN2 was in steady-state mRNA levels during postnatal development; chicken LPIN2 mRNA in pectoralis major had a prominent level at 0 week-old, then dropped dramatically at 4 week-old and maintained a relatively low level through 4-16 weeks; while chicken hepatic LPIN2 had a relatively high expression at 0 week-old, with a relatively low level through 4-12 weeks and a slight increase at 16 week-old. The studies about the basic gene features of chicken LPIN2 would lay the foundation for further exploring its biological function.
ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) plays a critical role in the local tissue RAS (renin-angiotensin system) by hydrolysing the potent hypertensive and mitogenic peptide AngII (angiotensin II). Changes in the levels of ACE2 have been observed in a number of pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, but little is known of the mechanisms regulating its expression. In the present study, therefore, the potential role of miRNAs in the regulation of ACE2 expression in primary human cardiac myofibroblasts was examined. Putative miRNA-binding sites were identified in the 3'-UTR of the ACE2 transcript using online prediction algorithms. Two of these, miR-200b and miR-421, were selected for further analysis. A reporter system using the 3'-UTR of ACE2 fused to the coding region of firefly luciferase was used to determine the functionality of the identified binding sites in vitro. This identified miR-421, but not miR-200b, as a potential regulator of ACE2. The ability of miR-421, an miRNA implicated in the development of thrombosis, to down-regulate ACE2 expression was subsequently confirmed by Western blot analysis of both primary cardiac myofibroblasts and transformed cells transfected with a synthetic miR-421 precursor. Real-time PCR analysis of miR-421 revealed widespread expression in human tissues. miR-421 levels in cardiac myofibroblasts showed significant inter-patient variability, in keeping with the variability of ACE2 expression we have observed previously. In conclusion, the present study is the first to demonstrate that ACE2 may be subject to post-transcriptional regulation and reveals a novel potential therapeutic target, miR-421, which could be exploited to modulate ACE2 expression in disease. 
ABCA4 is a member of the A subfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters that consists of large integral membrane proteins implicated in inherited human diseases. ABCA4 assists in the clearance of N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine, a potentially toxic by-product of the visual cycle formed in photoreceptor cells during light perception. Structural and functional studies of this protein have been hindered by its large size, membrane association, and domain complexity. Although mammalian, insect and bacterial systems have been used for expression of ABCA4 and its individual domains, the structural relevance of resulting proteins to the native transporter has yet to be established. We produced soluble domains of ABCA4 in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the full-length transporter in HEK293 cells. Electron microscopy and size exclusion chromatography were used to assess the conformational homogeneity and structure of these proteins. We found that isolated ABCA4 domains formed large, heterogeneous oligomers cross-linked with non-specific disulphide bonds. Incomplete folding of cytoplasmic domain 2 was proposed based on fluorescence spectroscopy results. In contrast, full-length human ABCA4 produced in mammalian cells was found structurally equivalent to the native protein obtained from bovine photoreceptors. These findings offer recombinantly expressed full-length ABCA4 as an appropriate object for future detailed structural and functional characterization. 
SLC25A13 analysis has provided reliable evidences for the definitive diagnosis of citrin deficiency (CD) in the past decade. Meanwhile, these studies generated some issues yet to be resolved, including the pathogenicity of SLC25A13 missense mutations and the mRNA product from the mutation c.615+5G>A. This study aims to investigate the effect of a novel missense mutation on the aspartate/glutamate carrier (AGC) function of citrin protein, and to explore the aberrant transcript from c.615+5G>A in the same CD infant.
ADA is widely distributed in human tissues, which may contribute to the maturation of the immunological system, especially the proliferation and differentiation of lymphoid cells, and seems to be critical at different stages of the maturation process. The activity of ADA changes in diseases characterized by the alteration of cell-mediated immunity. In this study we examined changes in serum total ADA activity and the patterns of two ADA isoenzymes, ADA-1 and ADA-2, in healthy pregnant women, and evaluated the possible role of the alteration of cell-mediated immunity during pregnancy as causes of changes in ADA activity.
CYP3A4 metabolizes more than 50% of the drugs on the market. The large inter-individual differences of CYP3A4 expression may contribute to the variability of human drug responses. Post-transcriptional regulation of CYP3A4 is poorly understood, whereas transcriptional regulation has been studied much more thoroughly. In this study, we used multiple software programs to predict miRNAs that might bind to CYP3A4 and identified 112 potentially functional miRNAs. Then a luciferase reporter system was used to assess the effect of the overexpression of each potentially functional miRNA in HEK 293T cells. Fourteen miRNAs that significantly decreased reporter activity were measured in human liver samples (N = 27) as candidate miRNAs. To establish a more effective way to analyze in vivo data for miRNA candidates, the relationship between functional miRNA and target mRNA was modeled mathematically. Taking advantage of this model, we found that hsa-miR-577, hsa-miR-1, hsa-miR-532-3p and hsa-miR-627 could significantly downregulate the translation efficiency of CYP3A4 mRNA in liver. This study used in silico, in vitro and in vivo methods to progressively screen functional miRNAs for CYP3A4 and to enhance our understanding of molecular events underlying the large inter-individual differences of CYP3A4 expression in human populations. 
ABCC1 and ABCG2 are two transporters associated with multi-drug resistance to cancer chemotherapy. Ouabain is a cardiotonic steroid, currently considered as a hormone associated with arterial hypertension. Previous studies have suggested that ouabain can modulate ABCB1 and ABCC1 expression in cancer and renal cell lines. The present study investigated the effects of physiological concentrations of ouabain on the expression and activity of ABCC1 and ABCG2 in two human breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, the first known to be responsive to estrogens. Cell viability and proliferation assays showed that 1 μM ouabain reduced proliferation of MCF7, but not if MDA-MB-231 cells. On the other hand, 10 nM ouabain increased proliferation of MDA-MB-231, but not of MCF7 cells. Ouabain (10 nM) prevented the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in MCF7 cells, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. Treatment of cells under different ouabain concentrations for 24 h did not cause any significant effects in the expression of ABCG2 or ABCC1 in either cell line. However, the activity of ABCC1 was increased when MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 10 mM and 1 nM ouabain respectively. These results claim attention to the possibility that breast cancer patients with high levels of endogenous ouabain may have different responses to chemotherapy. 
PIK3CA is probably the most commonly mutated kinase in several malignant tumors. Activation of class I phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K) regulates tumor proliferation, survival, etc. This study sought to identify whether the pan-inhibitor has more antitumor efficacy in breast cancer cells with PIK3CA Mutation or HER2 amplification than basal-like cancer cells. The proliferation of breast cancer cells was measured by MTT assay in the presence of GDC-0941. Afterwards, we determined the visible changes in signaling in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Finally, we examined GDC-0941 effects on cell cycle, apoptosis and motility. GDC-0941 exhibited excellent inhibition on three cell lines with PIK3CA mutation or HER2 amplification. In addition, GDC-0941 resulted in decreased Akt activity. GDC-0941 downregulated the key components of the cell cycle machinery, such as cyclin D1, upregulated the apoptotic markers and inhibited cell motility on three cell lines with PIK3CA Mutation or HER2 amplification. Antitumor activity of GDC-0941 treatment amongst tumor cell lines with PIK3CA mutation and HER2 amplification may have clinical utility in patients with these oncogenic alterations.
FABP1 has been reported to possess strong antioxidant properties. Upon successful transfection of the Chang cell line, which has undetectable FABP1 mRNA levels, with human FABP1 cDNA, the Chang cells were shown to express FABP1. Using the transfected and control (normal) Chang cells and subjecting them to oxidative stress, transfected cells were reported to be associated with enhanced cell viability. This study extends those observations by investigating the effect of FABP1 on acetaminophen (AAP)-induced hepatotoxicity. We hypothesized that presence of FABP1 would enhance cell viability compared to control cells (vector transfected cells).
NPC1 gene is an important gene closely related to the Niemann-Pick type C (NPC). Mutations in the NPC1 gene tend to cause Niemann-Pick type C, a lysosomal storage disorder. Previous studies have shown that NPC1 protein plays an important role in subcellular lipid transport, homeostasis, platelet function and formation, which are basic metabolic activities in the process of development. In this study, to explore the association between the NPC1 gene variation and body size traits in Qinchuan cattle, we detected four novel coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) in the bovine NPC1 gene, including one missense mutation (SNP1) and three synonymous mutations (SNP2, SNP3 and SNP4). Population genetic analyses of 518 individuals and association correlations between cSNPs and bovine body size traits were conducted in this research. A missense mutation at SNP1 locus was found to be significantly related to the heart girth, hip width and body weight (P<0.01 or P<0.05, 3.5-year-old). Two synonymous mutations at SNP2 and SNP3 loci also showed significant effects on hip width (P<0.05, 3.5-year-old). One synonymous mutation at SNP4 locus showed significant effect on body weight (P<0.05, 2.0-year-old). Combined haplotypes H2H6 and H6H6 showed significant effects on body size traits such as heart girth, hip width, and body weight (3.5-year-old, P<0.01 or P<0.05). This study provides evidence that the NPC1 gene might be involved in the regulation of bovine growth and body development, and may be considered as a candidate gene for marker assisted selection (MAS) in beef cattle breeding industry.
CYP2D6 metabolizes many centrally acting drugs, neurotoxins and endogenous neurochemicals, and differences in brain levels of CYP2D have been associated with brain function and drug response. Alcohol consumers and smokers have higher levels of CYP2D6 in brain, but not liver, suggesting ethanol and/or nicotine may induce human brain CYP2D6. We investigated the independent and combined effects of chronic ethanol self-administration and nicotine treatment on CYP2D expression in African green monkeys.
MTMR14 is a phosphoinositide phosphatase, which has been reported to regulate the maintenance of normal muscle performance and aging in mice. However, the function of MTMR14 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) remains largely unknown. In this study, we established MTMR14 WT and KO MEFs and showed that MTMR14 is localized in whole MEFs, with higher level in nucleus and lower in cytoplasm, partially overlapping with mitochondrial. Compared with the WT control, MTMR14 KO MEFs exhibit a higher proliferation rate and more obvious autophagy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KO of MTMR14 significantly decreased the mRNA levels of p21 and p27, while increased those of cyclinD and cyclinE. Upon (insulin-like growth factor) IGF stimulation, we also found KO of MTMR14 enhanced the phosphorylation levels of AKT and ERK in MEFs. Based on these findings, we propose that defect of MTMR14 promotes autophagy and cell proliferation in MEFs. 
PTEN inactivation is the most frequent genetic aberration in endometrial cancer. One of the phosphatase-independent roles of PTEN is associated with homologous recombination (HR) in nucleus. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) plays key roles in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks, and a PARP inhibitor induces synthetic lethality in cancer cells with HR deficiency. We examined the anti-tumor activity of olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, and its correlation between the sensitivity and status of PTEN in endometrial cancer cell lines.
CD38 encodes a ligand in the oxytocin signaling pathway. Some single nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with low serum oxytocin levels in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. Oxytocin disruption has been hypothesized to account for features of ASD, including impaired communication and social behavior, based on animal studies. Recent human studies have shown administration of oxytocin improving emotion recognition, promoting social behavior, and improving auditory processing of social stimuli in ASD patients. In addition to its role in oxytocin signaling, CD38 is involved in the regulation of calcium concentration in airway smooth muscle with impairment of CD38 being implicated in airway diseases like asthma. While a number of studies have implicated rare chromosomal deletions and duplications in helping determine genetic risk for autism, there are to our knowledge no reports describing rearrangements involving CD38 or deletions in patients with ASD. Here, we present two sisters diagnosed with autism and with features of regression-previously acquired speech lost in the second year of life. The younger sister, who also had asthma, inherited a maternal deletion of 4p15.32 that results in a BST1-CD38 fusion transcript. Their mother's deletion was mosaic and she was not affected. Although further work is required to assess functional consequences of the fusion transcript, we hypothesize that the proband's deletion may have served as a risk factor for autism that, when combined with other susceptibility variants, resulted in a more severe presentation than her sister.
ABO blood group and secretor status is valuable in relation to some diseases in clinical and forensic medicine. Across the globe there are geographic and racial differences in the frequency of secretors and non-secretors. Aim of this study was to evaluate the status of ABH blood group secretors and non-secretors in Karachi (Pakistan).
ABO incompatible kidney transplantation (ABOi-KT) was previously considered to be an absolute contraindication for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) due to hyperacute rejection related to blood type barrier. Since the first successful series of ABOi-KT was reported, ABOi-KT is performed increasingly all over the world. ABOi-KT has led to an expanded donor pool and reduced the number of patients with ESKD awaiting deceased kidney transplantation (KT). Intensified immunosuppression and immunological understanding has helped to shape current desensitization protocols. Consequently, in recent years, ABOi-KT outcome is comparable to ABO compatible KT (ABOc-KT). However, many questions still remain unanswered. In ABOi-KT, there is an additional residual immunological risk that may lead to allograft damage, despite using current diverse but usually intensified immunosuppressive protocols at the expense of increasing risk of infection and possibly malignancy. Notably, in ABOi-KT, desensitization and antibody reduction therapies have increased the cost of KT. Reassuringly, there has been an evolution in ABOi-KT leading to a simplification of protocols over the last decade. This review provides an overview of the history, outcome, protocol, advantages and disadvantages in ABOi-KT, and focuses on whether ABOi-KT should be recommended as a therapeutic option of KT in the future. 
CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is expressed by both neutrophils and platelets. Lack of functional CFTR could lead to severe lung infection and inflammation. Here, we found that mutation of CFTR (F508del) or inhibition of CFTR in mice led to more severe thrombocytopenia, alveolar neutrocytosis and bacteriosis, and lower lipoxin A4/MIP-2 (macrophage inhibitory protein-2) or lipoxin A4/neutrophil ratios in the BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) during acute E. coli pneumonia. In vitro, inhibition of CFTR promotes MIP-2 production in LPS-stimulated neutrophils; however, lipoxin A4 could dose-dependently suppress this effect. In LPS-induced acute lung inflammation, blockade of PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1) or P-selectin, antagonism of PAF by WEB2086, or correction of mutated CFTR trafficking by KM11060 could significantly increase plasma lipoxin A4 levels in F508del relevant to wildtype mice. Concurrently, F508del mice had higher plasma platelet activating factor (PAF) levels and PAF-AH activity compared to wildtype under LPS challenge. Inhibiting hydrolysis of PAF by a specific PAF-AH (PAF-acetylhydrolase) inhibitor, MAFP, could worsen LPS-induced lung inflammation in F508del mice compared to vehicle treated F508del group. Particularly, depletion of platelets in F508del mice could significantly decrease plasma lipoxin A4 and PAF-AH activity and deteriorate LPS-induced lung inflammation compared to control F508del mice. Taken together, lipoxin A4 and PAF are involved in E. coli or LPS-induced lung inflammation in CFTR-deficient mice, suggesting that lipoxin A4 and PAF might be therapeutic targets for ameliorating CFTR-deficiency deteriorated lung inflammation. 
AQP3 has been correlated with higher transport of glycerol, increment of ATP content, and larger proliferation capacity. Recently, we described the gold(III) complex Auphen as a very selective and potent inhibitor of AQP3's glycerol permeability (Pgly ). Here we evaluated Auphen effect on the proliferation of various mammalian cell lines differing in AQP3 expression level: no expression (PC12), moderate (NIH/3T3) or high (A431) endogenous expression, cells stably expressing AQP3 (PC12-AQP3), and human HEK293T cells transiently transfected (HEK-AQP3) for AQP3 expression. Proliferation was evaluated in the absence or presence of Auphen (5 μM) by counting number of viable cells and analyzing 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Auphen reduced ≈50% the proliferation in A431 and PC12-AQP3, ≈15% in HEK-AQP3 and had no effect in PC12-wt and NIH/3T3. Strong arrest in the S-G2/M phases of the cell cycle, supported by analysis of cyclins (A, B1, D1, E) levels, was observed in AQP3-expressing cells treated with Auphen. Flow-cytometry of propidium iodide incorporation and measurements of mitochondrial dehydrogenases activity confirmed absence of cytotoxic effect of the drug. Functional studies evidenced ≈50% inhibition of A431 Pgly by Auphen, showing that the compound's antiproliferative effect correlates with its ability to inhibit AQP3 Pgly . Role of Cys-40 on AQP3 permeability blockage by Auphen was confirmed by analyzing the mutated protein (AQP3-Ser-40). Accordingly, cells transfected with mutated AQP3 gained resistance to the antiproliferative effect of Auphen. These results highlight an Auphen inhibitory effect on proliferation of cells expressing AQP3 and suggest a targeted therapeutic effect on carcinomas with large AQP3 expression.
GSTM1 gene encodes a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, and its polymorphisms have been related to individual susceptibility to several malignancies. Many molecular epidemiological studies were performed to investigate the association between the GSTM1 null polymorphism and lung cancer susceptibility in East Asia. However, the results were inconsistent. In order to derive a more precise estimation, we conducted this meta-analysis involving 5,909 lung cancer cases and 7,067 controls from 35 studies. We used crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the association between GSTM1 null genotype and the risk of lung cancer. Our study found that the GSTM1 null genotype appeared to be a significant risk factor for lung cancer in East Asia population (OR = 1.30, 95 % CI = 1.17-1.45, P heterogeneity < 0.0001, and I (2) = 54.0 %).
CYP2D6 is a key enzyme in tamoxifen metabolism, transforming it into its main active metabolite, endoxifen. Poor CYP2D6 metabolizers (PM) have lower endoxifen plasma concentrations and possibly benefit less from treatment with tamoxifen. We evaluated tamoxifen dose adjustment in CYP2D6 PM patients in order to obtain plasma concentrations of endoxifen comparable to patients with extensive CYP2D6 metabolism (EM).
ALOX12 is a gene encoding arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), a member of a nonheme lipoxygenase family of dioxygenases. ALOX12 catalyzes the addition of oxygen to arachidonic acid, producing 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE), which can be reduced to the eicosanoid 12-HETE (12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid). 12-HETE acts in diverse cellular processes, including catecholamine synthesis, vasoconstriction, neuronal function, and inflammation. Consistent with effects on these fundamental mechanisms, allelic variants of ALOX12 are associated with diseases including schizophrenia, atherosclerosis, and cancers, but the mechanisms have not been defined. Toxoplasma gondii is an apicomplexan parasite that causes morbidity and mortality and stimulates an innate and adaptive immune inflammatory reaction. Recently, it has been shown that a gene region known as Toxo1 is critical for susceptibility or resistance to T. gondii infection in rats. An orthologous gene region with ALOX12 centromeric is also present in humans. Here we report that the human ALOX12 gene has susceptibility alleles for human congenital toxoplasmosis (rs6502997 [P, <0.000309], rs312462 [P, <0.028499], rs6502998 [P, <0.029794], and rs434473 [P, <0.038516]). A human monocytic cell line was genetically engineered using lentivirus RNA interference to knock down ALOX12. In ALOX12 knockdown cells, ALOX12 RNA expression decreased and levels of the ALOX12 substrate, arachidonic acid, increased. ALOX12 knockdown attenuated the progression of T. gondii infection and resulted in greater parasite burdens but decreased consequent late cell death of the human monocytic cell line. These findings suggest that ALOX12 influences host responses to T. gondii infection in human cells. ALOX12 has been shown in other studies to be important in numerous diseases. Here we demonstrate the critical role ALOX12 plays in T. gondii infection in humans. 
CD36 is a pleiotropic receptor involved in several pathophysiological conditions, including cerebral ischemia, neurovascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis, and recent reports implicate its involvement in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ERSR). We hypothesized that CD36 signaling contributes to the inflammation and microvascular dysfunction following spinal cord injury. Following contusive injury, CD36(-/-) mice demonstrated improved hindlimb functional recovery and greater white matter sparing than CD36(+/+) mice. CD36(-/-) mice exhibited a reduced macrophage, but not neutrophil, infiltration into the injury epicenter. Fewer infiltrating macrophages were either apoptotic or positive for the ERSR marker, phospho-ATF4. CD36(-/-) mice also exhibited significant improvements in injury heterodomain vascularity and function. These microvessels accumulated less of the oxidized lipid product 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (4HNE) and exhibited a reduced ERSR, as detected by vascular phospho-ATF4, CHOP and CHAC-1 expression. In cultured primary endothelial cells, deletion of CD36 diminished 4HNE-induced phospho-ATF4 and CHOP expression. A reduction in phospho-eIF2α and subsequent increase in KDEL-positive, ER-localized proteins suggest that 4HNE-CD36 signaling facilitates the detection of misfolded proteins upstream of eIF2α phosphorylation, ultimately leading to CHOP-induced apoptosis. We conclude that CD36 deletion modestly, but significantly, improves functional recovery from spinal cord injury by enhancing vascular function and reducing macrophage infiltration. These phenotypes may, in part, stem from reduced ER stress-induced cell death within endothelial and macrophage cells following injury. 
ACE inhibitor drugs decrease mortality by up to one-fifth in cardiovascular patients. Surprisingly, there are reports dating back to 1979 suggesting the existence of endogenous ACE inhibitors. Here we investigated the clinical significance of this potential endogenous ACE inhibition. ACE concentration and activity was measured in patient's serum samples (n = 151). ACE concentration was found to be in a wide range (47-288 ng/mL). ACE activity decreased with the increasing concentration of the serum albumin (HSA): ACE activity was 56 ± 1 U/L in the presence of 2.4 ± 0.3 mg/mL HSA, compared to 39 ± 1 U/L in the presence of 12 ± 1 mg/mL HSA (values are mean ± SEM). Effects of the differences in ACE concentration were suppressed in human sera: patients with ACE DD genotype exhibited a 64% higher serum ACE concentration (range, 74-288 ng/mL, median, 155.2 ng/mL, n = 52) compared to patients with II genotype (range, 47-194 ng/mL, median, 94.5 ng/mL, n = 28) while the difference in ACE activities was only 32% (range, 27.3-59.8 U/L, median, 43.11 U/L, and range 15.6-55.4 U/L, median, 32.74 U/L, respectively) in the presence of 12 ± 1 mg/mL HSA. No correlations were found between serum ACE concentration (or genotype) and cardiovascular diseases, in accordance with the proposed suppressed physiological ACE activities by HSA (concentration in the sera of these patients: 48.5 ± 0.5 mg/mL) or other endogenous inhibitors. Main implications are that (1) physiological ACE activity can be stabilized at a low level by endogenous ACE inhibitors, such as HSA; (2) angiotensin II elimination may have a significant role in angiotensin II related pathologies.
ACAT2 is the exclusive cholesterol-esterifying enzyme in hepatocytes and enterocytes. Hepatic ABCA1 transfers unesterified cholesterol (UC) to apoAI, thus generating HDL. By changing the hepatic UC pool available for ABCA1, ACAT2 may affect HDL metabolism. The aim of this study was to reveal whether hepatic ACAT2 influences HDL metabolism.
ATP6V0C is the bafilomycin A1-binding subunit of vacuolar ATPase, an enzyme complex that critically regulates vesicular acidification. We and others have shown previously that bafilomycin A1 regulates cell viability, autophagic flux and metabolism of proteins that accumulate in neurodegenerative disease. To determine the importance of ATP6V0C for autophagy-lysosome pathway function, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells differentiated to a neuronal phenotype were nucleofected with non-target or ATP6V0C siRNA and following recovery were treated with either vehicle or bafilomycin A1 (0.3-100 nM) for 48 h. ATP6V0C knockdown was validated by quantitative RT-PCR and by a significant decrease in Lysostracker Red staining. ATP6V0C knockdown significantly increased basal levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II), α-synuclein high molecular weight species and APP C-terminal fragments, and inhibited autophagic flux. Enhanced LC3 and LAMP-1 co-localization following knockdown suggests that autophagic flux was inhibited in part due to lysosomal degradation and not by a block in vesicular fusion. Knockdown of ATP6V0C also sensitized cells to the accumulation of autophagy substrates and a reduction in neurite length following treatment with 1 nM bafilomycin A1, a concentration that did not produce such alterations in non-target control cells. Reduced neurite length and the percentage of propidium iodide-positive dead cells were also significantly greater following treatment with 3 nM bafilomycin A1. Together these results indicate a role for ATP6V0C in maintaining constitutive and stress-induced ALP function, in particular the metabolism of substrates that accumulate in age-related neurodegenerative disease and may contribute to disease pathogenesis. 
GNE myopathy is a rare recessive myopathy associated with inclusion bodies on muscle biopsy. The clinical phenotype is associated with distal muscle weakness with quadriceps sparing. Most of the current information on GNE myopathy has been obtained through studies of Jewish and Japanese patient cohorts carrying founder mutations in the GNE gene. However, little is known about GNE myopathy in Europe where the prevalence is thought to be very low.
PTEN is a well known tumor suppressor through the negative regulation of the PI3K signaling pathway. Here we report that PTEN plays an important role in regulating mitotic timing, which is associated with increased PTEN phosphorylation in the C-terminal tail and its localization to chromatin. Pulldown analysis revealed that Plk1 physically interacted with PTEN. Biochemical studies showed that Plk1 phosphorylates PTEN in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner and that the phosphorylation was inhibited by Bi2635, a Plk1-specific inhibitor. Deletional and mutational analyses identified that Plk1 phosphorylated Ser-380, Thr-382, and Thr-383, but not Ser-385, a cluster of residues known to affect the PTEN stability. Interestingly, a combination of molecular and genetic analyses revealed that only Ser-380 was significantly phosphorylated in vivo and that Plk1 regulated the phosphorylation, which was associated with the accumulation of PTEN on chromatin. Moreover, expression of phospho-deficient mutant, but not wild-type PTEN, caused enhanced mitotic exit. Taken together, our studies identify Plk1 as an important regulator of PTEN during the cell cycle. 
CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme that can act as a NADase, generate cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose (cADPR) - a key Ca²⁺-mobilizing second messenger - and transport cADPR into cells. There have only been a small number of studies on the functions of CD38 in the central nervous system. In this study, we applied CD38 small interfering RNA (siRNA) to determine the effects of decreased CD38 on the intracellular ATP levels and survival of C6 glioma cells. Our study showed that both CD38 siRNA and 8-bromo-cADPR - a ryanodine receptor antagonist - can lead to a significant increase in the intracellular ATP levels of C6 glioma cells. We further found that the siRNA-induced CD38 reductions can induce decreases in the number of surviving cells. Our study has also suggested that P2X receptors contribute toward the CD38 siRNA-induced decreases in the cell survival. In summary, our study has provided novel evidence suggesting that CD38 mediates both the intracellular ATP levels and the survival of C6 glioma cells, suggesting that CD38 may become a therapeutic target for gliomas.
FUT2 and FUT3 genes are responsible for the formation of histo-blood group antigens, which act as binding sites for some intestinal microbes. Several studies suggested that FUT2 gene might affect the intestinal microbiota composition and modulate innate immune responses. However, the effect of FUT2 polymorphisms on Crohn's disease (CD) is uncertain. Our study aimed to analyze associations of CD with FUT2 and FUT3 polymorphisms in Chinese population.
CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 are involved in the inactivation of several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen. CYP2C9 is the major form in human liver whereas CYP2C8 has been proposed to be the main CYP2C enzyme in fetal liver. The protein expression of CYP2C9 in the first trimester is low, only about 1% of the adult values, whereas the mRNA levels of CYP2C8/9 have not been determined at the fetal stage. In this study the mRNA expression levels of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 were determined in 20 adult and 60 fetal liver tissue specimens. The expression profiles in fetal kidneys (n = 43), adrenals (n = 46), and lungs (n = 37) were also determined. Moreover the activity against ibuprofen hydroxylation was determined in fetus and adult liver microsomes. Adult liver samples expressed 140 and 400 times higher levels of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 mRNA, respectively, as compared to fetal liver samples. Consistent with this, the hydroxylation of ibuprofen was 40 times higher in the adult liver microsomes. Hepatic CYP2C8 mRNA was three times more abundant than CYP2C9 mRNA in the fetus. Moreover, CYP2C8 were consistently expressed in all fetal tissues investigated, whereas CYP2C9 gene expression was confined to the liver in fetuses. Our results indicate that CYP2C8 plays a more important physiological role than CYP2C9 in the first trimester. 
GALT induces tolerance to foreign food antigens and plays an important role in the development of food allergies and the inflammatory bowel disease. The immune function of GALT is significantly influenced by an equilibrium between Th1 and Th2 subpopulations and the cytokines they produce. Th1 cytokines participate in the induction of a cell-mediated immune response, whereas Th2 cytokines induce powerful antibody-mediated responses. Changes in Th1/Th2 cell polarization of an immune response are associated with susceptibility to autoimmune and infectious diseases. This experiment investigated changes in cytokine levels produced by Th1 and Th2 cells in ileal Payer's patches in gilts exposed to ZEN doses below the NOEL (approximately 8 microg kg(-1) BW) for 14, 28 and 42 days. A significant linear increase in IL-4 (40.32 +/- 1.55 ng mg(-1)--137.60 +/- 29.96 ng mg(-1)), and IL-10 (5.99 +/- 0.15 ng mg(-1)--16.39 +/- 1.11 ng mg(-1)) concentrations was observed. An increase in Th1 (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) cytokine levels was also noted in the experimental group, but it was not statistically significant. An HPLC analysis of Peyer's patches in group E animals revealed a linear increase in ZEN concentrations (3.65 +/- 0.91 ng g(-1)--4.72 +/- 1.85 ng g(-1)) and an absence of alpha-ZEL. IL-4 stimulates monocytes and macrophages, it induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines and it may directly and indirectly contribute to the development of inflammatory foci. Higher IL-4 levels could shift polarization toward Th2 cells, stimulate B cells to undergo class switching to produce IgE and contribute to the development of allergies.
CDA are a group of inherited, rare diseases that are characterized by dyserythropoiesis and ineffective erythropoiesis associated with transfusion dependency in approximately 10% of cases. For these latter patients, the only curative treatment is HSCT. There are very limited data on HSCT experience in this rare disease. Herein, we report a five-yr six-month-old girl with compound heterozygous mutations in SEC23B gene, who was diagnosed to have CDA type II and underwent successful HSCT from her matched sibling donor. 
ABCA1 is a major regulator of cellular cholesterol efflux and plasma HDL biogenesis. Even though the transcriptional activation of ABCA1 is well established, the posttranscriptional regulation of ABCA1 expression is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the potential contribution of the RNA binding protein (RBP) human antigen R (HuR) on the posttranscriptional regulation of ABCA1 expression. RNA immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate a direct interaction between HuR and ABCA1 mRNA. We found that HuR binds to the 3' untranslated region of ABCA1 and increases ABCA1 translation, while HuR silencing reduces ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux to ApoA1 in human hepatic (Huh-7) and monocytic (THP-1) cells. Interestingly, cellular cholesterol levels regulate the expression, intracellular localization, and interaction between HuR and ABCA1 mRNA. Finally, we found that HuR expression was significantly increased in macrophages from human atherosclerotic plaques, suggesting an important role for this RBP in controlling macrophage cholesterol metabolism in vivo. In summary, we have identified HuR as a novel posttranscriptional regulator of ABCA1 expression and cellular cholesterol homeostasis, thereby opening new avenues for increasing cholesterol efflux from atherosclerotic foam macrophages and raising circulat-ing HDL cholesterol levels.
LCAT (lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase) catalyzes the transacylation of a fatty acid of lecithin to cholesterol, generating a cholesteryl ester and lysolecithin. The knowledge of LCAT atomic structure and the identification of the amino acids relevant in controlling its structure and function are expected to be very helpful to understand the enzyme catalytic mechanism, as involved in HDL cholesterol metabolism. However - after an early report in the late '90 s - no recent advance has been made about LCAT three-dimensional structure. In this paper, we propose an LCAT atomistic model, built following the most up-to-date molecular modeling approaches, and exploiting newly solved crystallographic structures. LCAT shows the typical folding of the α/β hydrolase superfamily, and its topology is characterized by a combination of α-helices covering a central 7-strand β-sheet. LCAT presents a Ser/Asp/His catalytic triad with a peculiar geometry, which is shared with such other enzyme classes as lipases, proteases and esterases. Our proposed model was validated through different approaches. We evaluated the impact on LCAT structure of some point mutations close to the enzyme active site (Lys218Asn, Thr274Ala, Thr274Ile) and explained, at a molecular level, their phenotypic effects. Furthermore, we devised some LCAT modulators either designed through a de novo strategy or identified through a virtual high-throughput screening pipeline. The tested compounds were proven to be potent inhibitors of the enzyme activity. 
ABO genetic polymorphisms have recently been associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and inflammation, which play a critical role in the pathogenic mechanism of ACE inhibitor-induced cough. Therefore, the current study determined the association of ABO genetic polymorphisms with enalapril-induced cough in Chinese patients with essential hypertension.
PTEN is a lipid and protein phosphatase that regulates a diverse range of cellular mechanisms. PTEN is mainly present in the cytosol and transiently associates with the plasma membrane to dephosphorylate PI(3,4,5)P3, thereby antagonizing the PI3-Kinase signaling pathway. Recently, PTEN has been shown to associate also with organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the mitochondria, or the nucleus, and to be secreted outside of the cell. In addition, PTEN dynamically localizes to specialized sub-cellular compartments such as the neuronal growth cone or dendritic spines. The diverse localizations of PTEN imply a tight temporal and spatial regulation, orchestrated by mechanisms such as posttranslational modifications, formation of distinct protein-protein interactions, or the activation/recruitment of PTEN downstream of external cues. The regulation of PTEN function is thus not only important at the enzymatic activity level, but is also associated to its spatial distribution. In this review we will summarize (i) recent findings that highlight mechanisms controlling PTEN movement and sub-cellular localization, and (ii) current understanding of how PTEN localization is achieved by mechanisms controlling posttranslational modification, by association with binding partners and by PTEN structural or activity requirements. Finally, we will discuss the possible roles of compartmentalized PTEN in developing and mature neurons in health and disease. 
CD36 has been associated with obesity and diabetes in human liver diseases, however, its role in age-associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is unknown. Therefore, liver biopsies were collected from individuals with histologically normal livers (n=30), and from patients diagnosed with simple steatosis (NAS; n=26). Patients were divided into two groups according to age and liver biopsy samples were immunostained for CD36. NAFLD parameters were examined in young (12-week) and middle-aged (52-week) C57BL/6J mice, some fed with chow-diet and some fed with low-fat (LFD; 10% kcal fat) or high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal fat) for 12-weeks. CD36 expression was positively associated with age in individuals with normal livers but not in NAS patients. However, CD36 was predominantly located at the plasma membrane of hepatocytes in aged NAS patients as compared to young. In chow-fed mice, aging, despite an increase in hepatic CD36 expression, was not associated with the development of NAFLD. However, middle-aged mice did exhibit the development of HFD-induced NAFLD, mediated by an increase of CD36 on the membrane. Enhanced CD36-mediated hepatic fat uptake may contribute to an accelerated progression of NAFLD in mice and humans. Therapies to prevent the increase in CD36 expression and/or CD36 from anchoring at the membrane may prevent the development of NAFLD. 
PNPLA3 was recently associated with the susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a common cause of chronic liver disease characterized by abnormal triglyceride accumulation. Although it is established that PNPLA3 has both triacylglycerol lipase and acylglycerol O-acyltransferase activities, is still unknown whether the gene has any additional role in the modulation of the human liver metabolome. To uncover the functional role of PNPLA3 on liver metabolism, we performed high-throughput metabolic profiling of PNPLA3 siRNA-silencing and overexpression of wild-type and mutant Ile148Met variants (isoleucine/methionine substitution at codon 148) in Huh-7 cells. Metabolomic analysis was performed by using GC/MS and LC/MS platforms. Silencing of PNPLA3 was associated with a global perturbation of Huh-7 hepatoma cells that resembled a catabolic response associated with protein breakdown. A significant decrease in amino- and γ-glutamyl-amino acids and dipeptides and a significant increase in cysteine sulfinic acid, myo-inositol, lysolipids, sphingolipids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids were observed. Overexpression of the PNPLA3 Met148 variant mirrored many of the metabolic changes observed during gene silencing, but in the opposite direction. These findings were replicated by the exploration of canonical pathways associated with PNPLA3 silencing and Met148 overexpression. Overexpression of the PNPLA3 Met148 variant was associated with a 1.75-fold increase in lactic acid, suggesting a shift to anaerobic metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. Together, these results suggest a critical role of PNPLA3 in the modulation of liver metabolism beyond its classical participation in triacylglycerol remodeling.
PTEN dysfunction plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of hereditary and sporadic cancers. Here, we show that PTEN homodimerizes and, in this active conformation, exerts lipid phosphatase activity on PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. We demonstrate that catalytically inactive cancer-associated PTEN mutants heterodimerize with wild-type PTEN and constrain its phosphatase activity in a dominant-negative manner. To study the consequences of homo- and heterodimerization of wild-type and mutant PTEN in vivo, we generated Pten knockin mice harboring two cancer-associated PTEN mutations (PtenC124S and PtenG129E). Heterozygous Pten(C124S/+) and Pten(G129E/+) cells and tissues exhibit increased sensitivity to PI3-K/Akt activation compared to wild-type and Pten(+/-) counterparts, whereas this difference is no longer apparent between Pten(C124S/-) and Pten(-/-) cells. Notably, Pten KI mice are more tumor prone and display features reminiscent of complete Pten loss. Our findings reveal that PTEN loss and PTEN mutations are not synonymous and define a working model for the function and regulation of PTEN.
PTEN is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer. It is known that PTEN has a wide range of biological functions beyond tumor suppression. Here, we report that PTENα, an N-terminally extended form of PTEN, functions in mitochondrial metabolism. Translation of PTENα is initiated from a CUG codon upstream of and in-frame with the coding region of canonical PTEN. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A (eIF2A) controls PTENα translation, which requires a CUG-centered palindromic motif. We show that PTENα induces cytochrome c oxidase activity and ATP production in mitochondria. TALEN-mediated somatic deletion of PTENα impairs mitochondrial respiratory chain function. PTENα interacts with canonical PTEN to increase PINK1 protein levels and promote energy production. Our studies demonstrate the importance of eIF2A-mediated alternative translation for generation of protein diversity in eukaryotic systems and provide insights into the mechanism by which the PTEN family is involved in multiple cellular processes. 
AKR1C3 is an important human enzyme that participates in the reduction of steroids and prostaglandins, which leads to proliferative signalling. In addition, this enzyme also participates in the biotransformation of xenobiotics, such as drugs and procarcinogens. AKR1C3 is involved in the development of both hormone-dependent and hormone-independent cancers and was recently demonstrated to confer cell resistance to anthracyclines. Because AKR1C3 is frequently upregulated in various cancers, this enzyme has been suggested as a therapeutic target for the treatment of these pathological conditions. In this study, nineteen isoquinoline alkaloids were examined for their ability to inhibit a recombinant AKR1C3 enzyme. As a result, stylopine was demonstrated to be the most potent inhibitor among the tested compounds and exhibited moderate selectivity towards AKR1C3. In the follow-up cellular studies, stylopine significantly inhibited the AKR1C3-mediated reduction of daunorubicin in intact cells without considerable cytotoxic effects. This inhibitor could therefore be used as a model AKR1C3 inhibitor in research or evaluated as a possible therapeutic anticancer drug. Furthermore, based on our results, stylopine can serve as a model compound for the design and future development of structurally related AKR1C3 inhibitors. 
LPO processes and blood antioxidant status were studied in reproductive-age women with the hypothalamic syndrome. The control group consisted of somatically healthy women without reproductive disorders. Female patients with the hypothalamic syndrome were characterized by an imbalance in the LPO-antioxidant defense system, which aggravated the course of the underlying disease. 
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome ten) is a dual protein/lipid phosphatase that dephosphorylates PIP3, thereby inhibiting the AKT/mTOR pathway. This inhibition ultimately decreases protein translation, cell proliferation and cell growth. In the central nervous system, inhibition of PTEN leads to increased stem cell proliferation, somatic, dendritic and axonal growth, accelerated spine maturation, diminished synaptic plasticity, and altered intrinsic excitability. In agreement with these findings, patients carrying single-copy inactivating mutations of PTEN suffer from autism, macrocephaly, mental retardation, and epilepsy.(1) (-) (9) Understanding the mechanisms through which PTEN modulates the structure, function, and plasticity of cortical networks is a major focus of study. Preventing and reversing the changes induced by loss of Pten in model animals will pave the way for treatments in humans. 
RPE cells are the most actively phagocytic cells in the human body. In the eye, RPE cells face rod and cone photoreceptor outer segments at all times but contribute to shedding and clearance phagocytosis of distal outer segment tips only once a day. Analysis of RPE phagocytosis in situ has succeeded in identifying key players of the RPE phagocytic mechanism. Phagocytic processes comprise three distinct phases, recognition/binding, internalization, and digestion, each of which is regulated separately by phagocytes. Studies of phagocytosis by RPE cells in culture allow specifically analyzing and manipulating these distinct phases to identify their molecular mechanisms. Here, we compare similarities and differences of primary, immortalized, and stem cell-derived RPE cells in culture to RPE cells in situ with respect to phagocytic function. We discuss in particular potential pitfalls of RPE cell culture phagocytosis assays. Finally, we point out considerations for phagocytosis assay development for future studies. 
ABCG2 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family, which has been detected in a wide variety of human aggressive tumors, including glioma stem cells (GSCs), glioma tissues of higher grades, and implanted glioma xenografts. Previous research has implied that ABCG2 might be associated closely with invasion and spread in tumors. However, the specific roles and mechanisms of ABCG2 in regulating the migration and invasion of GSCs remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the effects and mechanisms of ABCG2 on invasion by GSCs. Our results showed that downregulation of ABCG2 protein significantly inhibited the migration and invasion potentials of U251 GSCs. Further research on the underlying mechanism showed that the effects of ABCG2 downregulation on inhibiting the migration and invasion of U251 GSCs were through significantly decreasing the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9, but not the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 protein. These findings show that ABCG2 plays an important role in regulating the migration and invasion of GSC, and represents a potential novel therapeutic agent to target the progression of GSCs. 
CYP2J2 enzyme is highly expressed in human tumors and carcinoma cell lines, and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, CYP2J2-mediated metabolites, have been implicated in the pathologic development of human cancers. To identify a CYP2J2 inhibitor, 50 natural products obtained from plants were screened using astemizole as a CYP2J2 probe substrate in human liver microsomes. Of these, decursin noncompetitively inhibited CYP2J2-mediated astemizole O-demethylation and terfenadine hydroxylation activities with Ki values of 8.34 and 15.8μM, respectively. It also showed cytotoxic effects against human hepatoma HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner while it did not show cytotoxicity against mouse hepatocytes. The present data suggest that decursin is a potential candidate for further evaluation for its CYP2J2 targeting anti-cancer activities. Studies are currently underway to test decursin as a potential therapeutic agent for cancer. 
AKR1B10 is a member of human aldo-keto reductase superfamily, and a promising anti-cancer therapeutic target. In this paper, androst-5-ene-3β-ol, dehydroepiandrosterone, pregnenolone and cholesterol were used as reactants, sixteen products were obtained through Jones reaction and reduction reaction using NaBH4. Their inhibitory activities against AKR1B10 and AKR1B1 were measured. The most active compound (3a) has the IC50 of 0.50μM for AKR1B10, and the most AKR1B10 selective compound (2a) has the IC50 of 0.81μM with AKR1B1/AKR1B10 selectivity of 195. In addition, the binding modes of 2a and 3a in the active site of human AKR1B10 were identified by docking. 
ABCG2 is a high-capacity urate exporter. Two frequent variants, Q126X and Q141K are a nonfunctional and half-functional variant, respectively. The estimated ABCG2 dysfunction based on the combination of Q126X and Q141K haplotype raises gout/hyperuricemia risk. ABCG2 dysfunction accounts for about 80% of gouty patients. Severe ABCG2 dysfunction particularly increased the risk of early-onset gout. Hyperuricemia has been clinically classified into urate 'overproduction type' and/or 'underexcretion type' based solely on renal urate excretion, without considering an extra-renal pathway. A major cause of'overproduction' hyperuricemia is not true overproduction of urate but rather'extra-renal urate underexcretion' by common ABCG2 dysfunction. As ABCG2 dysfunction is a main cause of gout, ABCG2 research will provide a new approach for prevention and treatment of gout.
PAH concentrations of 61 surface soil samples collected from the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China were measured to determine occurrence levels, sources, and potential toxicological significance of PAHs. The total concentrations of ∑PAHs ranged from 27 to 753 ng/g d.w., with a mean of 118±132 ng/g. The highest concentrations was found in the mid-southern part of the YRD (753 ng/g), which was associated with the oil exploration. The ratios indicated that the PAHs throughout the YRD were mostly of pyrogenic origin; while various sites in mid-southern part in the region were derived mainly from the petrogenic sources. Multivariate statistical analyses supported that the PAHs in surface soils of the YRD were principally from the coal and biomass combustion, petroleum spills, and/or vehicular emissions. The toxic assessment suggested that the PAHs in soils were at low potential of ecotoxicological contamination level for the YRD.
UGT2B17 is a vital member of the UGT2 family and functions as a detoxification enzyme which catalyzes the glucuronidation of lipophilic compounds. Accumulating evidences implicates that it may contribute to the susceptibility of tumor risk. Identification of a UGT2B17 deletion polymorphism has attracted studies to evaluate the association between the UGT2B17 deletion polymorphism and tumor risk in diverse populations. However, the available results are conflicting.
ABO rs495828 polymorphism has recently been associated with risk of hypertension and cough induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which could be due to low ACE plasma activity. To study whether ABO rs495828 is associated with ACE activity. The association between ABO genotype and phenotype, and differences in ACE activity between the ABO phenotype groups were also studied.
PTEN encodes a lipid phosphatase that is underexpressed in many cancers owing to deletions, mutations or gene silencing. PTEN dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate, thereby opposing the activity of class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases that mediate growth- and survival-factor signalling through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase effectors such as AKT and mTOR. To determine whether continued PTEN inactivation is required to maintain malignancy, here we generate an RNA interference-based transgenic mouse model that allows tetracycline-dependent regulation of PTEN in a time- and tissue-specific manner. Postnatal Pten knockdown in the haematopoietic compartment produced highly disseminated T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Notably, reactivation of PTEN mainly reduced T-cell leukaemia dissemination but had little effect on tumour load in haematopoietic organs. Leukaemia infiltration into the intestine was dependent on CCR9 G-protein-coupled receptor signalling, which was amplified by PTEN loss. Our results suggest that in the absence of PTEN, G-protein-coupled receptors may have an unanticipated role in driving tumour growth and invasion in an unsupportive environment. They further reveal that the role of PTEN loss in tumour maintenance is not invariant and can be influenced by the tissue microenvironment, thereby producing a form of intratumoral heterogeneity that is independent of cancer genotype. 
ABCB4 flops phosphatidylcholine into the bile canaliculus to protect the biliary tree from the detergent activity of bile salts. Homozygous-null ABCB4 mutations cause the childhood liver disease, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, but cause and effect is less clear, with many missense mutations linked to less severe cholestatic diseases. ABCB4(S320F), in particular, is described in 13 patients, including in heterozygosity with ABCB4(A286V), ABCB4(A953D), and null mutants, whose symptoms cover the spectrum of cholestatic disease. We sought to define the impact of these mutations on the floppase, explain the link with multiple conditions at the molecular level, and investigate the potential for reversal. ABCB4(S320F), ABCB4(A286V), and ABCB4(A953D) expression was engineered in naïve cultured cells. Floppase expression, localization, and activity were measured by western blot, confocal microscopy, and lipid transport assays, respectively. ABCB4(S320F) was fully active for floppase activity but expression at the plasma membrane was reduced to 50%. ABCB4(A286V) expressed and trafficked efficiently but could not flop lipid, and ABCB4(A953D) expressed poorly and was impaired in floppase activity. Proteasome inhibition stabilized nascent ABCB4(S320F) and ABCB4(A953D) but did not improve plasma membrane localization. Cyclosporin-A improved plasma membrane localization of both ABCB4(S320F) and ABCB4(A953D), but inhibited floppase activity.
ABCB1 (adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter B1) mediates cellular elimination of many chemotherapeutic agents including paclitaxel, which is commonly used to treat ovarian cancer. A significant association between common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABCB1 and progression-free survival has been reported in patients with ovarian cancer. Variable paclitaxel clearance due to genotype specific differences in ABCB1 activity in cancer cells and/or normal tissues may underlie the association. Using cell-based models, we evaluated the correlations between ABCB1 expression, polymorphisms, transporter activity and paclitaxel sensitivity in ovarian cancer (n = 10) and lymphoblastoid (n = 19) cell lines. Close associations between ABCB1 expression, transporter function and paclitaxel sensitivity were found in lymphoblastoid cell lines, although we could not demonstrate an association with common SNPs. In ovarian cancer cell lines, ABCB1 expression was low and the association between expression and function was lost. These results suggest that ABCB1 related survival difference in ovarian cancer patients is more likely to be due to differential whole body paclitaxel clearance mediated by normal cells rather than a direct effect on cancer cells. 
CA1 place cells discharge in prospective and retrospective modes, possibly reflecting memory retrieval and encoding, respectively. In this issue of Neuron, Bieri et al. (2014) report that slow and fast gamma oscillations associate with prospective and retrospective discharge, indicating that gamma oscillations organize information-processing modes.
ABCC8 encodes a subunit of the β-cell potassium channel (KATP ) whose loss of function is responsible for congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI). Patients with two recessive mutations of ABCC8 typically have severe diffuse forms of CHI unresponsive to diazoxide. Some dominant ABCC8 mutations are responsible for a subset of diffuse diazoxide-unresponsive forms of CHI. We report the analysis of 21 different ABCC8 mutations identified in 25 probands with diazoxide-unresponsive diffuse CHI and carrying a single mutation in ABCC8. Nine missense ABCC8 mutations were subjected to in vitro expression studies testing traffic efficiency and responses of mutant channels to activation by MgADP and diazoxide. Eight of the 9 missense mutations exhibited normal trafficking. Seven of the 8 mutants reaching the plasma membrane had dramatically reduced response to MgADP or to diazoxide (<10% of wild-type response). In our cohort, dominant KATP mutations account for 22% of the children with diffuse unresponsive-diazoxide CHI. Their clinical phenotype being indistinguishable from that of children with focal CHI and diffuse CHI forms due to two recessive KATP mutations, we show that functional testing is essential to make the most reliable diagnosis and offer appropriate genetic counseling. 
SYNJ1 has been recently identified by two independent groups as the gene defective in a novel form of autosomal recessive, early-onset atypical parkinsonism (PARK20). Two consanguineous families were initially reported (one of Sicilian and one of Iranian origins), with the same SYNJ1 homozygous mutation (c.773G > A, p.Arg258Gln) segregating with a similar phenotype of early-onset parkinsonism and additional atypical features. Here, we report the identification of the same SYNJ1 homozygous mutation in two affected siblings of a third pedigree. Both siblings had mild developmental psychomotor delay, followed, during the third decade of life, by progressive parkinsonism, dystonia, and mild cognitive impairment. One sibling suffered one episode of generalized seizures. Neuroimaging studies revealed severe nigrostriatal dopaminergic defects, mild striatal and very mild cortical hypometabolism. Treatment with dopamine agonists and anticholinergics resulted in partial improvements. Genetic analyses revealed in both siblings the SYNJ1 homozygous c.773G > A (p.Arg258Gln) mutation. Haplotype analysis suggests that the mutation has arisen independently in this family and the Sicilian PARK20 family previously described by us, in keeping with the hypothesis of a mutational hot spot. This is the third reported family with autosomal recessive, early-onset parkinsonism associated with the SYNJ1 p.Arg258Gln mutation. This work contributes to the definition of the genetic and clinical aspects of PARK20. This newly recognized form must be considered in the diagnostic work-up of patients with early-onset atypical parkinsonism. The presence of seizures might represent a red flag to suspect PARK20.
NSD1 point mutations, submicroscopic deletions and intragenic deletions are the major cause of Sotos syndrome, characterized by pre-postnatal generalized overgrowth with advanced bone age, learning disability, seizures, distinctive facial phenotype. Reverse clinical phenotype due to 5q35 microduplication encompassing NSD1 gene has been reported so far in 27 cases presenting with delayed bone age, microcephaly, failure to thrive and seizures in some cases, further supporting a gene dosage effect of NSD1 on growth regulation and neurological functions. Here we depict the clinical presentation of three new cases with 5q35 microduplication outlining a novel syndrome characterized by microcephaly, short stature, developmental delay and in some cases delayed bone maturation, without any typical facial or osseous anomalies.
CYP2C9 metabolizes approximately 20% of clinically used drugs, including the narrow therapeutic window drugs warfarin and phenytoin. More than 16,000 variants have been reported in the National Center for Biotechnology Information CYP2C9 database, as well as 58 alleles in the official P450 Nomenclature Committee website. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms represented by the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles have been studied extensively. However, in addition to these two alleles, other genetic factors and an individual's biological characteristics contribute to the overall drug phenotype. A major bottleneck for CYP2C9 pharmacogenomics in clinical field applications is the lack of knowledge regarding the numerous genetic polymorphisms and their molecular functionalities. An unmet gap exists between the ever-growing number of genetic variants and their molecular mechanisms. In the present review, functional changes of all known CYP2C9 protein coding alleles were predicted using in silico analyses and compared with the in vitro and in vivo data. We also summarize functional information from recently reported CYP2C9 variants. Regarding the previously known CYP2C9 variants, we provide an update on the functional information obtained from in vitro and in vitro data.
PHOSPHO1 and tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) have nonredundant functions during skeletal mineralization. Although TNAP deficiency (Alpl(-/-) mice) leads to hypophosphatasia, caused by accumulation of the mineralization inhibitor inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi ), comparably elevated levels of PPi in Phospho1(-/-) mice do not explain their stunted growth, spontaneous fractures, bowed long bones, osteomalacia, and scoliosis. We have previously shown that elevated PPi in Alpl(-/-) mice is accompanied by elevated osteopontin (OPN), another potent mineralization inhibitor, and that the amount of OPN correlates with the severity of hypophosphatasia in mice. Here we demonstrate that plasma OPN is elevated and OPN expression is upregulated in the skeleton, particularly in the vertebrae, of Phospho1(-/-) mice. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry showed an increased proportion of phosphorylated OPN (p-OPN) peptides in Phospho1(-/-) mice, suggesting that accumulation of p-OPN causes the skeletal abnormalities in Phospho1(-/-) mice. We also show that ablation of the OPN gene, Spp1, leads to improvements in the skeletal phenotype in Phospho1(-/-) as they age. In particular, their scoliosis is ameliorated at 1 month of age and is completely rescued at 3 months of age. There is also improvement in the long bone defects characteristic of Phospho1(-/-) mice at 3 months of age. Mineralization assays comparing [Phospho1(-/-) ; Spp1(-/-) ], Phospho1(-/-) , and Spp1(-/-) chondrocytes display corrected mineralization by the double knockout cells. Expression of chondrocyte differentiation markers was also normalized in the [Phospho1(-/-) ; Spp1(-/-) ] mice. Thus, although Alpl and Phospho1 deficiencies lead to similar skeletal phenotypes and comparable changes in the expression levels of PPi and OPN, there is a clear dissociation in the hierarchical roles of these potent inhibitors of mineralization, with elevated PPi and elevated p-OPN levels causing the respective skeletal phenotypes in Alpl(-/-) and Phospho1(-/-) mice.
CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) are not homogeneous but rather can be grouped by molecular, morphological, and functional properties. However, less is known about synaptic sources differentiating PCs. Using paired recordings in vitro, two-photon Ca(2+) imaging in vivo, and computational modeling, we found that parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (PVBCs) evoked greater inhibition in CA1 PCs located in the deep compared to superficial layer of stratum pyramidale. In turn, analysis of reciprocal connectivity revealed more frequent excitatory inputs to PVBCs by superficial PCs, demonstrating bias in target selection by both the excitatory and inhibitory local connections in CA1. Additionally, PVBCs further segregated among deep PCs, preferentially innervating the amygdala-projecting PCs but receiving preferential excitation from the prefrontal cortex-projecting PCs, thus revealing distinct perisomatic inhibitory interactions between separate output channels. These results demonstrate the presence of heterogeneous PVBC-PC microcircuits, potentially contributing to the sparse and distributed structure of hippocampal network activity.
CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 play pivotal roles in adrenocorticosteroids synthesis. We performed semi-quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of these proteins in adrenals from patients with primary aldosteronism using novel monoclonal antibodies. Clusters of cortical cells positive for CYP11B2 were detected in the zona glomerulosa (ZG) of normal adrenal gland (NA), idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) and the adjacent adrenal of aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA). In APA, heterogenous immunolocalization of CYP11B2 and diffuse immunoreactivity of CYP11B1 were detected in tumor cells, respectively. The relative immunoreactivity of CYP11B2 in the ZG of adjacent adrenal of APA was significantly lower than that of NA, IHA and APA tumor cells, suggestive of suppressed aldosterone biosynthesis in these cells. These findings did indicate the regulatory mechanisms of aldosterone biosynthesis were different between normal/hyperplastic and neoplastic aldosterone-producing cells in human adrenals. CYP11B2 immunoreactivity in the ZG could also serve as a potential immunohistochemical marker differentiating morphologically hyperplastic ZG of IHA and APA adjacent adrenal. 
PHEX or DMP1 mutations cause hypophosphatemic-rickets and altered energy metabolism. PHEX binds to DMP1-ASARM-motif to form a complex with α5β3 integrin that suppresses FGF23 expression. ASARM-peptides increase FGF23 by disrupting the PHEX-DMP1-Integrin complex. We used a 4.2 kDa peptide (SPR4) that binds to ASARM-peptide/motif to study the DMP1-PHEX interaction and to assess SPR4 for the treatment of energy metabolism defects in HYP and potentially other bone-mineral disorders.
HLCS (holocarboxylase synthetase) is a nuclear protein that catalyses the binding of biotin to distinct lysine residues in chromatin proteins. HLCS-dependent epigenetic marks are over-represented in repressed genomic loci, particularly in repeats. Evidence is mounting that HLCS is a member of a multi-protein gene repression complex, which determines its localization in chromatin. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that HLCS interacts physically with N-CoR (nuclear receptor co-repressor) and HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1), thereby contributing toward the removal of H3K9ac (Lys⁹-acetylated histone H3) gene activation marks and the repression of repeats. Physical interactions between HLCS and N-CoR, HDAC1 and a novel splicing variant of HDAC1 were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, limited proteolysis and split luciferase complementation assays. When HLCS was overexpressed, the abundance of H3K9ac marks decreased by 50% and 68% in LTRs (long terminal repeats) 15 and 22 respectively in HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells compared with the controls. This loss of H3K9ac marks was linked with an 83% decrease in mRNA coding for LTRs. Similar patterns were seen in pericentromeric alpha satellite repeats in chromosomes 1 and 4. We conclude that interactions of HLCS with N-CoR and HDACs contribute towards the transcriptional repression of repeats, presumably increasing genome stability.
CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36) is a scavenger receptor that functions in high-affinity tissue uptake of long-chain fatty acids (FAs) and contributes under excessive fat supply to lipid accumulation and metabolic dysfunction. This review describes recent evidence regarding the CD36 FA binding site and a potential mechanism for FA transfer. It also presents the view that CD36 and FA signaling coordinate fat utilization, a view that is based on newly identified CD36 actions that involve oral fat perception, intestinal fat absorption, secretion of the peptides cholecystokinin and secretin, regulation of hepatic lipoprotein output, activation of beta oxidation by muscle, and regulation of the production of the FA-derived bioactive eicosanoids. Thus abnormalities of fat metabolism and the associated pathology might involve dysfunction of CD36-mediated signal transduction in addition to the changes in FA uptake. 
ALDH1A1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A1) is highly expressed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We assessed the potential clinical value of serum ALDH1A1 in the diagnosis and prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer.
ACSL4 is a member of the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) family with a marked preference for arachidonic acid (AA) as its substrate. Although an association between elevated levels of ACSL4 and hepatosteatosis has been reported, the function of ACSL4 in hepatic FA metabolism and the regulation of its functional expression in the liver remain poorly defined. Here we provide evidence that AA selectively downregulates ACSL4 protein expression in hepatic cells. AA treatment decreased the half-life of ACSL4 protein in HepG2 cells by approximately 4-fold (from 17.3 ± 1.8 h to 4.2 ± 0.4 h) without causing apoptosis. The inhibitory action of AA on ACSL4 protein stability could not be prevented by rosiglitazone or inhibitors that interfere with the cellular pathways involved in AA metabolism to biologically active compounds. In contrast, treatment of cells with inhibitors specific for the proteasomal degradation pathway largely prevented the AA-induced ACSL4 degradation. We further show that ACSL4 is intrinsically ubiquitinated and that AA treatment can enhance its ubiquitination. Collectively, our studies have identified a novel substrate-induced posttranslational regulatory mechanism by which AA downregulates ACSL4 protein expression in hepatic cells. 
CYP24A1 is the multicatalytic cytochrome P450 responsible for the catabolism of vitamin D via the C23- and C24-oxidation pathways. We successfully expressed the labile human enzyme in Escherichia coli and partially purified it in an active state that permitted detailed characterization of its metabolism of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2 D3] and the intermediates of the C24-oxidation pathway in a phospholipid-vesicle reconstituted system. The C24-oxidation pathway intermediates, 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3, 24-oxo-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 24-oxo-1,23,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 and tetranor-1,23-dihydroxyvitamin D3, were enzymatically produced from 1,25(OH)2 D3 using rat CYP24A1. Both 1,25(OH)2 D3 and 1,23-dihydroxy-24,25,26,27-tetranorvitamin D3 were found to partition strongly into the phospholipid bilayer when in aqueous medium. Changes to the phospholipid concentration did not affect the kinetic parameters for the metabolism of 1,25(OH)2 D3 by CYP24A1, indicating that it is the concentration of substrates in the membrane phase (mol substrate·mol phospholipid(-1) ) that determines their rate of metabolism. CYP24A1 exhibited Km values for the different C24-intermediates ranging from 0.34 to 15 mmol·mol phospholipid(-1) , with 24-oxo-1,23,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 [24-oxo-1,23,25(OH)3 D3] displaying the lowest and 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,24,25(OH)3 D3] displaying the highest. The kcat values varied by up to 3.8-fold, with 1,24,25(OH)3 D3 displaying the highest kcat (34 min(-1) ) and 24-oxo-1,23,25(OH)3 D3 the lowest. The data show that the cleavage of the side chain of 24-oxo-1,23,25(OH)3 D3 occurs with the highest catalytic efficiency (kcat /Km ) and produces 1-hydroxy-23-oxo-24,25,26,27-tetranorvitamin D3 and not 1,23-dihydroxy-24,25,26,27-tetranorvitamin D3, as the primary product. These kinetic analyses also show that intermediates of the C24-oxidation pathway effectively compete with precursor substrates for binding to the active site of the enzyme, which manifests as an accumulation of intermediates, indicating that they dissociate after each catalytic step. 
IDH1 codon 132 mutation (mostly Arg132His) is frequently found in gliomas and is associated with longer survival. However, it is still unclear whether IDH1 mutation renders the cell more vulnerable to current treatment, radio- and chemotherapy.
CYP11B1 is the key enzyme in cortisol biosynthesis, and its inhibition with selective compounds is a promising strategy for the treatment of diseases associated with elevated cortisol levels, such as Cushing's syndrome or metabolic disease. Expanding on a previous study from our group resulting in the first potent and rather selective inhibitor described so far (1, IC50 = 152 nM), we herein describe further optimizations of the imidazolylmethyl pyridine core. Five compounds among the 42 substances synthesized showed IC50 values below 50 nM. Most interesting was the naphth-1-yl compound 23 (IC50 = 42 nM), showing a 49-fold selectivity toward the highly homologous CYP11B2 (1: 18-fold) as well as selectivity toward the androgen and estrogen forming enzymes CYP17 and CYP19, respectively. 
CD36 is a membrane glycoprotein that is present on various types of cells, including monocytes, macrophages, microvascular endothelial cells, adipocytes and platelets. Macrophage CD36 participates in atherosclerotic arterial lesion formation through its interaction with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), which triggers signaling cascades for inflammatory responses. CD36 functions in oxLDL uptake and foam cell formation, which is the initial critical stage of atherosclerosis. In addition, oxLDL via CD36 inhibits macrophage migration, which may be a macrophage-trapping mechanism in atherosclerotic lesions. The role of CD36 was examined in in vitro studies and in vivo experiments, which investigated various functions of CD36 in atherosclerosis and revealed that CD36 deficiency reduces atherosclerotic lesion formation. Platelet CD36 also promotes atherosclerotic inflammatory processes and is involved in thrombus formation after atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Because CD36 is an essential component of atherosclerosis, defining the function of CD36 and its corresponding signaling pathway may lead to a new treatment strategy for atherosclerosis. 
ABCA1 and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI)/CD36 and lysosomal integral membrane protein II analogous 1 (CLA-1) are the key transporter and receptor in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Increasing the expression level of ABCA1 and SR-BI/CLA-1 is antiatherogenic. The aim of the study was to find novel antiatherosclerotic agents upregulating expression of ABCA1 and SR-BI/CLA-1 from natural compounds. Using the ABCA1p-LUC and CLA-1p-LUC HepG2 cell lines, we found that rutaecarpine (RUT) triggered promoters of ABCA1 and CLA-1 genes. RUT increased ABCA1 and SR-BI/CLA-1 expression in vitro related to liver X receptor alpha and liver X receptor beta. RUT induced cholesterol efflux in RAW264.7 cells. ApoE-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice treated with RUT for 8 weeks showed ∼68.43, 70.23, and 85.56% less en face lesions for RUT (L), RUT (M), and RUT (H) groups, respectively, compared with the model group. Mouse macrophage-specific antibody and filipin staining indicated that RUT attenuated macrophages and cholesterol accumulations in atherosclerotic lesions, respectively. Additionally, ABCA1 and SR-BI expression was highly induced by RUT in livers of ApoE(-/-) mice. Meanwhile, RUT treatment significantly increased the fecal (3)H-cholesterol excretion, which demonstrated that RUT could promote RCT in vivo. RUT was identified to be a candidate that protected ApoE(-/-) mice from developing atherosclerosis through preferentially promoting activities of ABCA1 and SR-BI within RCT. 
CYP2D6 gene encoding CYP2D6 enzyme belonging to the cytochrome P450 system has aroused long attention being a candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the results remain inconsistent and underpowered.
NQO1 (NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1), located on chromosome 16q22, functions primarily to protect normal cells from oxidant stress and electrophilic attack. Recent studies have revealed that NQO1 is expressed at a high level in most human solid tumors including those of the colon, breast, pancreas, ovaries and thyroid, and it has also been detected following the induction of cell cycle progression and proliferation of melanoma cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinicopathological significance of upregulated NQO1 protein expression in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the uterine cervix.
PNPLA3 I148M polymorphism (rs738409) has been strongly associated with liver fat content and plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in obese adults and children, but little is known about these relationships in normal weight individuals. We studied the associations and interactions of overweight and the PNPLA3 I148M polymorphism with plasma ALT levels during 2-year follow-up in children.
CYP4F2 and γ-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) have small but significant roles in the maintenance dose of coumarinic oral anticoagulants (COAs). CYP4F2 1347 G > A and GGCX 12970 C > G polymorphisms have been used in the pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms of warfarin for Caucasians and Chinese populations. India has a large population with multiple ethnic groups but there are no reports about the frequencies of these polymorphisms in north Indians. In the present study, we aimed to find out the allelic frequencies of CYP4F2 1347 G > A and GGCX 12970 C > G polymorphisms in a north Indian population and relate these to daily maintenance drug dose requirements of COA.
CHIT1 is expressed by pulmonary macrophages, which is typically the site of entry for many environmental fungi that may increase the risk of pulmonary fungal infection and lead to hypersensitivity. The conserved expression of this gene in humans suggests its physiological importance in the mammalian lung.
LPIN1 encodes lipin-1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) enzyme that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to form diacylglycerol. Homozygous LPIN1 gene mutations cause severe rhabdomyolysis, and heterozygous LPIN1 missense mutations may promote statin-induced myopathy. We demonstrate that lipin-1-related myopathy in the mouse is associated with a blockade in autophagic flux and accumulation of aberrant mitochondria. Lipin-1 PAP activity is required for maturation of autolysosomes, through its activation of the protein kinase D (PKD)-Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling cascade. Statin treatment also reduces PKD activation and autophagic flux, which are compounded by diminished mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) abundance in lipin-1-haploinsufficent and -deficient muscle. Lipin-1 restoration in skeletal muscle prevents myonecrosis and statin toxicity in vivo, and activated PKD rescues autophagic flux in lipin-1-deficient cells. Our findings identify lipin-1 PAP activity as a component of the macroautophagy pathway and define the basis for lipin-1-related myopathies. 
WWOX was cloned as a putative tumor suppressor gene mapping to chromosomal fragile site FRA16D. Deletions affecting WWOX accompanied by loss of expression are frequent in various epithelial cancers. Translocations and deletions affecting WWOX are also common in multiple myeloma and are associated with worse prognosis. Metanalysis of gene expression datasets demonstrates that low WWOX expression is significantly associated with shorter relapse-free survival in ovarian and breast cancer patients. Although somatic mutations affecting WWOX are not frequent, analysis of TCGA tumor datasets led to identifying 44 novel mutations in various tumor types. The highest frequencies of mutations were found in head and neck cancers and uterine and gastric adenocarcinomas. Mouse models of gene ablation led us to conclude that Wwox does not behave as a highly penetrant, classical tumor suppressor gene since its deletion is not tumorigenic in most models and its role is more likely to be of relevance in tumor progression rather than in initiation. Analysis of signaling pathways associated with WWOX expression confirmed previous in vivo and in vitro observations linking WWOX function with the TGFβ/SMAD and WNT signaling pathways and with specific metabolic processes. Supporting these conclusions recently we demonstrated that indeed WWOX behaves as a modulator of TGFβ/SMAD signaling by binding and sequestering SMAD3 in the cytoplasmic compartment. As a consequence progressive loss of WWOX expression in advanced breast cancer would contribute to the pro-metastatic effects resulting from TGFβ/SMAD3 hyperactive signaling in breast cancer. Recently, GWAS and resequencing studies have linked the WWOX locus with familial dyslipidemias and metabolic syndrome related traits. Indeed, gene expression studies in liver conditional KO mice confirmed an association between WWOX expression and lipid metabolism. Finally, very recently the first human pedigrees with probands carrying homozygous germline loss of function WWOX mutations have been identified. These patients are characterized by severe CNS related pathology that includes epilepsy, ataxia and mental retardation. In summary, WWOX is a highly conserved and tightly regulated gene throughout evolution and when defective or deregulated the consequences are important and deleterious as demonstrated by its association not only with poor prognosis in cancer but also with other important human pathologies such as metabolic syndrome and CNS related pathologic conditions. 
ABO dependent variation in von Willebrand factor (vWf) and procoagulant factor VIII (FVIII) is a plausible mechanism for modulating perioperative hemostasis and bleeding. Group AB has the highest and group O the lowest vWf and FVIII levels. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ABO blood group is associated with perioperative transfusion and subsequent survival after coronary revascularization. This retrospective study combined demographic, operative, and transfusion data, including follow-up for a median of 2,096 days, for consecutive aortocoronary bypass (CABG) and CABG/valve procedures from 1996-2009 at a tertiary referral University Heart Center. Between group differences were compared by a Kruskall Wallis test, and hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals] are reported for mortality risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. From 15,454 patients, follow-up records were available for 13,627 patients: 6,413 group O, 5,248 group A, 1,454 group B, and 435 group AB. Packed red blood cells were the most commonly transfused blood product (3 [0-5] units), while group AB received 2 [0-5] units (Kruskall Wallis Chi squared value for between group differences = 8.2; p = 0.04). Group AB favored improved long-term, postoperative survival (Hazard ratio = 0.82 [95%CI 0.68-0.98]; p = 0.03), which became evident approximately a year after surgery. In conclusion, the procoagulant phenotype of blood group AB is associated with fewer transfusions and improved late survival after cardiac surgery. Whether this finding is related to fewer perioperative transfusions, a reduction in later bleeding or other mechanisms remains speculative.
ABO blood group antigens are complex carbohydrate molecules expressed on the surface of red blood cells and a variety of human cells and tissues. It is well known that ABO blood type exerts a profound influence on hemostasis, being a major determinant of von Willebrand factor (VWF), and consequently factor VIII, plasma levels. In this review, we will focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between ABO blood group and VWF in normal and pathological conditions.
ABO blood serotype A is known to be associated with risk of gastric cancer (GC), but little is known how ABO alleles and the fucosyltransferase (FUT) enzymes and genes which are involved in Lewis antigen formation [and in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) binding and pathogenicity] may be related to GC risk in a European population. The authors conducted an investigation of 32 variants at ABO and FUT1-7 loci and GC risk in a case-control study of 365 cases and 1,284 controls nested within the EPIC cohort (the EPIC-Eurgast study). Four variants (including rs505922) in ABO, and allelic blood group A (AO+AA, odds ratio=1.84, 95%CI=1.20-2.80) were associated with diffuse-type GC; however, conditional models with other ABO variants indicated that the associations were largely due to allelic blood group A. One variant in FUT5 was also associated with diffuse-type GC, and four variants (and haplotypes) in FUT2 (Se), FUT3 (Le) and FUT6 with intestinal-type GC. Further, one variant in ABO, two in FUT3 and two in FUT6 were associated with H. pylori infection status in controls, and two of these (in FUT3 and FUT6) were weakly associated with intestinal-type GC risk. None of the individual variants surpassed a Bonferroni corrected p-value cutoff of 0.0016; however, after a gene-based permutation test, two loci [FUT3(Le)/FUT5/FUT6 and FUT2(Se)] were significantly associated with diffuse- and intestinal-type GC, respectively. Replication and functional studies are therefore recommended to clarify the role of ABO and FUT alleles in H. pylori infection and subtype-specific gastric carcinogenesis.
CYP19A1 encodes the aromatase which catalyzes the final reaction of estrogen biosynthesis. The bovine genome also contains a non-coding copy of CYP19A1, the transcribed pseudogene CYP19P1. Whereas CYP19A1 is transcribed in all estrogen-producing tissues, mainly in the placenta and gonads, the CYP19P1 transcript so far was detected in the placenta. Strikingly, one sequence segment of both transcripts exhibits an exceptional high identity of 98%, which implies selective pressure and suggests some kind of function. Only recently, indeed, coding-independent functions of several transcribed pseudogenes were reported. Therefore, we analyzed CYP19P1 and CYP19A1 transcripts with the aim to detect clues for gene-pseudogene interference.
PRPS1 codes for the enzyme phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase-1 (PRS-1). The spectrum of PRPS1-related disorders associated with reduced activity includes Arts syndrome, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-5 (CMTX5) and X-linked non-syndromic sensorineural deafness (DFN2). We describe a novel phenotype associated with decreased PRS-1 function in two affected male siblings. Using whole exome and Sanger sequencing techniques, we identified a novel missense mutation in PRPS1. The clinical phenotype in our patients is characterized by high prenatal maternal α-fetoprotein, intrauterine growth restriction, dysmorphic facial features, severe intellectual disability and spastic quadraparesis. Additional phenotypic features include macular coloboma-like lesions with retinal dystrophy, severe short stature and diabetes insipidus. Exome sequencing of the two affected male siblings identified a shared putative pathogenic mutation c.586C>T p.(Arg196Trp) in the PRPS1 gene that was maternally inherited. Follow-up testing showed normal levels of hypoxanthine in urine samples and uric acid levels in blood serum. The PRS activity was significantly reduced in erythrocytes of the two patients. Nucleotide analysis in erythrocytes revealed abnormally low guanosine triphosphate and guanosine diphosphate. This presentation is the most severe form of PRPS1-deficiency syndrome described to date and expands the spectrum of PRPS1-related disorders. 
CYP3A4 induction by efavirenz (EFV) persists after drug cessation; we assessed the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy and safety of maraviroc (MVC) administered to HIV-infected individuals switching from EFV-containing therapy.
ABCG2 is a potential biomarker causing multidrug resistance (MDR) in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). We conducted this study to investigate whether Icotinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase, could interact with ABCG2 transporter in NSCLC. Our results showed that Icotinib reversed ABCG2-mediated MDR by antagonizing the drug efflux function of ABCG2. Icotinib stimulated the ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited the photolabeling of ABCG2 with [125I]-Iodoarylazidoprazosin, demonstrating that it interacts at the drug-binding pocket. Homology modeling predicted the binding conformation of Icotinib at Asn629 centroid-based grid of ABCG2. However, Icotinib at reversal concentration did not affect the expression levels of AKT and ABCG2. Furthermore, a combination of Icotinib and topotecan exhibited significant synergistic anticancer activity against NCI-H460/MX20 tumor xenografts. However, the inhibition of transport activity of ABCG2 was insufficient to overcome pemetrexed resistance in NCI-H460/MX20 cells, which was due to the co-upregulated thymidylate synthase (TS) and ABCG2 expression. This is the first report to show that the up-regulation of TS in ABCG2-overexpressing cell line NCI-H460/MX20 may play a role of resistance to pemetrexate. Our findings suggested different possible strategies of overcoming the resistance of topotecan and pemetrexed in the NSCLC patients. 
PIK3CA (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit α) somatic mutations are the most common genetic alteration in breast cancer (BC). Their prognostic value and that of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in BC remains only partly defined. The effect of PIK3CA mutations and alterations of the PI3K pathway on the antiproliferative response to aromatase inhibitor treatment was determined.
AKR1C3 is a novel therapeutic target in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer because of its ability to produce testosterone and 17β-estradiol intratumorally, thus promoting nuclear receptor signaling and tumor progression. A panel of CRPC, ER-positive breast cancer and high/low AKR1C3-expressing cell lines were treated with SN33638, a selective inhibitor of AKR1C3, in the presence of hormone or prostaglandin (PG) precursors, prior to evaluation of cell proliferation and levels of 11β-PG F2α (11β-PGF2α), testosterone, 17β-estradiol, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). A meta-analysis of AKR1C3 mRNA expression in patient samples was also conducted, which revealed that AKR1C3 mRNA was upregulated in CRPC, but downregulated in ER-positive breast cancer. 11β-PGF2α and testosterone levels in the cell line panel correlated with AKR1C3 protein expression. SN33638 prevented 11β-PGF2α formation in cell lines that expressed AKR1C3, but partially inhibited testosterone formation and subsequently cell proliferation and/or PSA expression only in high (LAPC4 AKR1C3-overexpressing cells) or moderate (22RV1) AKR1C3-expressing cell lines. SN33638 had little effect on 17β-estradiol production or estrone-stimulated cell proliferation in ER-positive breast cancer cell lines. Although SN33638 could prevent 11β-PGF2α formation, its ability to prevent testosterone and 17β-estradiol production and their roles in CRPC and ER-positive breast cancer progression was limited due to AKR1C3-independent steroid hormone production, except in LAPC4 AKR1C3 cells where the majority of testosterone was AKR1C3-dependent. These results suggest that inhibition of AKR1C3 is unlikely to produce therapeutic benefit in CRPC and ER-positive breast cancer patients, except possibly in the small subpopulation of CRPC patients with tumors that have upregulated AKR1C3 expression and are dependent on AKR1C3 to produce the testosterone required for their growth. 
GBA mutations are an important risk factor in developing Parkinson's disease (PD) worldwide. The study aimed to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of GBA mutations in a Thai PD cohort of 480 patients and 395 control subjects.
ABO incompatibility and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency G6PD are common haematological problems affecting the newborn. The resulting haemolytic disease of foetus and newborn (HDFN) caused by either of these pathologies generally follows a benign course. It is typically characterized by mild jaundice without significant anaemia. ABO incompatibility alone as a cause of foetal hydrops is extremely rare. We report a case of a newborn baby girl with an anti-B isoimmunisation and G6PD deficiency manifesting with hydrops foetalis, anaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia, born to a mother with blood group O. 
GNE myopathy is an autosomal recessive muscle disease caused by biallelic mutations in GNE, a gene encoding for a single protein with key enzymatic activities, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase and N-acetylmannosamine kinase, in sialic acid biosynthetic pathway. The diagnosis should be considered primarily in patients presenting with distal weakness (foot drop) in early adulthood (other onset symptoms are possible too). The disease slowly progresses to involve other lower and upper extremities' muscles, with marked sparing of the quadriceps. Characteristic findings on biopsies of affected muscles include 'rimmed' (autophagic) vacuoles, aggregation of various proteins and fibre size variation. The diagnosis is confirmed by sequencing of the GNE gene. Note that we use a new mutation nomenclature based on the longest transcript (GenBank: NM_001128227), which encodes a 31-amino acid longer protein than the originally described one (GenBank: NM_005476), which has been used previously in most papers. Based upon the pathophysiology of the disease, recent clinical trials as well as early gene therapy trials have evaluated the use of sialic acid or N-acetylmannosamine (a precursor of sialic acid) in patients with GNE myopathy. Now that therapies are under investigation, it is critical that a timely and accurate diagnosis is made in patients with GNE myopathy. 
CYP2C19 genotype has been shown to impact response to clopidogrel 75-mg but not prasugrel 10-mg. Here, we assessed effects of CYP2C19 metaboliser status on pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) responses to prasugrel 5-mg and 10-mg and clopidogrel 75-mg using data from two PK/PD studies in stable coronary artery disease (CAD) patients (GENERATIONS and FEATHER). Active metabolite concentrations (area under the curve, AUC[0-tlast]), maximum platelet aggregation (MPA) measured by light transmission aggregometry, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein platelet reactivity index, and VerifyNow P2Y12-platelet reaction units (VN-PRU) were analysed by CYP2C19-predicted phenotype (extensive metaboliser [EM; N=154], *2-*8 non-carriers, vs reduced metaboliser [RM; N=41],*2-*8 carriers/*17 non-carriers). AUC(0-tlast) was unaffected by metaboliser status for prasugrel 5-mg and 10-mg (geometric mean EM/RM ratios 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86,1.17, p>0.99; and 0.97, 95% CI:0.85,1.12, p=0.71, respectively), but was lower among RMs receiving clopidogrel 75-mg (1.37, 95% CI:1.14,1.65, p<0.001). Platelet reactivity was not significantly affected by CYP2C19 metaboliser status for prasugrel 5-mg, or for prasugrel 10-mg by MPA and VN-PRU, but for clopidogrel 75-mg was significantly higher in reduced metabolisers (all measures p<0.01). Prasugrel 10-mg showed greater antiplatelet effects vs clopidogrel 75-mg (all comparisons p<0.001). Prasugrel 5-mg showed greater antiplatelet effects vs clopidogrel 75-mg in RMs (all p<0.001), and comparable effects in EMs (all p≥0.37). In contrast to clopidogrel, prasugrel active metabolite PK was not influenced by CYP2C19 genotype. Antiplatelet effect for prasugrel 10-mg was greater irrespective of metaboliser status and for prasugrel 5-mg was greater for RMs and comparable for EMs as compared to clopidogrel 75-mg. 
ALPL encodes the tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP), which removes phosphate groups from various substrates. Its function is essential for bone and tooth mineralization. In humans, ALPL mutations lead to hypophosphatasia, a genetic disorder characterized by defective bone and/or tooth mineralization. To date, 275 ALPL mutations have been reported to cause hypophosphatasia, of which 204 were simple missense mutations. Molecular evolutionary analysis has proved to be an efficient method to highlight residues important for the protein function and to predict or validate sensitive positions for genetic disease. Here we analyzed 58 mammalian TNSALP to identify amino acids unchanged, or only substituted by residues sharing similar properties, through 220 millions years of mammalian evolution. We found 469 sensitive positions of the 524 residues of human TNSALP, which indicates a highly constrained protein. Any substitution occurring at one of these positions is predicted to lead to hypophosphatasia. We tested the 204 missense mutations resulting in hypophosphatasia against our predictive chart, and validated 99% of them. Most sensitive positions were located in functionally important regions of TNSALP (active site, homodimeric interface, crown domain, calcium site, …). However, some important positions are located in regions, the structure and/or biological function of which are still unknown. Our chart of sensitive positions in human TNSALP (i) enables to validate or invalidate at low cost any ALPL mutation, which would be suspected to be responsible for hypophosphatasia, by contrast with time consuming and expensive functional tests, and (ii) displays higher predictive power than in silico models of prediction. 
CFTR is a dynamically regulated anion channel. Intracellular WNK1-SPAK activation causes CFTR to change permeability and conductance characteristics from a chloride-preferring to bicarbonate-preferring channel through unknown mechanisms. Two severe CFTR mutations (CFTRsev) cause complete loss of CFTR function and result in cystic fibrosis (CF), a severe genetic disorder affecting sweat glands, nasal sinuses, lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, and male reproductive system. We hypothesize that those CFTR mutations that disrupt the WNK1-SPAK activation mechanisms cause a selective, bicarbonate defect in channel function (CFTRBD) affecting organs that utilize CFTR for bicarbonate secretion (e.g. the pancreas, nasal sinus, vas deferens) but do not cause typical CF. To understand the structural and functional requirements of the CFTR bicarbonate-preferring channel, we (a) screened 984 well-phenotyped pancreatitis cases for candidate CFTRBD mutations from among 81 previously described CFTR variants; (b) conducted electrophysiology studies on clones of variants found in pancreatitis but not CF; (c) computationally constructed a new, complete structural model of CFTR for molecular dynamics simulation of wild-type and mutant variants; and (d) tested the newly defined CFTRBD variants for disease in non-pancreas organs utilizing CFTR for bicarbonate secretion. Nine variants (CFTR R74Q, R75Q, R117H, R170H, L967S, L997F, D1152H, S1235R, and D1270N) not associated with typical CF were associated with pancreatitis (OR 1.5, p = 0.002). Clones expressed in HEK 293T cells had normal chloride but not bicarbonate permeability and conductance with WNK1-SPAK activation. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest physical restriction of the CFTR channel and altered dynamic channel regulation. Comparing pancreatitis patients and controls, CFTRBD increased risk for rhinosinusitis (OR 2.3, p<0.005) and male infertility (OR 395, p<<0.0001). WNK1-SPAK pathway-activated increases in CFTR bicarbonate permeability are altered by CFTRBD variants through multiple mechanisms. CFTRBD variants are associated with clinically significant disorders of the pancreas, sinuses, and male reproductive system. 
CYP2C19 (formerly known as CYP2C75), highly homologous to human CYP2C19, has been identified in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, non-human primate species widely used in drug metabolism studies. CYP2C19 is predominantly expressed in liver and encodes a functional drug-metabolizing enzyme. Genetic variants in human CYP2C genes account for the inter-individual variability in drug metabolism; however, genetic variants have not been investigated in macaque CYP2C19. In the present study, re-sequencing of CYP2C19 in 78 cynomolgus and 36 rhesus macaques identified 34 non-synonymous variants. Among these, 6 were located in substrate recognition sites, the domains important for protein function. Eighteen and 6 variants were unique to cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, respectively. Four variants were characterized by site-directed mutagenesis and metabolic assays, and 3 variants (p.Phe100Asn, p.Ala103Val, and p.Ile112Leu) showed substantially reduced activity as compared with wild type in flurbiprofen 4'-hydroxylation, omeprazole 5-hydroxylation, and R-/S-warfarin 7-hydroxylation. These variants, co-segregating in the animals analyzed, influenced metabolic activities because the homozygotes and/or heterozygotes showed significantly reduced catalytic activities in liver toward flurbiprofen 4'-hydroxylation and omeprazole 5-hydroxylation as compared with wild type. Kinetic analysis for R-warfarin 7-hydroxylation and docking simulation indicated that CYP2C19 Ala103Val would change the function and conformation of this enzyme. Ala103Val variation diminished homotropic cooperativity of CYP2C19 with R-warfarin yielding low metabolic capacity. These results indicated that the interindividual variability of CYP2C-dependent drug metabolism is at least partly accounted for by CYP2C19 variants in cynomolgus macaques. 
ABCD1 and ABCD2 are two closely related ATP-binding cassette half-transporters predicted to homodimerize and form peroxisomal importers for fatty acyl-CoAs. Available evidence has shown that ABCD1 and ABCD2 display a distinct but overlapping substrate specificity, although much remains to be learned in this respect as well as in their capability to form functional heterodimers. Using a cell model expressing an ABCD2-EGFP fusion protein, we first demonstrated by proximity ligation assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay that ABCD1 interacts with ABCD2. Next, we tested in the pxa1/pxa2Δ yeast mutant the functionality of ABCD1/ABCD2 dimers by expressing chimeric proteins mimicking homo- or heterodimers. For further structure-function analysis of ABCD1/ABCD2 dimers, we expressed chimeric dimers fused to enhanced GFP in human skin fibroblasts of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy patients. These cells are devoid of ABCD1 and accumulate very long-chain fatty acids (C26:0 and C26:1). We checked that the chimeric proteins were correctly expressed and targeted to the peroxisomes. Very long-chain fatty acid levels were partially restored in transfected X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy fibroblasts regardless of the chimeric construct used, thus demonstrating functionality of both homo- and heterodimers. Interestingly, the level of C24:6 n-3, the immediate precursor of docosahexaenoic acid, was decreased in cells expressing chimeric proteins containing at least one ABCD2 moiety. Our data demonstrate for the first time that both homo- and heterodimers of ABCD1 and ABCD2 are functionally active. Interestingly, the role of ABCD2 (in homo- and heterodimeric forms) in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids is clearly evidenced, and the chimeric dimers provide a novel tool to study substrate specificity of peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette transporters. 
SDHB mutation carriers are predisposed to developing paragangliomas (PGLs). The objective of this study was to assess genotype-phenotype correlations of a Dutch cohort of SDHB mutation carriers and assess potential differences in clinical phenotypes related to specific SDHB founder mutations. Forty-seven consecutive SDHB mutation carriers were included. Initial screening consisted of measurement of 24 h urinary excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites in duplicate, repeated annually if initial biochemical screening was negative. Whole-body imaging studies with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and/or (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy were performed in case of catecholamine excess, and MRI or CT scans of thorax, abdomen and pelvis were performed every 2 years regardless of catecholamine levels. Repetitive head-and-neck MRI was performed at 2 year intervals. Mean follow-up was 3.6 ± 3.6 years. Twenty-seven persons (57 %) carried the SDHB c.423+1 G>A mutation and seven persons (15 %) the SDHB c.201-4429_287-933del (exon 3 deletion) mutation. No differences were found in the clinical phenotype of carriers of these two specific SDHB mutations. By end of follow-up, 49 % of SDHB mutation carriers displayed no biochemical or radiological evidence of manifest disease, i.e. they were unaffected carriers. Three persons (6 %) had been diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma (PCC), four with a sympathetic PGL (sPGL) (9 %), 18 with a HNPGL (38 %), and two persons (4 %) had developed a malignant paraganglioma, i.e. metastatic disease. In conclusion, the two main Dutch SDHB founder mutations do not differ in clinical expression and result in a relatively mild phenotype. Over one-third of SDHB mutation carriers develop HNPGL, with sPGL/PCC in only 15 % and malignancy in only 4 %.
NME1 is a well-documented metastasis suppressor gene, with suppressor activity demonstrated across a wide spectrum of human cancers including melanoma and carcinomas of the breast, stomach and thyroid. A primary aim of the current study was to identify profiles of genes whose expression is regulated by NME1 in cell lines of melanoma and thyroid carcinoma origin. Impact of NME1 was determined by forcing its expression transiently in cell lines using a novel Ad5-based adenoviral vector (Ad5-NME1), followed 48 h later by analysis of RNA expression profiles using the U133A microarray chip. Robust NME1 expression was achieved following infection with the Ad5-NME1 adenovirus in the human metastasis-derived cell lines WM1158 (melanoma) and WRO82 (follicular thyroid carcinoma), resulting in wide-ranging effects on gene expression in both settings. A substantial proportion of the NME1-regulated genes identified in the analyses were of clear potential relevance to metastasis, such as matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), SERPINB9 and colony stimulating factor receptor-2B (CSFR2B). Nine genes were identified (false discovery rate <0.1) that were regulated by NME1 in both the WM1158 and WRO82 cell lines, each possessing one or more such metastasis-relevant activities as stress fiber formation and focal adhesion (PPM1E, ZYX, PFN1), chemotaxis (CCR1) epithelial-mesenchymal signaling (WNT6), differentiation and morphogenesis (TBX4, ZFP36L2), and G protein modulation (GPR52 and PFN1). In addition, a number of the NME1-regulated genes were shown to be of prognostic value for distant disease-free survival and overall survival in melanoma and breast cancer. The combined expression of three NME1-regulated genes CSFR2B, MSF4A1 and SERPINB9 provided a strongly synergistic correlation with distant disease-free survival in the basal subtype of breast cancer (p<3.5e(-5), hazard ratio=0.33). Our study demonstrates that analysis of NME1-dependent gene expression is a powerful approach for identifying potential modulators of metastatic potential in multiple cancer types, which in turn may represent useful therapeutic targets. The study also highlights NME1-dependent genes as potential prognostic/diagnostic indices, which are profoundly lacking at present in melanoma. 
TYR (Tyrosinase) and TYRP1 (Tyrosinase-related protein 1) play crucial roles in determining the coat color of birds. In this paper, we aimed to characterize the relationship of TYR and TYRP1 genes with plumage colors in Korean quails. The SNPs were searched by cDNA sequencing and PCR-SSCP in three plumage color Korean quails (maroon, white and black plumage). Two SNPs (367T→C and 1153C→T) were found in the coding region of TYRP1 gene, but had no significant association with plumage phenotype in Korean quails. The expression of TYR was higher in black plumage quails than that in maroon plumage quails. In contrast, the expression of TYRP1 was lower in black plumage quails than that in maroon plumage quails. This study suggested that the melanic plumage color in Korean quails may be associated with either increased production of TYR or decreased production of TYRP1. 
ABO blood group and risk of squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus have been reported by many studies, but there is no discipline that had provided association with the genotype and gene frequency by population statics.
OTC encodes ornithine carbamoyltransferase, mitochondrial matrix enzyme involved in the synthesis of urea. The tissue-specific expression of OTC in the liver and intestine is dependent on the interaction of OTC promoter with an upstream enhancer. HNF-4 and C/EBPβ are crucial for this interaction in the rat and mouse. In the present study we focused on characterization of elements involved in the regulation of OTC transcription in human. Using a set of 5'-deleted promoter mutants in a reporter assay we identified two positive cis-acting regulatory elements located at c.-105 and c.-136 within the human OTC promoter. Both are essential for the transcriptional activity of the promoter itself and for the interaction with the enhancer. Protein binding at the corresponding sites was confirmed by DNase I footprinting. Electromobility shift assay with a specific competitor and anti-HNF-4α antibody identified the DNA-protein binding sites as HNF-4α recognition motifs. A third HNF-4α binding site has been found at the position c.-187. All three HNF-4α binding sites are located within 35 bp upstream of the transcription start sites at positions c.-95, c.-119 (major) and c.-169 (minor). A series of C/EBPβ recognition motifs was identified within the enhancer. Involvement of C/EBPβ and HNF-4α in the promoter-enhancer interaction is further supported by a massive DNAprotein interaction observed in the footprinting and EMSA assays. Since the OTC promoter lacks general core promoter elements such as TATA-box or initiators in standard positions, HNF-4α most likely plays an essential role in the initiation of OTC transcription in human. 
CD38 is an ecto-enzyme that consumes NAD(+) to produce cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) --- a potent agonist of ryanodine receptors. Recent studies have suggested CD38 may play significant roles in both ischemic brain injury and traumatic brain injury, while the mechanisms underlying the roles of CD38 in neurological diseases remain unclear. Because oxidative stress plays key roles in both ischemic brain damage and traumatic brain damage, in this study we used primary astrocyte cultures as a experimental model to test our hypothesis that CD38 may play significant roles in oxidative stress-induced neural cell death. We found CD38 siRNA-produced decrease in CD38 levels can lead to a significant increase in H2O2-induced astrocyte death. Moreover, the CD38 siRNA treatment can significantly aggravate oxidative stress in the H2O2-treated cells, as indicated by increases in both superoxide and lipid peroxidation, suggesting that CD38 is required for maintaining the antioxidation capacity of the cells. We also found that H2O2 can induce increased CD38 expression. Collectively, our study has obtained novel findings suggesting that CD38 plays a significant role in both antioxidation and cell survival of reactive oxygen species-exposed primary astrocytes, suggesting that CD38 may become a novel target for decreasing the oxidative damage in neurological disorders. 
PDE2A is a dual-function PDE that is stimulated by cGMP to hydrolyze cAMP preferentially. In a two-hit model of ALI, we found previously that PDE2A decreased lung cAMP, up-regulated lung iNOS, and exacerbated ALI. Recent data suggest that macrophage iNOS expression contributes to ALI but later, promotes lung-injury resolution. However, macrophage iNOS is increased by cAMP, suggesting that PDE2A could negatively regulate macrophage iNOS expression. To test this, we examined the effects of manipulating PDE2A expression and function on LPS-induced iNOS expression in a mouse AM cell line (MH-S) and primary mouse AMs. In MH-S cells, LPS (100 ng/ml) increased PDE2A expression by 15% at 15 min and 50% at 6 h before decreasing at 24 h and 48 h. iNOS expression appeared at 6 h and remained increased 48 h post-LPS. Compared with control Ad, Ad.PDE2A-shRNA enhanced LPS-induced iNOS expression further by fourfold, an effect mimicked by the PDE2A inhibitor BAY 60-7550. Adenoviral PDE2A overexpression or treatment with ANP decreased LPS-induced iNOS expression. ANP-induced inhibition of iNOS was lost by knocking down PDE2A and was not mimicked by 8-pCPT-cGMP, a cGMP analog that does not stimulate PDE2A activity. Finally, we found that in primary AMs from LPS-treated mice, PDE2A knockdown also increased iNOS expression, consistent with the MH-S cell data. We conclude that increased AM PDE2A is an important negative regulator of macrophage iNOS expression.
COMT Val(158)Met moderates the effect of stress on psychotic symptoms. Exposure to stress is also associated with mesolimbic dopamine release in individuals experiencing low maternal care. We therefore test the hypothesis that recent stressful life events are associated with more severe positive symptoms (associated with mesolimbic dopamine release) in first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients who experienced low maternal care during childhood. We hypothesized that COMT Val(158)Met moderates this association. A total of 149 FEP patients recruited within the Psychosis Incident Cohort Outcome Study (PICOS) participated in the present study. Maternal care was assessed by the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), stressful life events were collected by the List of Events Scale and positive symptoms were assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). We found that low maternal care and recent stressful life events were associated with higher level of positive symptoms at the onset (analysis of variance [ANOVA], p = 0.012), and that patients who were also homozygotes for the COMT Val(158) allele had the highest level of positive symptoms (ANOVA, p = 0.024). Low maternal care and severe stressful life events may contribute to a symptomatology characterized by more severe positive symptoms at the onset, possibly due to an increased mesolimbic dopamine release. Homozygosity for the COMT Val(158) allele seems to confer a biological predisposition to the stress-related hyperactivity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. The data imply that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is involved in the mediation/modulation of the effect of stressful events on the vulnerability for psychosis.
PIGF is a protein involved in the ethanolamine phosphate (EtNP) transfer steps of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis. PIGF forms a heterodimer with either PIGG or PIGO, two enzymes that transfer an EtNP to the second or third mannoses of GPI respectively. Heterodimer formation is essential for stable and regulated expression of PIGO and PIGG, but the functional significance of PIGF remains obscure. In the present study, we show that PIGF binds to PIGO and PIGG through distinct molecular domains. Strikingly, C-terminal half of PIGF was sufficient for its binding to PIGO and PIGG and yet this truncation mutant could not complement the PIGF defective mutant cells, suggesting that heterodimer formation is not sufficient for PIGF function. Furthermore, we identified a highly conserved motif in PIGF and demonstrated that the motif is not involved in binding to PIGO or PIGG, but critical for its function. Finally, we identified a PIGF homologue from Trypanosoma brucei and showed that it binds specifically to the T. brucei PIGO homologue. These data together support the notion that PIGF plays a critical and evolutionary conserved role in the ethanolamine-phosphate transfer-step, which cannot be explained by its previously ascribed binding/stabilizing function. Potential roles of PIGF in GPI biosynthesis are discussed. 
CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the formation of the endogenous Ca(2+)-mobilizing messengers cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) for the activation of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) of sarcoplasmic reticulum and NAADP-sensitive Ca(2+) release channels in endolysosomes, respectively. It plays important roles in systemic vascular functions, but there is little information on CD38 in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Earlier studies suggested a redox-sensing role of CD38 in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. This study sought to characterize its roles in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced Ca(2+) release (AICR) in PASMCs. Examination of CD38 expression in various rat arteries found high levels of CD38 mRNA and protein in pulmonary arteries. The Ang II-elicited Ca(2+) response consisted of extracellular Ca(2+) influx and intracellular Ca(2+) release in PASMCs. AICR activated in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) was reduced by pharmacological or siRNA inhibition of CD38, by the cADPR antagonist 8-bromo-cADPR or ryanodine, and by the NAADP antagonist Ned-19 or disruption of endolysosomal Ca(2+) stores with the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1. Suppression of AICR by the inhibitions of cADPR- and NAADP-dependent pathways were nonadditive, indicating interdependence of RyR- and NAADP-gated Ca(2+) release. Furthermore, AICR was inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine, the nonspecific NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitors apocynin and diphenyleneiodonium, the NOX2-specific inhibitor gp91ds-tat, and the scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) tempol. These results provide the first evidence that Ang II activates CD38-dependent Ca(2+) release via the NOX2-ROS pathway in PASMCs.
PTEN plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia. Recently, we have shown that BCR-ABL promotes PTEN nuclear exclusion, through the modulation of HAUSP activity.
CYP1B1 is the most commonly mutated gene in primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), and mutations have also been identified in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). This study was undertaken to describe mutations in CYP1B1 in patients and families with PCG and POAG from Pakistan.
PFAS are man-made compounds that are highly spread in the environment. Human dietary exposure to such contaminants is of high concern as they may accumulate in the food chain. Different studies already demonstrated the importance of the fish consumption in the dietary exposure of these molecules and the potential increase of internal doses of PFAS following the consumption of PFAS. However, so far few study aimed to study the link between the consumption of fresh water fishes and the internal exposure to PFAS. Objectives of this study were (i) to estimate the internal exposure of populations that are potentially high consumers of fresh water fishes and (ii) to determine whether the consumption of fish caught from fresh water is a significant determinant of the internal exposure of PFAS. In this work, a large sample of adult freshwater anglers from the French metropolitan population (478 individuals) was constituted randomly from participants lists of anglers associations. Questionnaires provided social and demographic information and diet information for each subject. In addition, analyses of blood serum samples provided the internal concentration of 14 PFAS. The survey design allowed to extrapolate the data obtained on the 478 individuals to the freshwater angler population. Descriptive data regarding internal levels of PFAS were discussed at the population level, whereas identification of the determinants were done at the 478 individuals level as sufficient contrast was required in terms of fresh water fish consumption. Only molecules for which the detection frequency were above 80% in blood were considered, i.e., PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, PFNA, PFHpS, and PFDA. Distribution profiles showed log-normal distribution and PFOS and PFOA were the main contributors of the PFAS sum. For PFOS, the results obtained on the 478 individuals showed that upper percentiles were higher as compared to upper percentiles obtained on occidental general population. This confirmed an over-exposure of a fraction of the 478 individuals. Though, when the results were considered at the population level, the values were close. This was attributed to the low consumption frequency of fresh water fish in the general population. For PFOS, PFNA, PFHxS, PFHpS and PFDA, the fresh water fish consumption was identified as one of the contributors of internal PFAS concentrations. Gender, age, geographical location and consumption of home-grown products as other determinants were also discussed in this paper. 
CP is the most prevalent childhood condition associated with low bone mass. Bone density is decreased in children with CP who sustain fragility fractures that impair function and quality of life. Predicting accurately who is at risk for fracture, preventing or reversing low bone mass and maximizing bone accrual during critical stages of growth are essential to minimizing future lifelong risks of fractures. This review article addresses the diagnosis of low bone mass, the anatomy of bone, risk factors for low bone density and for the prevention and treatment for low bone mass for children with CP. 
PTEN regulates normal signaling through the B cell receptor (BCR). In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), enhanced BCR signaling contributes to increased B cell activity, but the role of PTEN in human SLE has remained unclear. We performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis in B cells from SLE patients and found that all SLE B cell subsets, except for memory B cells, showed decreased expression of PTEN compared with B cells from healthy controls. Moreover, the level of PTEN expression was inversely correlated with disease activity. We then explored the mechanisms governing PTEN regulation in SLE B cells. Notably, in normal but not SLE B cells, interleukin-21 (IL-21) induced PTEN expression and suppressed Akt phosphorylation induced by anti-immunoglobulin M and CD40L stimulation. However, this deficit was not primarily at the signaling or the transcriptional level, because IL-21-induced STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) phosphorylation was intact and IL-21 up-regulated PTEN mRNA in SLE B cells. Therefore, we examined the expression of candidate microRNAs (miRs) that could regulate PTEN: SLE B cells were found to express increased levels of miR-7, miR-21, and miR-22. These miRs down-regulated the expression of PTEN, and IL-21 stimulation increased the expression of miR-7 and miR-22 in both normal and SLE B cells. Indeed, a miR-7 antagomir corrected PTEN-related abnormalities in SLE B cells in a manner dependent on PTEN. Therefore, defective miR-7 regulation of PTEN contributes to B cell hyperresponsiveness in SLE and could be a new target of therapeutic intervention. 
CYP3A5 plays a prominent role in the metabolism of maraviroc, an approved drug for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 treatment and a candidate for HIV-1 prevention. We studied the effect of the CYP3A5 genotype on pharmacokinetics of maraviroc and a primary CYP3A5-dependent metabolite of maraviroc denoted as metabolite 1 (M1). Volunteers were screened for health status and CYP3A5 genotype (wild-type allele *1 and dysfunctional alleles *2, *3, *6, and *7) to obtain 24 evaluable subjects in three groups (n = 8 each): homozygous dysfunctional (two dysfunctional alleles), heterozygous (one *1 allele and one dysfunctional allele), and homozygous wild-type (two *1 alleles). Subjects received 300 mg maraviroc orally followed by blood collection for 32 hours. The homozygous wild-type group exhibited lower mean plasma maraviroc concentrations at almost all sampling times. The median (interquartile range) maraviroc area under the plasma concentration-time curves from time 0 to infinity (AUC0-inf) were 2099 (1422-2568) ng⋅h/ml, 1761 (931-2640) ng⋅h/ml, and 1238 (1065-1407) ng⋅h/ml for the homozygous dysfunctional, heterozygous, and homozygous wild-type groups, respectively. The homozygous wild-type group had 41% lower maraviroc AUC0-inf and 66% higher apparent clearance compared with the homozygous dysfunctional group (P = 0.02). The AUC0-inf ratios of maraviroc to M1 in heterozygous and homozygous wild-type subjects were lower by 51 and 64% relative to the homozygous dysfunctional group, respectively (P < 0.001). In conclusion, the lower maraviroc concentrations in the homozygous wild-type group indicate that maraviroc may be underdosed in people homozygous for the CYP3A5*1 allele, including almost one-half of African Americans. 
ABO fetomaternal red blood cell incompatibility (ABO FMI) induces an immune hemolysis after fetal transfer of hemolyzing maternal anti-A or anti-B. ABO hemolytic disease (ABO HD) remains the most frequent cause of severe and early jaundice in newborns. High levels of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia may induce acute and chronic neurological complications. Severe hyperbilirubinemia can be prevented by first-line phototherapy (PT) treatment, but exchange transfusion (ET) is required if treatment is not effective, even if ET is linked with high hemodynamic, infectious, gastrointestinal, and/or biological morbidity. Intravenous human polyclonal immunoglobulins (IVIg) have been proposed in concomitant use with PT in order to avoid the requirement for ET in ABO FMI.
NDST1 was recently proposed as a candidate gene for autosomal recessive intellectual disability in two families. It encodes a bifunctional GlcNAc N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase with important functions in heparan sulfate biosynthesis. In mice, Ndst1 is crucial for embryonic development and homozygous null mutations are perinatally lethal. We now report on two additional unrelated families with homozygous missense NDST1 mutations. All mutations described to date predict the substitution of conserved amino acids in the sulfotransferase domain, and mutation modeling predicts drastic alterations in the local protein conformation. Comparing the four families, we noticed significant overlap in the clinical features, including both demonstrated and apparent intellectual disability, muscular hypotonia, epilepsy, and postnatal growth deficiency. Furthermore, in Drosophila, knockdown of sulfateless, the NDST ortholog, impairs long-term memory, highlighting its function in cognition. Our data confirm NDST1 mutations as a cause of autosomal recessive intellectual disability with a distinctive phenotype, and support an important function of NDST1 in human development.
CYP1A1 and CYP2D6 are important genes encoding enzymes involved in the metabolism of toxic chemicals and carcinogens. However, inconclusive results for the association between CYP1A1 and CYP2D6 polymorphisms and the risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have been reported. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the association of CYP1A1 and CYP2D6 polymorphisms with the risk of HNSCC.
CYP2C9 is an important member of the cytochrome P450 enzyme superfamily, and 57 cytochrome P450 2C9 alleles have been previously reported. To examine the enzymatic activity of the CYP2C9 alleles, kinetic parameters for 4'-hydroxyflurbiprofen were determined using recombinant human P450s CYP2C9 microsomes from insect cells Sf21 carrying wild-type CYP2C9*1 and other variants. The results showed that the enzyme activity of most of the variants decreased comparing with the wild type as the previous studies reported, while the enzyme activity of some of them increased, which were not in accordance with the previous researches. Of the 36 tested CYP2C9 allelic isoforms, two variants (CYP2C9*53 and CYP2C9*56) showed a higher intrinsic clearance value than the wild-type protein, especially for CYP2C9*56, exhibited much higher intrinsic clearance (197.3%) relative to wild-type CYP2C9*1, while the remaining 33 CYP2C9 allelic isoforms exhibited significantly decreased clearance values (from 0.6 to 83.8%) compared to CYP2C9*1. This study provided the most comprehensive data on the enzymatic activities of all reported CYP2C9 variants in the Chinese population with regard to the commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, flurbiprofen (FP). The results indicated that most of the tested rare alleles decreased the catalytic activity of CYP2C9 variants toward FP hydroxylation in vitro. This is the first report of all these rare alleles for FP metabolism providing fundamental data for further clinical studies on CYP2C9 alleles for FP metabolism in vivo. 
PTEN is an essential tumour suppressor gene which encodes a phosphatase protein that antagonises the PI3K/Akt/mTOR antiapoptotic pathway. Impairment of this tumour suppressor pathway potentially becomes a causal factor for development of malignancies. This review aims to assess current understanding of mechanisms of dysfunction involving the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway linked to tumorigenesis and evaluate the evidence for targeted therapy directed at this signalling axis.
ACE inhibitors are first-line therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main adverse effects of ACE inhibitors are hypotension, renal function impairment and hyperkalemia.
PTEN is post-translationally modified by ubiquitin via association with multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases, including NEDD4-1, XIAP, and WWP2. Despite the rapid progress made in researching the impact of ubiquitination on PTEN function, our understanding remains fragmented. Building on the previously observed interaction between SIPL1 and PTEN, we report here that SIPL1 promotes PTEN polyubiquitination via lysine 48 (K48)-independent polyubiquitin chains. Substitution of the K48 residue of ubiquitin with arginine (R) enhanced SIPL1-mediated PTEN polyubiquitination. In contrast, the K63R substitution significantly reduced it. The ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain is required for SIPL1-induced PTEN polyubiquitination. This post-translational modification promoted the association of SIPL1 with PTEN. Elevated amounts of the SIPL1/PTEN complex were precipitated in 293T cells co-transfected with PTEN, SIPL1, and ubiquitin compared to cells co-transfected with SIPL1 and PTEN only. Additionally, formation of the SIPL1/PTEN complex was inhibited when either lysine-less (K0) ubiquitin or K63R ubiquitin was co-transfected together with SIPL1+PTEN. The PTEN component in the SIPL1/PTEN complex contained polyubiquitin chains. The ubiquitination reaction may play a structural role, stabilizing the SIPL1/PTEN complex, as a ubiquitin binding-defective SIPL1 mutant (TFLV) is proficient in PTEN association. Collectively, we demonstrate that SIPL1 binds PTEN and enhances PTEN polyubiquitination which in turn promotes the interaction between SIPL1 and PTEN. 
CD38 is a 45,000 molecular weight transmembrane protein that is expressed in immature and mature lymphocytes. However, the expression and function of CD38 during B-cell differentiation in mice is poorly understood. Here, we report that CD38 is expressed from the earliest stages of B-cell development. Pre-pro-B, pro-B, pre-B and immature B cells from murine bone marrow all stained positive for CD38. Interestingly, CD38 expression increases with B-cell maturation. To assess the role of CD38 during B-cell maturation, CD38-deficient mice were analysed. CD38(-/-) mice showed a significant increase in both the frequency of B-lineage cells and the absolute numbers of pre-pro-B cells in bone marrow; however, no other differences were observed at later stages. CD38 cross-linking in Ba/F3 cells promoted apoptosis and marked extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, and these effects were reduced by treatment with the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059, and similar effects were observed in B-cell precursors from bone marrow. These data demonstrate that B-cell precursors in mouse bone marrow express functional CD38 and implicate the early ligation of CD38 in the ERK-associated regulation of the B-lineage differentiation pathway.
CYP2C19 polymorphism modulates platelet reactivity in coronary artery disease patients with stent implants. However, the impact of the CYP2C19 genotype on clopidogrel response and clinical outcome has not been fully understood to date.
ABO sensitization is a barrier to ABO-incompatible heart transplantation in infants. We investigate the development of ABO antibodies in infants with and without mechanical circulatory support (MCS) during their waiting period. Although the proportion of patients with antibodies was similar between the groups, the median age at antibody detection was only 9 days (6-198) for MCS vs. 223 days (28-367) for non-MCS patients (P = 0.028), suggesting MCS is associated with earlier ABO antibody detection. 
ABCD3 is one of three ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters present in the peroxisomal membrane catalyzing ATP-dependent transport of substrates for metabolic pathways localized in peroxisomes. So far, the precise function of ABCD3 is not known. Here, we report the identification of the first patient with a defect of ABCD3. The patient presented with hepatosplenomegaly and severe liver disease and showed a striking accumulation of peroxisomal C27-bile acid intermediates in plasma. Investigation of peroxisomal parameters in skin fibroblasts revealed a reduced number of enlarged import-competent peroxisomes. Peroxisomal beta-oxidation of C26:0 was normal, but beta-oxidation of pristanic acid was reduced. Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous deletion at the DNA level of 1758bp, predicted to result in a truncated ABCD3 protein lacking the C-terminal 24 amino acids (p.Y635NfsX1). Liver disease progressed and the patient required liver transplantation at 4 years of age but expired shortly after transplantation. To corroborate our findings in the patient, we studied a previously generated Abcd3 knockout mouse model. Abcd3-/- mice accumulated the branched chain fatty acid phytanic acid after phytol loading. In addition, analysis of bile acids revealed a reduction of C24 bile acids, whereas C27-bile acid intermediates were significantly increased in liver, bile and intestine of Abcd3-/- mice. Thus, both in the patient and in Abcd3-/- mice, there was evidence of a bile acid biosynthesis defect. In conclusion, our studies show that ABCD3 is involved in transport of branched-chain fatty acids and C27 bile acids into the peroxisome and that this is a crucial step in bile acid biosynthesis. 
ACE (adverse childhood experience) studies typically examine the links between childhood stressors and adult health harming behaviours. Using an enhanced ACE survey methodology, we examine impacts of ACEs on non-communicable diseases and incorporate a proxy measure of premature mortality in England.
ABCC4 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family known to transport prostaglandin E2 and other molecules across cellular membranes. A mutation in ABCC4 is now shown to cause defects in ciliogenesis, revealing a role for prostaglandin signalling in regulating cilia dynamics. 
GNE myopathy is a rare autosomal recessive muscle disease caused by mutations in GNE, the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in sialic acid biosynthesis. GNE myopathy usually manifests in early adulthood with distal myopathy that progresses slowly and symmetrically, first involving distal muscles of the lower extremities, followed by proximal muscles with relative sparing of the quadriceps. Upper extremities are typically affected later in the disease. We report a patient with GNE myopathy who presented with asymmetric hand weakness. He had considerably decreased left grip strength, atrophy of the left anterior forearm and fibro-fatty tissue replacement of left forearm flexor muscles on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The patient was an endoscopist and thus the asymmetric hand involvement may be associated with left hand overuse in daily repetitive pinching and gripping movements, highlighting the possible impact of environmental factors on the progression of genetic muscle conditions. 
ABO blood group antigens are complex carbohydrate molecules expressed on red blood cells and a variety of tissues. The ABO blood type is implicated in the development of a number of human diseases and there is increasing evidence regarding its involvement in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders, mainly through its effect on von Willebrand factor levels. In this review, after a brief analysis of the potential molecular mechanisms by which the blood group influences haemostasis, we focus on the clinical implications of such interaction. Overall, the literature data document the close relationship between venous thromboembolism (VTE) and non-O blood type, which is associated with an approximately two-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis. A supra-additive effect on VTE risk is observed when an inherited thrombophilic condition is associated with non-O blood group. A weaker association exists between non-O blood type and arterial thrombosis, which needs to be further investigated. 
PIK3CA mutations represent one of the most common genetic aberrations in breast cancer. They have been reported to be present in over one-third of cases, with enrichment in the luminal and in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive subtypes. Substantial preclinical data on the oncogenic properties of these mutations have been reported. However, whilst the preclinical data have clearly shown an association with robust activation of the pathway and resistance to common therapies used in breast cancer, the clinical data reported up to now do not support that the PIK3CA mutated genotype is associated with high levels of pathway activation or with a poor prognosis. We speculate that this may be due to the minimal use of transgenic mice models thus far. In this review, we discuss both the preclinical and clinical data associated with PIK3CA mutations and their potential implications. Prospective clinical trials stratifying by PIK3CA genotype will be necessary to determine if the mutation also predicts for increased sensitivity to agents targeting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway. 
ALOX5 is implicated in chronic myeloid leukemia development in mouse leukemic stem cells, but its importance in human chronic myeloid leukemia is unknown. Functional ALOX5 was assessed using an LTB4 ELISA and ALOX5, and LTB4R1 mRNA expression was determined via a TaqMan gene expression assay. LTB4R1 and 5-LOX protein levels were assessed by cell surface flow cytometry analysis. At diagnosis ALOX5 was below normal in both blood and CD34(+) stem cells in all patients. On treatment initiation, ALOX5 levels increased in all patients except those who were destined to progress subsequently to blast crisis. LTB4 levels were increased despite low ALOX5 expression, suggesting that the arachidonic acid pathway is functioning normally up to the point of LTB4 production. However, the LTB4 receptor (BLT1) protein in newly diagnosed patients was significantly lower than after a period of treatment (P<0.0001). The low level of LTB4R1 at diagnosis explains the downregulation of ALOX5. In the absence of LTB4R1, the arachidonic acid pathway intermediates (5-HEPTE and LTA4) negatively regulate ALOX5. ALOX5 regulation is aberrant in chronic myeloid leukemia patients and may not be important for the development of the disease. Our data suggest caution when extrapolating mouse model data into human chronic myeloid leukemia. 
RPE is increasingly being considered as a viable tool beyond its original use for monitoring in-task exercise intensity. Research indicates that anticipated, in-task, and postexercise RPE values are often notably different from one another. An important new consideration is how perceptions are impacted by high-intensity interval training (HIT). This study aims to compare RPE responses before, during, and after continuous and HIT exercise trials.
ABCA1 mediates the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids into apoA-I to form HDL, which is important in the prevention of atherosclerosis. To develop a novel method for the evaluation of HDL formation, we prepared an apoA-I-POLARIC by labeling the specific residue of an apoA-I variant with a hydrophobicity-sensitive fluorescence probe that detects the environmental change around apoA-I during HDL formation. apoA-I-POLARIC possesses the intact ABCA1-dependent HDL formation activity and shows 4.0-fold higher fluorescence intensity in HDL particles than in the lipid-free state. Incubation of apoA-I-POLARIC with ABCA1-expressing cells, but not ABCA1-non-expressing cells, caused a 1.7-fold increase in fluorescence intensity. Gel filtration analysis demonstrated that the increase in fluorescence intensity of apoA-I-POLARIC represents the amount of apoA-I incorporated into the discoidal HDL particles rather than the amount of secreted cholesterol. THP-1 macrophage-mediated HDL formation and inhibition of HDL formation by cyclosporine A could also be measured using apoA-I-POLARIC. Furthermore, HDL formation-independent lipid release induced by microparticle formation or cell death was not detected by apoA-I-POLARIC. These results demonstrate that HDL formation by ABCA1-expressing cells can be specifically detected by sensing hydrophobicity change in apoA-I, thus providing a novel method for assessing HDL formation and screening of the HDL formation modulator. 
CYP2E1 PstI polymorphism G-1259C (rs3813867) genotype distributions vary significantly among different populations and are associated with both diseases, like cancer, and adverse drug effects. To date, there have been limited genotype distributions and allele frequencies of this polymorphism reported in the three major indigenous ethnic groups (KadazanDusun, Bajau, and Rungus) in Sabah, also known as North Borneo. The aim of this study was to investigate the genotype distributions and allele frequencies of the CYP2E1 PstI polymorphism G-1259C in these three major indigenous peoples in Sabah. A total of 640 healthy individuals from the three dominant indigenous groups were recruited for this study. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) at G-1259C polymorphic site of CYP2E1 gene was performed using the Pst I restriction enzyme. Fragments were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis and confirmed by direct sequencing. Overall, the allele frequencies were 90.3% for c1 allele and 9.7% for c2 allele. The genotype frequencies for c1/c1, c1/c2 and c2/c2 were observed as 80.9%, 18.8%, and 0.3%, respectively. A highly statistical significant difference (p<0.001) was observed in the genotype distributions between indigenous groups in Sabah with all Asian and non-Asian populations. However, among these three indigenous groups, there was no statistical significant difference (p>0.001) in their genotype distributions. The three major indigenous ethnic groups in Sabah show unique genotype distributions when compared with other populations. This finding indicates the importance of establishing the genotype distributions of CYP2E1 PstI polymorphism in the indigenous populations. 
GNE (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase) is a bifunctional enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to ManNAc and ManNAc to ManNAc 6-phosphate, key steps in the sialic acid biosynthesis. Mutations in GNE lead to a neuromuscular disorder, Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy (HIBM). A major limitation in understanding the function of GNE is lack of recombinant full length GNE (rGNE) protein for detailed biophysical and structural characterization. In the present study, we have used Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd) as an alternate host for successful expression and secretion of functionally active form of GNE and its mutant proteins. We have generated Dd-AX3 stable cell lines harboring wtGNE or its mutants with Dd specific secretory signal sequence, PsA (prespore antigen). Upon starvation, rGNE was secreted in the medium from secretory vesicles. The rGNE was functionally active with epimerase activity (54±5.2 mU/mg) and kinase activity (66.45±3.48 mU/mg), while both epimerase and kinase activities of mutant GNE were drastically reduced. These activities were found to be statistically significant at p value < 0.05. Our study clearly demonstrates that Dd can be used as an expression host for the production of recombinant and functionally active form of GNE and its mutant proteins that can be used for biophysical characterization and structural determination of GNE to understand the pathomechanism of HIBM.
ACE inhibitors (ACEI) are underutilised despite cardiovascular benefits, in part due to concerns of known transient elevations in serum creatinine (SCr) after initiation. Our objectives were to evaluate rates and predictors of ACEI discontinuation after SCr elevation post-ACEI initiation since limited data are available that examine this issue.
PTEN is a dual lipid/protein phosphatase, downregulated in steatotic livers with obesity or HCV infection. Liver-specific PTEN knockout (LPTEN KO) mice develop steatosis, inflammation/fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma with aging, but surprisingly also enhanced glucose tolerance. This study aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which hepatic PTEN deficiency improves glucose tolerance, while promoting fatty liver diseases.
STS (soft tissue sarcomas) are rare malignant tumours deriving from cells of mesenchymal origin and represent only 1% of all malignant neoplasms. It has been extensively demonstrated that angiogenesis has an important role in cancer malignancy. Particularly, a lot of studies demonstrate the importance of angiogenesis in the development of carcinomas, whereas little is known about the role of angiogenesis in sarcomas and especially in STS. This review aims at summarizing the new discoveries about the nature and the importance of angiogenesis in STS and the new possible therapeutic strategies involved. Only a few studies concerning STS focus on tumour neovascularization and proangiogenic factors and look for a correlation with the patients prognosis/survival. These studies demonstrate that intratumoural MVD (microvessels density) may not accurately represent the angiogenic capacity of STS. Nevertheless, this does not exclude the possibility that angiogenesis could be important in STS. The importance of neoangiogenesis in soft tissue tumours is confirmed by the arising number of publications comparing angiogenesis mediators with clinical features of patients with STS. The efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapies in other types of cancer is well documented. The understanding of the involvement of the angiogenic process in STS, together with the necessity to improve the therapy for this often mortal condition, prompted the exploration of anti-tumour compounds targeting this pathway. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the importance to better understand the mechanisms of angiogenesis in STS in order to subsequently design-specific target therapies for this group of poorly responding tumours. 
INPP4B and PTEN dual specificity phosphatases are frequently lost during progression of prostate cancer to metastatic disease. We and others have previously shown that loss of INPP4B expression correlates with poor prognosis in multiple malignancies and with metastatic spread in prostate cancer.
HIBCH (3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase) deficiency (MIM #250620) is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism, leading to a block in the catabolic pathway of the amino acid valine and presumably to accumulation of toxic valine metabolites in mitochondria. Only three families with HIBCH deficiency and biallelic HIBCH mutations have been described. We report on a further patient, first child of healthy consanguineous parents, with severe developmental delay, seizures, hyperintensities of the basal ganglia on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), progressive brain atrophy, optic nerve atrophy, repeatedly elevated blood lactate, and respiratory chain complexes I, I + III and cytochrome c oxidase deficiencies with borderline depletion of mitochondrial DNA in muscle tissue. Laboratory findings in blood and skeletal muscle were inconsistent and did not allow a definite diagnosis, but supported the hypothesis of mitochondrial dysfunction. Homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing revealed a homozygous one-base pair insertion in HIBCH. Deficiency of enzyme activity was confirmed in cultured fibroblasts. Although relatively unspecific, the clinical features were similar to those of the previously reported cases. Given the clinical variability and large number of differential diagnoses, the prevalence of HIBCH deficiency is probably underestimated. Next-generation sequencing approaches are an effective tool for identifying the underlying genetic basis in patients suspected of mitochondrial disorders.
LOXL2 (lysyl oxidase-like 2), an enzyme that catalyzes oxidative deamination of lysine residue, is upregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). A LOXL2 splice variant LOXL2-e13 and its wild type were overexpressed in ESCC cells followed by microarray analyses. In this study, we explored the potential role and molecular mechanism of LOXL2-e13 based on known protein-protein interactions (PPIs), following microarray analysis of KYSE150 ESCC cells overexpressing a LOXL2 splice variant, denoted by LOXL2-e13, or its wild-type counterpart. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of LOXL2-WT and LOXL2-e13 were applied to generate individual PPI subnetworks in which hundreds of DEGs interacted with thousands of other proteins. These two DEG groups were annotated by Functional Annotation Chart analysis in the DAVID bioinformatics database and compared. These results found many specific annotations indicating the potential specific role or mechanism for LOXL2-e13. The DEGs of LOXL2-e13, comparing to its wild type, were prioritized by the Random Walk with Restart algorithm. Several tumor-related genes such as ERO1L, ITGA3, and MAPK8 were found closest to LOXL2-e13. These results provide helpful information for subsequent experimental identification of the specific biological roles and molecular mechanisms of LOXL2-e13. Our study also provides a work flow to identify potential roles of splice variants with large scale data. 
GNE myopathy is an autosomal recessive muscular disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding the key enzyme in sialic acid biosynthesis, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE/MNK). Here, we report two siblings with myopathy with rimmed vacuoles and congenital thrombocytopenia who harbored two compound heterozygous GNE mutations, p.V603L and p.G739S. Thrombocytopenia, which is characterized by shortened platelet lifetime rather than ineffective thrombopoiesis, has been observed since infancy. We performed exome sequencing and array CGH to identify the underlying genetic etiology of thrombocytopenia. No pathogenic variants were detected among the known causative genes of recessively inherited thrombocytopenia; yet, candidate variants in two genes that followed an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, including previously identified GNE mutations, were detected. Alternatively, it is possible that the decreased activity of GNE/MNK itself, which would lead to decreased sialic content in platelets, is associated with thrombocytopenia in these patients. Further investigations are required to clarify the association between GNE myopathy and the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia. 
CYP1B1 is the most commonly mutated gene in primary congenital glaucoma (PCG). This study was undertaken to identify mutations in CYP1B1 in the Western region of Saudi Arabia.
CYP3A4 has an important role in the metabolisms of many drugs used in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy; still, there are practically no publications about the role of CYP3A4 polymorphisms in ALL pharmacogenomics. We genotyped eight common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes in 511 children with ALL and investigated whether they influenced the survival of the patients. We involved additional 127 SNPs in 34 candidate genes and searched for interactions with respect to the survival rates. Significant association between the survival rates and the common rs2246709 SNP in the CYP3A4 gene was observed. The gender of the patients and the rs1076991 in the MTHFD1 gene strongly influenced this effect. We calculated new risk assessments involving the gender-rs2246709 interaction and showed that they significantly outperformed the earlier risk-group assessments at every time point. If this finding is confirmed in other populations, it can have a considerable prognostic significance. 
ABO blood type is one of the most readily available laboratory tests, and serves as a vital determinant in blood transfusion and organ transplantation. The ABO antigens are expressed not only on red blood cell membranes, determining the compatibility of transfusion, but also on the surface of other human cells, including epithelium, platelet and vascular endothelium, therefore extending the research into other involvements of cardiovascular disease and postoperative outcomes. ABO blood group has been recognized as a risk factor of venous thrombosis embolism since the 1960's, effects now understood to be related to ABO dependent variations are procoagulant factor VIII (FVIII) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels. Levels of vWF, mostly genetically determined, are strongly associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE). It mediates platelet adhesion aggregation and stabilizes FVIII in plasma. Moreover, many studies have tried to identify the relationship between ABO blood types and ischemic heart disease. Unlike the clear and convincing associations between VTE and ABO blood type, the link between ABO blood type and ischemic heart disease is less consistent and may be confusing. Other than genetic factors, ischemic heart disease is strongly related to diet, race, lipid metabolism and economic status. In this review, we'll summarize the data relating race and genetics, including ABO blood type, to VTE, ischemic heart disease and postoperative bleeding after cardiac surgery. 
PIK3R1 (p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K) is frequently mutated across cancer lineages. Herein, we demonstrate that the most common recurrent PIK3R1 mutation PIK3R1(R348∗) and a nearby mutation PIK3R1(L370fs), in contrast to wild-type and mutations in other regions of PIK3R1, confers an unexpected sensitivity to MEK and JNK inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with the response to inhibitors, PIK3R1(R348∗) and PIK3R1(L370fs) unexpectedly increase JNK and ERK phosphorylation. Surprisingly, p85α R348(∗) and L370fs localize to the nucleus where the mutants provide a scaffold for multiple JNK pathway components facilitating nuclear JNK pathway activation. Our findings uncover an unexpected neomorphic role for PIK3R1(R348∗) and neighboring truncation mutations in cellular signaling, providing a rationale for therapeutic targeting of these mutant tumors. 
PTEN is a tumor suppressor associated with an inherited cancer syndrome and an important regulator of ongoing neural connectivity and plasticity. The present study examined molecular and phenotypic characteristics of individuals with germline heterozygous PTEN mutations and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (PTEN-ASD), with the aim of identifying pathophysiologic markers that specifically associate with PTEN-ASD and that may serve as targets for future treatment trials. PTEN-ASD patients (n=17) were compared with idiopathic (non-PTEN) ASD patients with (macro-ASD, n=16) and without macrocephaly (normo-ASD, n=38) and healthy controls (n=14). Group differences were evaluated for PTEN pathway protein expression levels, global and regional structural brain volumes and cortical thickness measures, neurocognition and adaptive behavior. RNA expression patterns and brain characteristics of a murine model of Pten mislocalization were used to further evaluate abnormalities observed in human PTEN-ASD patients. PTEN-ASD had a high proportion of missense mutations and showed reduced PTEN protein levels. Compared with the other groups, prominent white-matter and cognitive abnormalities were specifically associated with PTEN-ASD patients, with strong reductions in processing speed and working memory. White-matter abnormalities mediated the relationship between PTEN protein reductions and reduced cognitive ability. The Pten(m3m4) murine model had differential expression of genes related to myelination and increased corpus callosum. Processing speed and working memory deficits and white-matter abnormalities may serve as useful features that signal clinicians that PTEN is etiologic and prompting referral to genetic professionals for gene testing, genetic counseling and cancer risk management; and could reveal treatment targets in trials of treatments for PTEN-ASD. 
GNE myopathy is a slowly progressive autosomal recessive myopathy caused by mutations in the GNE (glucosamine (UDP-N-acetyl)-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase) gene. This study aimed to (1) develop a nationwide patient registry for GNE myopathy in order to facilitate the planning of clinical trials and recruitment of candidates, and (2) gain further insight into the disease for the purpose of improving therapy and care.
CYP1A1 bioactivates several procarcinogens and detoxifies several xenobiotic compounds. Transcription of CYP1A1 is highly induced by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. We recently described an RNAi high throughput screening performed in the Hepa-1 mouse hepatoma cell line, which revealed that SIN3A is necessary for the induction of CYP1A1-dependent ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD) enzymatic activity by TCDD. In the current studies, we sought to provide insight into the role of SIN3A in this process, particularly because studies on SIN3A have usually focused on its repressive activity on transcription. We report that ectopic expression of human SIN3A in Hepa-1 cells enhanced EROD induction by TCDD and efficiently rescued TCDD induction of EROD activity in cells treated with an siRNA to mouse SIN3A, thus validating a role for SIN3A in CYP1A1 induction. We demonstrate that SIN3A is required for TCDD induction of the CYP1A1 protein in Hepa-1 cells but not for expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor protein. In addition, siRNAs for SIN3A decreased TCDD-mediated induction of CYP1A1 mRNA and EROD activity in human hepatoma cell line Hep3B. We establish that TCDD treatment of Hepa-1 cells rapidly increases the degree of SIN3A binding to both the proximal promoter and enhancer of the Cyp1a1 gene and demonstrate that increased binding to the promoter also occurs in human Hep3B, HepG2, and MCF-7 cells. These studies establish that SIN3A physically interacts with the CYP1A1 gene and extends the transcriptional role of SIN3A to a gene that is very rapidly and dramatically induced. 
OCRL mutations are associated with both Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease, two rare X-linked conditions. Lowe syndrome is an oculo-cerebro-renal disorder, whereas Dent-2 patients mainly present renal proximal tubulopathy. Loss of OCRL-1, a phosphoinositide-5-phosphatase, leads in Lowe patients' fibroblasts to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) accumulation, with defects in F-actin network, α-actinin distribution and ciliogenesis, whereas fibroblasts of Dent-2 patients are still uncharacterized. To search for mechanisms linked to clinical variability observed between these two OCRL mutation-associated pathologies, we compared dermal fibroblasts from independent patients, four affected by Dent-2 disease and six with Lowe syndrome. For the first time, we describe that Dent-2 fibroblasts with OCRL loss-of-function (LOF) mutations exhibit decrease in actin stress fibers, appearance of punctate α-actinin signals and alteration in primary cilia formation. Interestingly, we quantified these phenotypes as clearly intermediate between Lowe and control fibroblasts, thus suggesting that levels of these defects correlate with clinical variations observed between patients with OCRL mutations. In addition, we show that Lowe and Dent-2 fibroblasts display similar PI(4,5)P2 accumulation levels. Finally, we analyzed INPP5B, a paralogous gene already reported to exhibit functional redundancy with OCRL, and report neither differences in its expression at RNA or protein levels, nor specific allelic variations between fibroblasts of patients. Altogether, we describe here differential phenotypes between fibroblasts from Lowe and Dent-2 patients, both associated with OCRL LOF mutations, we exclude direct roles of PI(4,5)P2 and INPP5B in this phenotypic variability and we underline potential key alterations leading to ocular and neurological clinical features in Lowe syndrome. 
CD36 is a scavenger receptor which has been studied closely in mammals where it is expressed by many different cell types and plays a role in highly diverse processes, both homeostatic and pathologic. It is among other things important in the innate immune system, in angiogenesis, and in clearance of apoptotic cells, and it is also involved in lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis. Recently, in the cephalochordate amphioxus a primitive CD36 family member was described, which was present before the divergence of CD36 from other scavenger receptor B family members, SCARB1 and SCARB2. Not much is known on the Cd36 molecule in teleost fish. We therefore studied Cd36 in both zebrafish and common carp, two closely related cyprinid fish species. Whereas a single cd36 gene is present in zebrafish, carp has two cd36 genes, and all show conserved synteny compared to mammalian CD36. The gene expression of carp cd36 is high in brain, ovary and testis but absent in immune organs. Although in mammals CD36 expression in erythrocytes, monocytes and macrophages is high, gene expression studies in leukocyte subtypes of adult carp and zebrafish larvae, including thrombocytes and macrophages provided no indication for any substantial expression of cd36 in immune cell types. Surprisingly, analysis of the cd36 promoter region does show the presence of several binding sites for transcription factors known to regulate immune responses. Overexpression of carp cd36 locates the receptor on the cell surface of mammalian cell lines consistent with the predicted topology of cyprinid Cd36 with a large extracellular domain, two transmembrane domains, and short cytoplasmic tails at both ends. Gene expression of cd36 is down-regulated during infection of zebrafish with Mycobacterium marinum, whereas knockdown of cd36 in zebrafish larvae led to higher bacterial burden upon such infection. We discuss the putative role for Cd36 in immune responses of fish in the context of other members of the scavenger receptor class B family. 
PTEN mutation is a frequent feature across a plethora of human cancers, the hot-spot being its C-terminus (PTEN-CT) regulatory domain resulting in a much diminished protein expression. In this study, the presence of C-terminus mutations was confirmed through sequencing of different human tumor samples. The kinase CKII-mediated phosphorylation of PTEN at these sites makes it a loopy structure competing with the E3 ligases for binding to its lipid anchoring C2 domain. Accordingly, it was found that PTEN-CT expressing stable cell lines could inhibit tumorigenesis in syngenic breast tumor models. Therefore, we designed a novel exosome-mediated delivery of the intrinsic PTEN domain, PTEN-CT into different cancer cells and observed reduced proliferation, migration, and colony forming ability. The delivery of exosome containing PTEN-CT to breast tumor mice model was found to result in significant regression in tumor size with the tumor sections showing increased apoptosis. Here, we also report for the first time an active PTEN when its C2 domain is bound by PTEN-CT, probably rendering its anti-tumorigenic activities through the protein phosphatase activity. Therefore, therapeutic interventions that focus on PTEN E3 ligase inhibition through exosome-mediated PTEN-CT delivery can be a probable route in treating cancers with low PTEN expression. 
CD36 is a multifunctional membrane receptor and is expressed in several cell lines. Individuals who lack platelet (PLT) CD36 are at risk for immunization against this antigen, leading to several clinical syndromes. This study aimed to investigate the frequency and molecular basis of CD36 deficiency in Shanghai.
CYP3A4 is a major cytochrome P450. It catalyses a broad range of substrates including xenobiotics such as clinically used drugs and endogenous compounds bile acids. Its function to detoxify bile acids could be used for treating cholestasis, which is a condition characterised by accumulation of bile acids. Although bile acids have important physiological functions, they are very toxic when their concentrations are excessively high. The accumulated bile acids in cholestasis can cause liver and other tissue injuries. Thus, control of the concentrations of bile acids is critical for treatment of cholestasis. CYP3A4 is responsively upregulated in cholestasis mediated by the nuclear receptors farnesol X receptor (FXR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) as a defence mechanism. However, the regulation of CYP3A4 is complicated by estrogen, which is increased in cholestasis and down regulates CYP3A4 expression. The activity of CYP3A4 is also inhibited by accumulated bile acids due to their property of detergent effect. In some cholestasis cases, genetic polymorphisms of the CYP3A4 and PXR genes may interfere with the adaptive response. Further stimulation of CYP3A4 activity in cholestasis could be an effective approach for treatment of the disease. In this review, we summarise recent progress about the roles of CYP3A4 in the metabolism of bile acids, its regulation and possible implication in the treatment of cholestasis. 
CLC channels and transporters are expressed in most tissues and fulfill diverse functions. There are four human CLC channels, ClC-1, ClC-2, ClC-Ka, and ClC-Kb, and five CLC transporters, ClC-3 through -7. Some of the CLC channels additionally associate with accessory subunits. Whereas barttin is mandatory for the functional expression of ClC-K, GlialCam is a facultative subunit of ClC-2 which modifies gating and thus increases the functional variability within the CLC family. Isoform-specific ion conduction and gating properties optimize distinct CLC channels for their cellular tasks. ClC-1 preferentially conducts at negative voltages, and the resulting inward rectification provides a large resting chloride conductance without interference with the muscle action potential. Exclusive opening at voltages negative to the chloride reversal potential allows for ClC-2 to regulate intracellular chloride concentrations. ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb are equally suited for inward and outward currents to support transcellular chloride fluxes. Every human CLC channel gene has been linked to a genetic disease, and studying these mutations has provided much information about the physiological roles and the molecular basis of CLC channel function. Mutations in the gene encoding ClC-1 cause myotonia congenita, a disease characterized by sarcolemmal hyperexcitability and muscle stiffness. Loss-of-function of ClC-Kb/barttin channels impairs NaCl resorption in the limb of Henle and causes hyponatriaemia, hypovolemia and hypotension in patients suffering from Bartter syndrome. Mutations in CLCN2 were found in patients with CNS disorders but the functional role of this isoform is still not understood. Recent links between ClC-1 and epilepsy and ClC-Ka and heart failure suggested novel cellular functions of these proteins. This review aims to survey the knowledge about physiological and pathophysiological functions of human CLC channels in the light of recent discoveries from biophysical, physiological, and genetic studies. 
ABCA1 mediates the secretion of cellular free cholesterol and phospholipids to an extracellular acceptor, apolipoprotein AI, to form nascent high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Thus, ABCA1 is a key molecule in cholesterol homeostasis. Functional studies of certain Tangier disease mutations demonstrate that ABCA1 has multiple activities, including plasma membrane remodeling and apoAI binding to cell surface, which participate in nascent HDL biogenesis. Recent advances in our understanding of ABCA1 have demonstrated that ABCA1also mediates unfolding the N terminus of apoAI on the cell surface, followed by lipidation of apoAI and release of nascent HDL. Although ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to apoAI can occur on the plasma membrane, the role of apoAI retroendocytosis during cholesterol efflux may play a role in macrophage foam cells that store cholesterol esters in cytoplasmic lipid droplets.
PTEN mutations are the most common genetic alterations in endometrial cancer. Loss of PTEN and subsequent AKT activation stimulate estrogen receptor α-dependent pathways that play an important role in endometrial tumorigenesis. The major pathologic phenomenon of endometrial cancer is the loss of ovarian steroid hormone control over uterine epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, the precise mechanism of PTEN/AKT signaling in endometrial cancer remains poorly understood. The progesterone signaling mediator MIG-6 suppresses estrogen signaling and it has been implicated previously as a tumor suppressor in endometrial cancer. In this study, we show that MIG-6 also acts as a tumor suppressor in endometrial cancers associated with PTEN deficiency. Transgenic mice, where Mig-6 was overexpressed in progesterone receptor-expressing cells, exhibited a relative reduction in uterine tumorigenesis caused by Pten deficiency. ERK1/2 was phosphorylated in uterine tumors and administration of an ERK1/2 inhibitor suppressed cancer progression in PR(cre/+)Pten(f/f) mice. In clinical specimens of endometrial cancer, MIG-6 expression correlated inversely with ERK1/2 phosphorylation during progression. Taken together, our findings suggest that Mig-6 regulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation and that it is crucial for progression of PTEN-mutant endometrial cancers, providing a mechanistic rationale for the evaluation of ERK1/2 inhibitors as a therapeutic treatment in human endometrial cancer.
ABCG5 (G5) and ABCG8 (G8) form a sterol transporter that acts in liver and intestine to prevent accumulation of dietary sterols. Mutations in either G5 or G8 cause sitosterolemia, a recessive disorder characterized by sterol accumulation and premature coronary atherosclerosis. Hepatic G5G8 mediates cholesterol excretion into bile, but the function and relative importance of intestinal G5G8 has not been defined. To determine the role of intestinal G5G8, we developed liver-specific (L-G5G8(-/-)), intestine-specific (I-G5G8(-/-)), and total (G5G8(-/-)) KO mice. Tissue levels of sitosterol, the most abundant plant sterol, were >90-fold higher in G5G8(-/-) mice than in WT animals. Expression of G5G8 only in intestine or only in liver decreased tissue sterol levels by 90% when compared with G5G8(-/-) animals. Biliary sterol secretion was reduced in L-G5G8(-/-) and G5G8(-/-) mice, but not in I-G5G8(-/-) mice. Conversely, absorption of plant sterols was increased in I-G5G8(-/-) and G5G8(-/-) mice, but not in L-G5G8(-/-) mice. Reverse cholesterol transport, as assessed from the fraction of intravenously administered (3)H-cholesterol that appeared in feces, was reduced in G5G8(-/-), I-G5G8(-/-), and L-G5G8(-/-) mice. Thus, G5G8 expression in both the liver and intestine protects animals from sterol accumulation, and intestinal G5G8 contributes to extrahepatic cholesterol efflux in mice. 
CFTR is a cAMP-activated chloride and bicarbonate channel that is critical for lung homeostasis. Decreases in CFTR expression have dire consequences in cystic fibrosis (CF) and have been suggested to be a component of the lung pathology in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Decreases or loss of channel function often lead to mucus stasis, chronic bacterial infections, and the accompanying chronic inflammatory responses that promote progressive lung destruction, and, eventually in CF, lung failure. Here we discuss CFTR's functional role airway surface liquid hydration and pH, in regulation of other channels such as the epithelial sodium channel, and in regulating inflammatory responses in the lung. 
CYP2D6 metabolizes nearly 25% of clinically used drugs. Genetic polymorphisms cause large inter-individual variability in CYP2D6 enzyme activity and are currently used as biomarker to predict CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype. Previously, we had identified a region 115 kb downstream of CYP2D6 as enhancer for CYP2D6, containing two completely linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs133333 and rs5758550, associated with enhanced transcription. However, the enhancer effect on CYP2D6 expression, and the causative variant, remained to be ascertained. To characterize the CYP2D6 enhancer element, we applied chromatin conformation capture combined with the next-generation sequencing (4C assays) and chromatin immunoprecipitation with P300 antibody, in HepG2 and human primary culture hepatocytes. The results confirmed the role of the previously identified enhancer region in CYP2D6 expression, expanding the number of candidate variants to three highly linked SNPs (rs133333, rs5758550 and rs4822082). Among these, only rs5758550 demonstrated regulating enhancer activity in a reporter gene assay. Use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats mediated genome editing in HepG2 cells targeting suspected enhancer regions decreased CYP2D6 mRNA expression by 70%, only upon deletion of the rs5758550 region. These results demonstrate robust effects of both the enhancer element and SNP rs5758550 on CYP2D6 expression, supporting consideration of rs5758550 for CYP2D6 genotyping panels to yield more accurate phenotype prediction. 
ABO incompatible living donor renal transplantation (ABOi) can achieve outcomes comparable to ABO compatible transplantation (ABOc). However, with the exception of blood group A2 kidneys transplanted into recipients with low titer anti-A antibody, regimens generally include antibody removal, intensified immunosuppression and splenectomy or rituximab. We now report a series of 20 successful renal transplants across a range of blood group incompatibilities using conventional immunosuppression alone in recipients with low baseline anti-blood group antibody (ABGAb) titers. Incompatibilities were A1 to O (3), A1 to B (2), A2 to O (2), AB to A (2), AB to B (1), B to A1 (9), B to O (1); titers 1:1 to 1:16 by Ortho. At 36 months, patient and graft survival are 100%. Antibody-mediated rejection (AbMR) occurred in one patient with thrombophilia and low level donor-specific anti-HLA antibody. Four patients experienced cellular rejection (two subclinical), which responded to oral prednisolone. This series demonstrates that selected patients with low titer ABGAb can undergo ABOi with standard immunosuppression alone, suggesting baseline titer as a reliable predictor of AbMR. This reduces morbidity and cost of ABOi for patients with low titer ABGAb and increases the possibility of ABOi from deceased donors. 
SLC26A4 gene mutations are the second currently identifiable genetic cause of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss after GJB2 mutations. Because of the extensive size of the SLC26A4 gene and the variety of mutations, indirect diagnosis using linkage analysis has been suggested. Therefore, in this investigation three potential short tandem repeat (STR) markers related to this region including D7S2420, D7S496, and D7S2459 were selected for further analysis.
SLC7A11 encodes a subunit of the xCT cystine/glutamate amino-acid transport system and has a critical role in the generation of glutathione and the protection of cells from oxidative stress. Expression of SLC7A11 promotes tumorigenesis and chemotherapy resistance, but while SLC7A11 has been previously noted to be upregulated in hypoxic cells, its regulation has not been fully delineated. We have recently shown that nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) is inhibited by cellular stresses generated by the tumor microenvironment, including hypoxia, and augments tumorigenesis. Here we demonstrate that the inhibition of NMD by various cellular stresses leads to the stabilization and upregulation of SLC7A11 mRNA and protein. The inhibition of NMD and upregulation of SLC7A11 augments intracellular cystine transport and increases intracellular levels of cysteine and glutathione. Accordingly, the inhibition of NMD protects cells against oxidative stress via SLC7A11 upregulation. Together our studies identify a mechanism for the dynamic regulation of SLC7A11, through the stress-inhibited regulation of NMD, and add to the growing evidence that the inhibition of NMD is an adaptive response. 
WWOX was cloned as a tumor suppressor gene mapping to chromosomal fragile site FRA16D. Loss of WWOX is closely related to tumorigenesis, cancer progression, and therapy resistance. Recent studies demonstrate the growing role of WWOX gene in other human pathologies such as metabolic and nervous system-related conditions. The neurologic phenotype of WWOX mutation includes seizures, ataxia, developmental delay, and spasticity of variable severity. WWOX is a ubiquitous protein with high expression in many tissues including brain, cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord. WWOX is highly expressed in different brain regions during murine fetal development and remained unchanged in the cortex and the corpus callosum in adult mice. The mechanism or the putative role of WWOX in the nervous system is still unclear but may include abnormal signaling protein, disruption of neuronal pathways, neuronal differentiation, mitochondrial dysfunction, or apoptosis. Homozygous mutations affecting WWOX in humans are likely to be more described in the future using exome sequencing. The described findings highlight that WWOX plays a critical role in normal central nervous system development and disease. The aim of this review is to summarize the roles of WWOX in the developing brain.
ATP8B1 deficiency is a severe autosomal recessive liver disease resulting from mutations in the ATP8B1 gene characterized by a continuous phenotypical spectrum from intermittent (benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis; BRIC) to progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). Current therapeutic options are insufficient, and elucidating the molecular consequences of mutations could lead to personalized mutation-specific therapies. We investigated the effect on pre-messenger RNA splicing of 14 ATP8B1 mutations at exon-intron boundaries using an in vitro minigene system. Eleven mutations, mostly associated with a PFIC phenotype, resulted in aberrant splicing and a complete absence of correctly spliced product. In contrast, three mutations led to partially correct splicing and were associated with a BRIC phenotype. These findings indicate an inverse correlation between the level of correctly spliced product and disease severity. Expression of modified U1 small nuclear RNAs (snRNA) complementary to the splice donor sites strongly improved or completely rescued splicing for several ATP8B1 mutations located at donor, as well as acceptor, splice sites. In one case, we also evaluated exon-specific U1 snRNAs that, by targeting nonconserved intronic sequences, might reduce possible off-target events. Although very effective in correcting exon skipping, they also induced retention of the short downstream intron.
CXXC5 is a member of the CXXC-type zinc-finger domain containing protein family, which is suggested to function in gene transcription, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton organization. Previous studies have revealed that CXXC5 is expressed in skeletal muscle, but whether it regulates skeletal myogenesis is yet unknown. Here, we screened for the possible signaling pathways in which CXXC5 might participate using luciferase gene reporters. The results indicated that CXXC5 significantly increased the activities of the promoters of genes involved in skeletal muscle differentiation. We therefore studied the role of CXXC5 during skeletal myogenesis in C2C12 myoblasts. Our findings suggest that overexpression of CXXC5 in C2C12 myoblasts facilitated myocyte differentiation, while RNAi interference of CXXC5 significantly inhibited the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. This study suggests that CXXC5 plays a significant role in regulating skeletal myogenesis. 
CYP1B1 plays a critical role in the oxidative metabolism of a variety of exogenous compounds, including carcinogenic compounds, which may be activated during metabolism. There are only a few studies that have examined the association between the two polymorphisms and cancer, and that these studies have been inconclusive. Hence, the aim of the present meta-analysis was to evaluate the relationship between polymorphisms in CYP1B1 G119T and A453G and cancer risk. We performed a detailed search using the PubMed and EMBASE libraries to obtain all relevant published reports on the relationship between the G119T and A453G polymorphisms in CYP1B1 and cancer risk. Combined odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by Stata version 11.2. We conducted stratified analyses based on cancer types, ethnicity, source of controls, and quality assessments. We also made assessments of heterogeneity tests, sensitivity analyses, and publication bias. There were a total of 25 articles with 15,376 cases and 18,382 controls concerning CYP1B1 G119T and 40 articles with 27,983 cases and 35,839 controls concerning A453G polymorphisms. Regarding G119T, the combined results indicate that the variant genotypes were significantly associated with a slightly increased cancer risk in comparison to the homozygote (TT versus GG: p=0.006, OR=1.231, 95% CI: 1.061-1.428), especially for breast cancer and prostate cancer. Moreover, significantly increased associations with cancer risk were demonstrated in Asians in all genetic models. The combined results indicated no association of A453G with cancer risk; however, an association was observed specifically for prostate cancer. This meta-analysis suggests that the CYP1B1 G119T polymorphism may confer to genetic susceptibility to cancer in Asians, especially to breast cancer and prostate cancer. The A453G polymorphism was found to modify the risk of prostate cancer. 
PAH metabolites present in bile are well-known biological markers of exposure in fish, and their investigation is recommended by the ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) and the OSPAR convention (Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) for monitoring purposes. Development of analytical strategies for fish bile is encouraged by the need for more sensitive and informative markers (e.g., capable of tracking the PAH composition of contamination sources) and strengthened by recent results in both fish genomics and proteomics. Herein, the study of the Atlantic cod bile proteome is presented. Preliminary testing for discovering new sensitive markers in the form of expressed proteins affected by PAH exposure (i.e., PAH-protein adducts) is reported. Protein markers were identified using LC-MS/MS analysis, as single biological indicators. Through multivariate analyses, the overall proteome was revealed to be a sensitive multi-biological marker of exposure to PAHs.
IL4I1 encodes an L-phenylalanine oxidase that inhibits T-cell proliferation. It has been recently reported that IL4I1 is expressed in TH17 cells as part of a mechanism that limits their pathogenicity. We have previously identified a population of human FOXP3(+) Treg cells that secrete IL-17 ex vivo; here, we addressed the expression of IL4I1 in that Treg-cell population. We found that in ex vivo isolated circulating Treg cells, IL4I1 expression is induced by activation. Moreover, IL4I1 expression is restricted to cells that do not express Helios, a transcription factor that characterizes natural Treg cells, but that express Aiolos, which is involved in the differentiation of TH17 and induced Treg cells. We also showed that conversion of Treg cells under inflammatory conditions increases IL4I1 expression, likely as part of a regulatory loop that attempts to limit the pathogenicity resulting from their conversion into TH17. The specific expression of IL4I1 in TH17 and iTreg cells may provide insights into approaches that aim at modulating these populations in different pathological conditions involving inflammation-mediated immunosuppression.
CD38 catalyzes the synthesis of two structurally distinct messengers for Ca²⁺-mobilization, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), from cytosolic substrates, NAD and NADP, respectively. CD38 is generally thought of as a type II membrane protein with its catalytic site facing outside. We recently showed that CD38 exists, instead, in two opposite membrane orientations. The determinant for the membrane topology is unknown. Here, specific antibodies against type III CD38 were designed and produced. We show that mutating the positively charged residues in the N-terminal tail of CD38 converted its orientation to type III, with the catalytic domain facing the cytosol and it was fully active in producing intracellular cADPR. Changing the serine residues to aspartate, which is functionally equivalent to phosphorylation, had a similar effect. The mutated CD38 was expressed intracellularly and was un-glycosylated. The membrane topology could also be modulated by changing the highly conserved di-cysteine. The results indicate that the net charge of the N-terminal segment is important in determining the membrane topology of CD38 and that the type III orientation can be a functional form of CD38 for Ca²⁺-signaling. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 13th European Symposium on Calcium.
ATP1A3 mutations have now been recognized in infants and children presenting with a diverse group of neurological phenotypes, including Rapid-onset Dystonia-Parkinsonism (RDP), Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC), and most recently, Cerebellar ataxia, Areflexia, Pes cavus, Optic atrophy, and Sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS) syndrome.
CYP2J2 epoxygenase is a membrane-bound cytochrome P450 primarily expressed in the heart and plays a significant role in cardiovascular diseases. The interactions of CYP2J2 with its redox partner, cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), and with its substrates are quite complex and can have a significant effect on the kinetics of substrate metabolism. Here we show that the N-terminus of CYP2J2 plays an important role in the formation of CYP-CPR complex for subsequent electron transfer. We demonstrate that when CYP2J2-CPR are pre-incubated before the onset of reduction, the kinetics of reduction is triphasic and is of a similar order of magnitude to previously reported rates in other cytochrome P450 systems. However, when CYP2J2 and CPR form a complex during the time course of the experiment the kinetics of the fastest phase for N-terminus containing full-length CYP2J2 is 200 times faster than the kinetics of reduction of N-terminally truncated CYP2J2. Hence, we show that the N-terminus of CYP2J2 is very important to form a productive CYP-CPR complex to facilitate electron transfer.
CYP3A4 is an abundant and catalytically dominant human liver endoplasmic reticulum-anchored cytochrome P450 enzyme engaged in the biotransformation of endo- and xenobiotics, including >50% of clinically relevant drugs. Alterations of CYP3A4 protein turnover can influence clinically relevant drug metabolism and bioavailability and drug-drug interactions. This CYP3A4 turnover involves endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation via the ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent 26 S proteasomal system that relies on two highly complementary E2 Ub-conjugating-E3 Ub-ligase (UBC7-gp78 and UbcH5a-C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP)-Hsc70-Hsp40) complexes, as well as protein kinases (PK) A and C. We have documented that CYP3A4 Ser/Thr phosphorylation (Ser(P)/Thr(P)) by PKA and/or PKC accelerates/enhances its Lys ubiquitination by either of these E2-E3 systems. Intriguingly, CYP3A4 Ser(P)/Thr(P) and ubiquitinated Lys residues reside within the cytosol-accessible surface loop and/or conformationally assembled acidic Asp/Glu clusters, leading us to propose that such post-translational Ser/Thr protein phosphorylation primes CYP3A4 for ubiquitination. Herein, this possibility was examined through various complementary approaches, including site-directed mutagenesis, chemical cross-linking, peptide mapping, and LC-MS/MS analyses. Our findings reveal that such CYP3A4 Asp/Glu/Ser(P)/Thr(P) surface clusters are indeed important for its intermolecular electrostatic interactions with each of these E2-E3 subcomponents. By imparting additional negative charge to these Asp/Glu clusters, such Ser/Thr phosphorylation would generate P450 phosphodegrons for molecular recognition by the E2-E3 complexes, thereby controlling the timing of CYP3A4 ubiquitination and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. Although the importance of phosphodegrons in the CHIP targeting of its substrates is known, to our knowledge this is the first example of phosphodegron involvement in gp78-substrate recruitment, an important step in CYP3A4 proteasomal degradation. 
CAD and cancer account for over one-half of all deaths in the world. It is claimed that the 21st century is the last century for CAD. This is, in part, because CAD is preventable based on randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, which show modifying known risk factors such as cholesterol is associated consistently with 40-60% reduction in morbidity and mortality from CAD. Comprehensive prevention will require modifying genetic risk factors that are claimed to account for 40-60% of predisposition to CAD. The 21st century is meeting this challenge with over 50 genetic risk variants discovered and replicated in large genome-wide association studies involving over 200,000 cases and controls. Similarly, 157 genetic variants have been discovered that regulate plasma lipids including, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. A major finding from these studies is that only 15 of the 50 genetic variants for CAD act through known risk factors. Hence, the pathogenesis of CAD in addition to cholesterol and other known risk factors is due to various other factors, many of which remain unknown. Secondly, genes regulating the plasma triglyceride levels are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of CAD. Thirdly, Mendelian randomization studies show no protection from genes that increase plasma HDL cholesterol. This is contrary to current opinion. These genetic risk variants have provided new targets for the development of novel therapies to prevent CAD. Already a new and potent drug has been developed targeting PCSK9, which is in phase 3 clinical trials and shows great efficacy and safety for prevention of CAD. The 21st century is looking very bright for the prevention of CAD. 
PTEN is a major tumour suppressor protein and a regulator of numerous diverse biological processes. It has an evolutionarily conserved role as a phosphoinositide lipid phosphatase, regulating the PI3K signalling pathway, but also has catalytic phosphatase activity against protein substrates, although the significance of this latter activity is less well understood. Unlike many tumour suppressors, even modest changes in PTEN activity can have strong effects on phenotypes, including tumour formation. Due to this recognised functional significance, several experimental platforms have been developed to assay the catalytic activity of PTEN against different substrates and are being applied to understand this cellular substrate diversity and the regulation of PTEN. Here we present and discuss methods to assay the phosphatase activity of PTEN in vitro. 
PTEN is an important tumor suppressor gene. Interpreting PTEN deficiency in the appropriate microscopic context of cancer may be important to understand its role in tumor development and progression. This may be particularly relevant in heterogeneous tumors. Here, we discuss the usefulness of 3D cultures in understanding the consequences of PTEN inactivation in tissue architecture. Afterwards, we discuss the role of immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization in assessing PTEN loss in tumors. In this review, endometrial carcinoma is used as a model. 
AKR1B10 is a human member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, and is considered to be a tumor biomarker because its expression is known to be significantly induced in the cells of various cancers such as lung non-small-cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of its gene remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), down-regulated the expression of the AKR1B10 gene in the human lung cancer cell line, A549. The treatment of A549 cells with TPA for 24h significantly reduced the mRNA levels, protein levels, and promoter activity of AKR1B10 as well as the growth of A549 cells. TPA induced the phosphorylation of the MAP kinase, ERK, and U0126, an inhibitor of the MAP kinase kinase, MEK1, blocked the down-regulation of AKR1B10 by TPA, indicating that the MAP kinase ERK plays a role in regulating the expression of AKR1B10. TPA also induced c-jun gene expression in an ERK-dependent manner. The co-introduction of the c-Jun protein resulted in a decrease in the mRNA levels and promoter activity of AKR1B10 as well as A549 cell proliferation. These results suggested that the ERK/c-Jun signaling pathway may play an important role in the TPA-triggered down-regulation of AKR1B10 gene expression. 
PTEN (the encoding phosphate and tensin homolog) is a well-known cancer suppressor gene and its mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) occurs in various types of carcinomas. This study aimed to examine the association between LOH of PTEN and prognosis in HER2-expressing and nonexpressing gastric cancer patients.
ABCG2 is responsible for the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, and strongly modulates cancer outcomes. Its high expression at a number of physiological barriers, including blood-brain and intestinal barriers, impacts on drug pharmacokinetics parameters. We characterized MBL-II-141, a specific and potent ABCG2 inhibitor. Combination of 10 mg/kg MBL-II-141 with the anticancer agent CPT-11 completely blocked the growth of 90% freshly implanted ABCG2-positive tumors. Moreover, the same combination slowed the growth of already established tumors. As required for preclinical development, we defined the main pharmacokinetics parameters of MBL-II-141 and its influence on the kinetics of CPT-11 and its active metabolite SN-38 in mice. MBL-II-141 distribution into the brain occurred at a low, but detectable, level. Interestingly, preliminary data suggested that MBL-II-141 is well tolerated (at 50 mg/kg) and absorbed upon force-feeding. MBL-II-141 induced a potent sensitization of ABCG2-positive xenografts to CPT-11 through in vivo ABCG2 inhibition. MBL-II-141 strongly increased CPT-11 levels in the brain, and therefore would be a valuable agent to improve drug distribution into the brain to efficiently treat aggressive gliomas. Safety and other pharmacological data strongly support the reglementary preclinical development of MBL-II-141. 
"IDO2 is a relative of IDO1 implicated in tryptophan catabolism and immune modulation but its specific contributions to normal physiology and pathophysiology are not known. Evolutionary genetic studies suggest that IDO2 has a unique function ancestral to IDO1. In mice, IDO2 gene deletion does not appreciably affect embryonic development or hematopoiesis, but it leads to defects in allergic or autoimmune responses and in the ability of IDO1 to influence the generation of T regulatory cells. Gene expression studies indicate that IDO2 is a basally and more narrowly expressed gene than IDO1 and that IDO2 is uniquely regulated by AhR, which serves as a physiological receptor for the tryptophan catabolite kynurenine. In the established KRN transgenic mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, where IDO1 gene deletion has no effect, IDO2 deletion selectively blunts responses to autoantigen but has no effect on responses to neoantigen challenge. In human populations, natural variations in IDO2 gene sequence that attenuate enzymatic activity have been reported to influence brain cancer control and adaptive immune responses to the IDO2 protein itself, consistent with the concept that IDO2 is involved in shaping immune tolerance in human beings. Biochemical and pharmacological studies provide further evidence of differences in IDO2 enzymology and function relative to IDO1. We suggest that IDO2 may act in a distinct manner from IDO1 as a set-point for tolerance to ""altered-self"" antigens along the self-non-self continuum where immune challenges from cancer and autoimmunity may arise. "
UGGT1 is called as a folding sensor protein that recognizes misfolded glycoproteins and selectively glucosylates high-mannose-type glycans on the proteins. However, conventional approaches using naturally occurring glycoproteins is not optimum in performing precise analysis of the unique properties of UGGT1. We have demonstrated that high-mannose-type glycans, in which various hydrophobic aglycons were introduced, act as good substrates for UGGT1 and are useful analytical tools for its characterization. Moreover, we found that UGGT2, an isoform UGGT1, is also capable of glucosylating these synthetic substrates. Our strategy stemmed on synthetic chemistry has been further strengthened by total synthesis of homogeneous glycoproteins in correctly folded as well as in intentionally misfolded forms. 
CHDH (choline dehydrogenase) is an enzyme catalyzing the dehydrogenation of choline to betaine aldehyde in mitochondria. Apart from this well-known activity, we report here a pivotal role of CHDH in mitophagy. Knockdown of CHDH expression impairs CCCP-induced mitophagy and PARK2/parkin-mediated clearance of mitochondria in mammalian cells, including HeLa cells and SN4741 dopaminergic neuronal cells. Conversely, overexpression of CHDH accelerates PARK2-mediated mitophagy. CHDH is found on both the outer and inner membranes of mitochondria in resting cells. Interestingly, upon induction of mitophagy, CHDH accumulates on the outer membrane in a mitochondrial potential-dependent manner. We found that CHDH is not a substrate of PARK2 but interacts with SQSTM1 independently of PARK2 to recruit SQSTM1 into depolarized mitochondria. The FB1 domain of CHDH is exposed to the cytosol and is required for the interaction with SQSTM1, and overexpression of the FB1 domain only in cytosol reduces CCCP-induced mitochondrial degradation via competitive interaction with SQSTM1. In addition, CHDH, but not the CHDH FB1 deletion mutant, forms a ternary protein complex with SQSTM1 and MAP1LC3 (LC3), leading to loading of LC3 onto the damaged mitochondria via SQSTM1. Further, CHDH is crucial to the mitophagy induced by MPP+ in SN4741 cells. Overall, our results suggest that CHDH is required for PARK2-mediated mitophagy for the recruitment of SQSTM1 and LC3 onto the mitochondria for cargo recognition. 
ABCA1 transporter is one of the key factors defining the level of antiatherogenic HDL in plasma. It is actively involved in the removal of cholesterol from peripheral tissues by reverse cholesterol transport. However, the influence of the level of ABCA1 mRNA and the level of ABCA1 protein 1 in macrophages in atherosclerosis remains unexplored. Using real time PCR we determined ABCA1 mRNA level in macrophages cultured for 5 days with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). ABCA1 mRNA levels in macrophages from patients with arterial stenosis were increased when compared with the control group, P = 0.04. According to a Western blot analysis ABCA1 protein level in macrophages from patients was significantly lower than in the control group, P = 0.01. Our results suggest that the level of ABCA1 mRNA and level of ABCA1 protein in macrophages may be important factors in the development of atherosclerosis.
CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms influence clopidogrel response and clinical outcomes of cardiovascular disease. However, data on their relationship in stroke patients are scarce. We aimed to investigate the influence of CYP2C19 polymorphisms on platelet reactivity and clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke patients treated with clopidogrel. A total of 211 patients were enrolled. All patients were given clopidogrel treatment and underwent CYP2C19 genotyping and platelet function testing by flow cytometry including adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation (ADP-PAg) and platelet activation markers (PAC-1, CD62P and CD63). The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used and ischemic events were evaluated. A total of 129 (61.1%) of the 211 enrolled patients were carriers of CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) alleles (*2, *3). After clopidogrel therapy for 7 days, the levels of ADP-PAg, PAC-1, CD62P and CD63 were higher in carriers than noncarriers. CYP2C19 carriage was associated with more frequent high residual platelet reactivity. CYP2C19 polymorphisms alone could explain 12.9%, 4.3%, 8.9% and 5.5% of the inter-individual variability of ADP-PAg, PAC-1, CD62P and CD63 after clopidogrel treatment, respectively. At 6-month follow-up, 38 (19%) patients were scored poor prognosis and 15 (7.6%) ischemic events were observed. Carriers had poorer prognosis than noncarriers (P=0.025). No significant association of CYP2C19 carriage with ischemic events was found. Multiple regression analysis showed that CYP2C19 carriage was an independent predictor of poor prognosis (odds ratio, 3.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-7.38; P=0.016). In conclusion, carriage of the CYP2C19 LOF allele has significant influence on clopidogrel response and prognosis in patients with ischemic stroke.
ASS1 is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a role in the conversion of citrulline to arginine. In human and mouse tissues, ASS1 protein is found in several components of the immune system, including the thymus and T cells. However, the role of ASS1 in these tissues remains to be defined. Considerable attention has been focused recently on the role of metabolism in T cell differentiation and function. Based on the expression of ASS1 in the immune system, we hypothesized that ASS1 deficiency would result in T cell defects. To evaluate this question, we characterized immune function in hypomorphic fold/fold mice. Analysis of splenic T cells by flow cytometry showed a marked reduction in T cell numbers with normal expression of activation surface markers. Gene therapy correction of liver ASS1 to enhance survival resulted in a partial recovery of splenic T cells for characterization. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the persistence of the ASS1 enzyme defect in T cells and abnormal T cell differentiation and function. Overall, our work suggests that ASS1 plays a role in T cell function, and deficiency produces primary immune dysfunction. In addition, these data suggest that patients with ASS1 deficiency (citrullinemia type I) may have T cell dysfunction. 
CYP27B1 hydroxylates 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in position C1α into biologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, calcitriol. CYP27B1 is expressed in normal tissues and tumors. Since calcitriol indicates anticancer activities and CYP27B1 expression can be deregulated during malignant progression, we analyzed its expression in ovarian cancers in relation to pathomorphological features of tumors and overall survival (OS). Expression of CYP27B1 was evaluated in 61 ovarian tumors, 18 metastases and 10 normal ovaries. Normal ovarian epithelium showed the highest levels CYP27B1 with a significant decrease in its expression in ovarian cancers. Both poorly differentiated primary tumors and metastases showed the lowest level of CYP27B1 expression, while non-metastasizing tumors showed a higher CYP27B1 level than tumors that developed metastases. The expression of CYP27B1 was positively correlated with a lower proliferation rate, lower dynamism of tumor growth and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte response. Furthermore, CYP27B1 expression was negatively correlated with tumor cell modeling of their microenvironment. CYP27B1 expression was also associated with longer OS time. In summary, our results suggest that local expression of CYP27B1 in ovarian tumor cells can modify their behavior and promote a less aggressive phenotype by affecting local concentrations of active of vitamin D levels within the tumor microenvironment.
GNE Myopathy (GNEM) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the GNE gene. It is a slowly progressive distal and proximal muscle weakness sparing the quadriceps. In this study, we applied our model of mutated M743T GNE enzyme skeletal muscle-cultured myoblasts and paired healthy controls to depict the pattern of signaling proteins controlling survival and/or apoptosis of the PI3K/AKT, BCL2, ARTS/XIAP pathways, examined the effects of metabolic changes/stimuli on their expression and activation, and their potential role in GNEM. Immunoblot analysis of the GNEM myoblasts indicated a notable increased level of activated PTEN and PDK1 and a trend of relative differences in the expression and activation of the examined signaling molecules with variability among the cultures. ANOVA analysis showed a highly significant interaction between the level of PTEN and the patients groups. In parallel, the interaction between the level of BCL2, BAX and PTEN with the specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor-LY294002 was highly significant for BCL2 and nearly significant for PTEN and BAX. The pattern of the ARTS/XIAP signaling proteins of GNEM and the paired controls was variable, with no significant differences between the two cell types. The response of the GNEM cells to the metabolic changes/stimuli: serum depletion and insulin challenge, as indicated by expression of selected signaling proteins, was variable and similar to the control cells. Taken together, our observations provide a clearer insight into specific signaling molecules influencing growth and survival of GNEM muscle cells. 
ABO blood group antigens are expressed either on the surface of red blood cells either on a variety of other cells. Based on the available knowledge of the genes involved in their biosynthesis and their tissue distribution, their polymorphism has been suggested to provide intraspecies diversity allowing to cope with diverse and rapidly evolving pathogens. Accordingly, the different prevalence of ABO group genotypes among the populations has been demonstrated to be driven by malaria selection. In the similar manner, a particular ABO blood group may contribute to favour life-extension via biological mechanisms important for surviving or eluding serious disease. In this review, we will suggest the possible association of ABO group with age-related diseases and longevity taking into account the biological role of the ABO glycosyltransferases on some inflammatory mediators as adhesion molecules. 
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) has important roles in tumor suppression, metabolism, and development, yet its regulators, effectors, and functions are not fully understood. DAF-18 is the PTEN ortholog in Caenorhabditis elegans. DAF-18's role is highly conserved to human PTEN, and can be functionally replaced by human PTEN. Thus C. elegans provides a valuable model to study PTEN. This review assesses current and emerging methods to study DAF-18's regulators and functions in C. elegans. We propose genetic modify screens to identify genes that interact with daf-18/PTEN. These genes are potential targets for anticancer drug therapies. We also provide a review on the roles DAF-18/PTEN has during C. elegans development and how studying these physiological roles can provide mechanistic insight on DAF-18/PTEN function. 
PNP deficiency is a rare combined immunodeficiency with autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The immunodeficiency is progressive with normal immune functions at birth, but then, T-cell deficiency with variable B-cell functions usually presents by the age of two yr. The only curative treatment for PNP deficiency is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Here, we present a 13-yr-old girl with late-onset PNP deficiency. Despite many complications of infections, she was successfully transplanted with a reduced intensity-conditioning regimen from an HLA-identical unrelated donor.
SLC25A13 (citrin or aspartate-glutamate carrier 2) is located in the mitochondrial membrane in the liver and its genetic deficiency causes adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). CTLN2 is one of the urea cycle disorders characterized by sudden-onset hyperammonemia due to reduced argininosuccinate synthase activity. This disorder is frequently accompanied with hepatosteatosis in the absence of obesity and ethanol consumption. However, the precise mechanism of steatogenesis remains unclear. The expression of genes associated with fatty acid (FA) and triglyceride (TG) metabolism was examined using liver samples obtained from 16 CTLN2 patients and compared with 7 healthy individuals. Although expression of hepatic genes associated with lipogenesis and TG hydrolysis was not changed, the mRNAs encoding enzymes/proteins involved in FA oxidation (carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase 1α, medium- and very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, and acyl-CoA oxidase 1), very-low-density lipoprotein secretion (microsomal TG transfer protein), and FA transport (CD36 and FA-binding protein 1), were markedly suppressed in CTLN2 patients. Serum concentrations of ketone bodies were also decreased in these patients, suggesting reduced mitochondrial β-oxidation activity. Consistent with these findings, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), a master regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism, was significantly down-regulated. Hepatic PPARα expression was inversely correlated with severity of steatosis and circulating ammonia and citrulline levels. Additionally, phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase was enhanced in CTLN2 livers, which was likely associated with lower hepatic PPARα. Collectively, down-regulation of PPARα is associated with steatogenesis in CTLN2 patients. These findings provide a novel link between urea cycle disorder, lipid metabolism, and PPARα. 
PTEN was discovered as a membrane-associated tumor suppressor protein nearly two decades ago, but the concept that it can be secreted and taken up by recipient cells is revolutionary. Since then, various laboratories have reported that PTEN is indeed secreted and available for uptake by other cells in at least two different guises. First, PTEN may be packaged and exported within extracellular vesicles (EV) called exosomes. Second, PTEN may also be secreted as a naked protein in a longer isoform called PTEN-long. While the conditions favouring the secretion of PTEN-long remain unknown, PTEN secretion in exosomes is enhanced by the Ndfip1/Nedd4 ubiquitination system. In this report, we describe conditions for packaging PTEN in exosomes and their potential use for mediating non cell-autonomous functions in recipient cells. We suggest that this mode of PTEN transfer may potentially provide beneficial PTEN for tumor suppression, however it may also propagate deleterious versions of mutated PTEN causing tumorigenesis. 
CYP2E1 metabolizes a wide array of small, hydrophobic molecules, resulting in their detoxification or activation into carcinogens through Michaelis-Menten as well as cooperative mechanisms. Nevertheless, the molecular determinants for CYP2E1 specificity and metabolic efficiency toward these compounds are still unknown. Herein, we employed computational docking studies coupled to molecular dynamics simulations to provide a critical perspective for understanding a structural basis for cooperativity observed for an array of azoles from our previous binding and catalytic studies (Hartman et al., 2014). The resulting 28 CYP2E1 complexes in this study revealed a common passageway for azoles that included a hydrophobic steric barrier causing a pause in movement toward the active site. The entrance to the active site acted like a second sieve to restrict access to the inner chamber. Collectively, these interactions impacted the final orientation of azoles reaching the active site and hence could explain differences in their biochemical properties observed in our previous studies, such as the consequences of methylation at position 5 of the azole ring. The association of a second azole demonstrated significant differences in interactions stabilizing the bound complex than observed for the first binding event. Intermolecular interactions occurred between the two azoles as well as CYP2E1 residue side chains and backbone and involved both hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds. The relative importance of these interactions depended on the structure of the respective azoles indicating the absence of specific defining criteria for binding unlike the well-characterized dominant role of hydrophobicity in active site binding. Consequently, the structure activity relationships described here and elsewhere are necessary to more accurately identify factors impacting the observation and significance of cooperativity in CYP2E1 binding and catalysis toward drugs, dietary compounds, and pollutants. 
UGT1A1 is a polymorphic enzyme that has been associated with irinotecan drug metabolisms. We developed a pyrosequencing method to detect allele frequency and genotype of UGT1A1 polymorphisms (UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6) in Thai colorectal cancer patients.
PTEN [phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10], a phosphatase and critical tumor suppressor, is regulated by numerous post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and SUMOylation, which affect PTEN localization and protein stability. Here we report ADP-ribosylation as a new post-translational modification of PTEN. We identified PTEN as a novel substrate of tankyrases, which are members of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). We showed that tankyrases interact with and ribosylate PTEN, which promotes the recognition of PTEN by a PAR-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF146, leading to PTEN ubiquitination and degradation. Double knockdown of tankyrase1/2 stabilized PTEN, resulting in the subsequent down-regulation of AKT phosphorylation and thus suppressed cell proliferation and glycolysis in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, tankyrases were up-regulated and negatively correlated with PTEN expression in human colon carcinomas. Together, our study revealed a new regulation of PTEN and highlighted a role for tankyrases in the PTEN-AKT pathway that can be explored further for cancer treatment.
PTEN gene (MIM 601628) is a tumor suppressor gene implicated in PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes (PHTS) including Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, and Proteus-like syndrome. Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome is considered as the pediatric form of PHTS. More recently, children presenting autism spectrum disorders with macrocephaly (ASD-M) have been reported.
SETD1A is a member of trithorax-related histone methyltransferases that methylate lysine 4 at histone H3 (H3K4). We showed previously that Setd1a is required for mesoderm specification and hematopoietic lineage differentiation in vitro. However, it remains unknown whether or not Setd1a controls specific hematopoietic lineage commitment and differentiation during animal development. Here, we reported that homozygous Setd1a knockout (KO) mice are embryonic lethal. Loss of the Setd1a gene in the hematopoietic compartment resulted in a blockage of the progenitor B-cell-to-precursor B-cell development in bone marrow (BM) and B-cell maturation in spleen. The Setd1a-cKO (conditional knockout) mice exhibited an enlarged spleen with disrupted spleen architecture and leukocytopenia. Mechanistically, Setd1a deficiency in BM reduced the levels of H3K4me3 at critical B-cell gene loci, including Pax5 and Rag1/2, which are critical for the IgH (Ig heavy-chain) locus contractions and rearrangement. Subsequently, the differential long-range looped interactions of the enhancer Eμ with proximal 5' DH region and 3' regulatory regions as well as with Pax5-activated intergenic repeat elements and 5' distal VH genes were compromised by the Setd1a-cKO. Together, our findings revealed a critical role of Setd1a and its mediated epigenetic modifications in regulating the IgH rearrangement and B-cell development.
CD38 is a cell-surface protein involved in calcium signaling and contractility of airway smooth muscle. It has a role in normal airway responsiveness and in airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) developed following airway exposure to IL-13 and TNF-α but appears not to be critical to airway inflammation in response to the cytokines. CD38 is also involved in T cell-mediated immune response to protein antigens. In this study, we assessed the contribution of CD38 to AHR and inflammation to two distinct allergens, ovalbumin and the epidemiologically relevant environmental fungus Alternaria. We also generated bone marrow chimeras to assess whether Cd38(+/+) inflammatory cells would restore AHR in the CD38-deficient (Cd38(-/-)) hosts following ovalbumin challenge. Results show that wild-type (WT) mice develop greater AHR to inhaled methacholine than Cd38(-/-) mice following challenge with either allergen, with comparable airway inflammation. Reciprocal bone marrow transfers did not change the native airway phenotypic differences between WT and Cd38(-/-) mice, indicating that the lower airway reactivity of Cd38(-/-) mice stems from Cd38(-/-) lung parenchymal cells. Following bone marrow transfer from either source and ovalbumin challenge, the phenotype of Cd38(-/-) hosts was partially reversed, whereas the airway phenotype of the WT hosts was preserved. Airway inflammation was similar in Cd38(-/-) and WT chimeras. These results indicate that loss of CD38 on hematopoietic cells is not sufficient to prevent AHR and that the magnitude of airway inflammation is not the predominant underlying determinant of AHR in mice. 
ESD is the reference method to achieve en bloc resections for large digestive lesions. Nevertheless, it is a difficult and risky technique. Animal models exist to teach the initial skills, particularly in Japan, where pigs' stomachs are dedicated models to gastric ESD. In Europe, we have to develop different strategies of teaching with dedicated colon models. A pig colon is a good model but thinner and narrower than a human's. In this present work, we evaluated a bovine colon model to perform rectal ESD in retroflexion.
LCAT is activated by apoA-I to form cholesteryl ester. We combined two structures, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) that hydrolyzes the ester bond at the sn-2 position of oxidized (short) acyl chains of phospholipid, and bacteriophage tubulin PhuZ, as C- and N-terminal templates, respectively, to create a novel homology model for human LCAT. The juxtaposition of multiple structural motifs matching experimental data is compelling evidence for the general correctness of many features of the model: i) The N-terminal 10 residues of the model, required for LCAT activity, extend the hydrophobic binding trough for the sn-2 chain 15-20 Å relative to PLA2. ii) The topography of the trough places the ester bond of the sn-2 chain less than 5 Å from the hydroxyl of the catalytic nucleophile, S181. iii) A β-hairpin resembling a lipase lid separates S181 from solvent. iv) S181 interacts with three functionally critical residues: E149, that regulates sn-2 chain specificity, and K128 and R147, whose mutations cause LCAT deficiency. Because the model provides a novel explanation for the complicated thermodynamic problem of the transfer of hydrophobic substrates from HDL to the catalytic triad of LCAT, it is an important step toward understanding the antiatherogenic role of HDL in reverse cholesterol transport. 
MIP is a nonpathogenic, soil-borne predecessor of Mycobacterium avium. It has been reported previously that MIP possesses strong immunomodulatory properties and confers protection against experimental TB and tumor. DCs, by virtue of their unmatched antigen-presentation potential, play a critical role in activation of antitumor and antimycobacterial immune response. The effect of MIP on the behavior of DCs and the underlying mechanisms, however, have not been investigated so far. In the present study, we showed that MIP induces significant secretion of IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-10, and TNF-α by DCs and up-regulates the expression of costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86. MIP(L) induced a significantly higher response compared with MIP(K). PI and Annexin V staining showed that MIP increases DC survival by inhibiting apoptosis. Consistently, higher expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl was observed in MIP-stimulated DCs. Cytokines, produced by naïve T cells, cocultured with MIP-stimulated DCs, showed that MIP promotes Th1/Th17 polarization potential in DCs. Response to MIP was lost in MyD88(-/-)DCs, underscoring the critical role of TLRs in MIP-induced DC activation. Further studies revealed that TLR2 and TLR9 are involved in DC activation by MIP(L), whereas MIP(K) activates the DCs through TLR2. Our findings establish the DC activation by MIP, define the behavior of MIP-stimulated DCs, and highlight the role of TLRs in MIP-induced DC activation. 
PAPSS2 (PAPS synthase 2) provides the universal sulfate donor PAPS (3'-phospho-adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate) to all human sulfotransferases, including SULT2A1, responsible for sulfation of the crucial androgen precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Impaired DHEA sulfation is thought to increase the conversion of DHEA toward active androgens, a proposition supported by the previous report of a girl with inactivating PAPSS2 mutations who presented with low serum DHEA sulfate and androgen excess, clinically manifesting with premature pubarche and early-onset polycystic ovary syndrome.
WWOX is a gene that spans an extremely large chromosomal region. It is derived from within chromosomal band 16q23.2 which is a region with frequent deletions and other alterations in a variety of different cancers. This chromosomal band also contains the FRA16D common fragile site (CFS). CFSs are chromosomal regions found in all individuals which are highly unstable. WWOX has also been demonstrated to function as a tumor suppressor that is involved in the development of many cancers. Two other highly unstable CFSs, FRA3B (3p14.2) and FRA6E (6q26), also span extremely large genes, FHIT and PARK2, respectively, and these two genes are also found to be important tumor suppressors. There are a number of interesting similarities between these three large CFS genes. In spite of the fact that they are derived from some of the most unstable chromosomal regions in the genome, they are found to be highly evolutionarily conserved and the chromosomal region spanning the mouse homologs of both WWOX and FHIT are also CFSs in mice. Many of the other CFSs also span extremely large genes and many of these are very attractive tumor suppressor candidates. WWOX is therefore a member of a very interesting family of very large CFS genes.
PTEN maintains regulatory T cell lineage stability and immune homeostasis.
LIPE is an intracellular neutral lipase, which is capable of hydrolyzing a variety of esters and plays a key role in the mobilization of fatty acids from diacylglycerols. The objectives of this study were to characterize the genetic polymorphism of bovine LIPE gene and to evaluate the possible association between three SNPs in the coding regions of this gene with the fatty acid composition of meat in a cattle population. Forty-three unrelated animals from different cattle breeds were re-sequenced and 21 SNPs were detected over approximately 2600 bp, five of these SNPs were novel. Three SNPs were selected, on the basis of evolutionary conservation, to perform validation and association studies in a crossbred cattle population. Our results may suggest a possible association of SNP1 with contents of oleic acid and total monounsaturated fatty acids (p < 0.01), and SNP2 and SNP3 with Heneicosylic acid content (p < 0.01), may be helpful to improve the quality of meat and improve health. 
CAT ((+)-(13aS)-deoxytylophorinine) is a novel anticancer drug belonging to phenanthroindolizidine alkaloids. A sensitive and reliable liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous quantification of CAT and its pharmacologically active 3-O-desmethyl metabolite (S-4) was developed and validated in rat plasma using rotundine as the internal standard (IS). CAT, S-4 and IS were extracted by acetonitrile protein precipitation and separated on an Eclipse XDB-C18 column (1.8 μm, 4.6 mm × 50 mm) with acetonitrile-water (27:73, v/v) mobile phase containing 0.1% formic acid at a 0.4 mL/min flow rate. Positive ion electrospray ionization in multiple reaction monitoring mode was employed to measure CAT, S-4 and IS by monitoring the transitions m/z 364.2→70.1 for CAT, 350.1→70.1 for S-4 and 356.2→192.2 for IS. Good linear correlation (r(2)>0.991) was achieved for CAT and S-4 over the range of 0.214-128.16 and 0.044-11.00 ng/mL, respectively. The lower limit of quantification was 0.214 ng/mL for CAT and 0.044 ng/mL for S-4, using 50 μL rat plasma samples. The intra- and inter-day precisions were not exceed 15% and the accuracy ranged between 94.80% and 108.22%. The average extraction recoveries of both analytes were greater than 94.62%. The method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of CAT and S-4 in rats after oral administration.
CYP11A1 hydroxylates the side chain of vitamin D3 (D3) in a sequential fashion [D3→20S(OH)D3→20,23(OH)2D3→17,20,23(OH)3D3], in an alternative to the classical pathway of activation [D3→25(OH)D3→1,25(OH)2D3]. The products/intermediates of the pathway can be further modified by the action of CYP27B1. The CYP11A1-derived products are biologically active with functions determined by the lineage of the target cells. This pathway can operate in epidermal keratinocytes. To further define the role of these novel secosteroids we tested them for protective effects against UVB-induced damage in human epidermal keratinocytes, melanocytes and HaCaT keratinocytes, cultured in vitro. The secosteroids attenuated ROS, H2O2 and NO production by UVB-irradiated keratinocytes and melanocytes, with an efficacy similar to 1,25(OH)2D3, while 25(OH)D3 had lower efficacy. These attenuations were also seen to some extent for the 20(OH)D3 precursor, 20S-hydroxy-7-dehydrocholesterol. These effects were accompanied by upregulation of genes encoding enzymes responsible for defense against oxidative stress. Using immunofluorescent staining we observed that the secosteroids reduced the generation cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in response to UVB and enhanced expression of p53 phosphorylated at Ser-15, but not at Ser-46. Additional evidence for protection against DNA damage in cells exposed to UVB and treated with secosteroids was provided by the Comet assay where DNA fragmentation was markedly reduced by 20(OH)D3 and 20,23(OH)2D3. In conclusion, novel secosteroids that can be produced by the action of CYP11A1 in epidermal keratinocytes have protective effects against UVB radiation. This article is part of a special issue entitled '17th Vitamin D Workshop'. 
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), a tumour suppressor negatively regulating the PI3K signalling pathway, is the second most frequently mutated gene in human cancers. Decreased PTEN expression is correlated with colorectal cancer metastases and poor patient survival. Three dimensional (3D) multicellular spheroid models have been postulated to bridge the gap between 2D cell models and animal models for cancer research and drug discovery. However, little is known about the impact of PTEN deletion on the invasion of colon cancer spheroidal cells through a 3D extracellular matrix, and current techniques are limited in their ability to study in vitro 3D cell models in real-time. Here, we investigated the migration and invasion behaviours of the colon cancer cell line HCT116 and its PTEN-/- isogenic cell line using three different in vitro assays, wound healing, transwell invasion, and label-free single cell 3D(2) invasion assays enabled by a resonant waveguide grating (RWG) biosensor. Light microscopic and RWG imaging showed that PTEN deletion influences the spheroid formation of HCT116 cells at high seeding density, and accelerates the spontaneous transfer from the spheroid to substrate surfaces. In vitro migration and invasion assays showed that PTEN knockout increases the 2D migration speed of HCT116 cells, and the invasion rate of individual cells through Matrigel or cells in the spheroid through 3D Matrigel; moreover, the PI3K inhibitor treatment drastically reduces the invasiveness of both cell lines. This study suggests that PTEN knockout potentiates the invasiveness of colorectal cancer spheroidal cells through a 3D extracellular matrix, and the label-free single cell assay is a powerful tool for investigating cancer cell invasion, in particular using 3D cell models. 
CLC transporters catalyze the exchange of Cl(-) for H(+) across cellular membranes. To do so, they must couple Cl(-) and H(+) binding and unbinding to protein conformational change. However, the sole conformational changes distinguished crystallographically are small movements of a glutamate side chain that locally gates the ion-transport pathways. Therefore, our understanding of whether and how global protein dynamics contribute to the exchange mechanism has been severely limited. To overcome the limitations of crystallography, we used solution-state (13)C-methyl NMR with labels on methionine, lysine, and engineered cysteine residues to investigate substrate (H(+)) dependent conformational change outside the restraints of crystallization. We show that methyl labels in several regions report H(+)-dependent spectral changes. We identify one of these regions as Helix R, a helix that extends from the center of the protein, where it forms the part of the inner gate to the Cl(-)-permeation pathway, to the extracellular solution. The H(+)-dependent spectral change does not occur when a label is positioned just beyond Helix R, on the unstructured C-terminus of the protein. Together, the results suggest that H(+) binding is mechanistically coupled to closing of the intracellular access-pathway for Cl(-). 
PTEN is reversibly oxidized in various cells by exogenous hydrogen peroxide as well as by endogenous hydrogen peroxide generated when cells are stimulated with growth factors, cytokines and hormones. A gel mobility shift assay showed that oxidized PTEN migrated more rapidly than reduced PTEN on a non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel. Oxidized PTEN was reduced when treated with dithiothreitol. Supplementation of N-ethylmaleimide in the cell lysis buffer was critical for the apparent bands of oxidized and reduced PTEN. Formation of oxidized PTEN was abolished when the active site Cys(124) or nearby Cys(71) was replaced with Ser suggesting that Cys(124) and Cys(71) are involved in the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond. These results show that the mobility shift assay is a convenient method to analyze the redox state of PTEN in cells. 
ABCG2 c.421C>A is one of the most frequent polymorphisms in ABCG2, which encodes the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Clinical pharmacogenetic studies have shown that the plasma area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values after oral administration of BCRP substrate drugs are significantly higher in subjects homozygous for the c.421C>A polymorphism (421AA) than in wild-type subjects (421CC). The aim of this study was to quantitatively estimate the in vivo decrease of BCRP function caused by the c.421C>A polymorphism based on clinical pharmacokinetic data. Assuming that the pharmacokinetic alteration is accounted for by intestinal BCRP, the ratio of the transport activity of the mutated BCRP to that of the wild-type was optimized by comparing calculations from an intestinal absorption model and clinical pharmacokinetic data. In conclusion, the in vivo intestinal BCRP transport activity in 421AA subjects is estimated to be approximately 23% of that in the 421CC subjects.
ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein/P-gp) is an ATP-binding cassette transporter well known for its association with multidrug resistance in cancer cells. Powered by the hydrolysis of ATP, it effluxes structurally diverse compounds. In this chapter, we discuss current views on the molecular basis of the substrate polyspecificity of P-gp. One of the features that accounts for this property is the structural flexibility observed in P-gp. Several X-ray crystal structures of mouse P-gp have been published recently in the absence of nucleotide, with and without bound inhibitors. All the structures are in an inward-facing conformation exhibiting different degrees of domain separation, thus revealing a highly flexible protein. Biochemical and biophysical studies also demonstrate this flexibility in mouse as well as human P-gp. Site-directed mutagenesis has revealed the existence of multiple transport-active binding sites in P-gp for a single substrate. Thus, drugs can bind at either primary or secondary sites. Biochemical, molecular modeling, and structure-activity relationship studies suggest a large, common drug-binding pocket with overlapping sites for different substrates. We propose that in addition to the structural flexibility, the molecular or chemical flexibility also contributes to the binding of substrates to multiple sites forming the basis of polyspecificity. 
ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) have important roles in preventing acute lung injury. However, it is not clear whether upregulation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis prevents LPS-induced injury in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) by inhibiting the MAPKs/NF-κB pathways. Primary cultured rat PMVECs were transduced with lentiviral-borne Ace2 or shRNA-Ace2, and then treated or not with Mas receptor blocker (A779) before exposure to LPS. LPS stimulation resulted in the higher levels of AngII, Ang-(1-7), cytokine secretion, and apoptosis rates, and the lower ACE2/ACE ratio. Ace2 reversed the ACE2/ACE imbalance and increased Ang-(1-7) levels, thus reducing LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation, while inhibition of Ace2 reversed all these effects. A779 abolished these protective effects of Ace2. LPS treatment was associated with activation of the ERK, p38, JNK, and NF-κB pathways, which were aggravated by A779. Pretreatment with A779 prevented the Ace2-induced blockade of p38, JNK, and NF-κB phosphorylation. However, only JNK inhibitor markedly reduced apoptosis and cytokine secretion in PMVECs with Ace2 deletion and A779 pretreatment. These results suggest that the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis has a crucial role in preventing LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation of PMVECs, by inhibiting the JNK/NF-κB pathways. 
CYP1B1 mutations cause autosomal recessive congenital glaucoma. Disease risk assessment for families with CYP1B1 mutations requires knowledge of the population mutation carrier frequency. The purpose of this study is to determine the CYP1B1 mutation carrier frequency in clinically normal individuals residing in the United States. Because CYP1B1 mutations can exhibit variable expressivity, we hypothesize that the mutation carrier frequency is higher than expected.
CYP19A1 facilitates the bioconversion of estrogens from androgens. CYP19A1 intron single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may alter mRNA splicing, resulting in altered CYP19A1 activity, and potentially influencing disease susceptibility. Genetic studies of CYP19A1 SNPs have been well documented in populations of European ancestry; however, studies in populations of African ancestry are limited. In the present study, ten 'candidate' intronic SNPs in CYP19A1 from 125 African Americans (AA) and 277 European Americans (EA) were genotyped and their frequencies compared. Allele frequencies were also compared with HapMap and ASW 1000 Genomes populations. We observed significant differences in the minor allele frequencies between AA and EA in six of the ten SNPs including rs10459592 (p<0.0001), rs12908960 (p<0.0001), rs1902584 (p = 0.016), rs2470144 (p<0.0001), rs1961177 (p<0.0001), and rs6493497 (p = 0.003). While there were no significant differences in allele frequencies between EA and CEU in the HapMap population, a 1.2- to 19-fold difference in allele frequency for rs10459592 (p = 0.004), rs12908960 (p = 0.0006), rs1902584 (p<0.0001), rs2470144 (p = 0.0006), rs1961177 (p<0.0001), and rs6493497 (p = 0.0092) was observed between AA and the Yoruba (YRI) population. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks and haplotype clusters that is unique to the EA population but not AA was also observed. In summary, we demonstrate that differences in the allele frequencies of CYP19A1 intron SNPs are not consistent between populations of African and European ancestry. Thus, investigations into whether CYP19A1 intron SNPs contribute to variations in cancer incidence, outcomes and pharmacological response seen in populations of different ancestry may prove beneficial. 
CYP3A5 is a cytochrome P450 protein that functions in the liver metabolism of many carcinogens and cancer drugs. However, it has not been thought to directly affect cancer progression. In this study, we challenge this perspective by demonstrating that CYP3A5 is downregulated in many hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), where it has an important role as a tumor suppressor that antagonizes the malignant phenotype. CYP3A5 was downregulated in multiple cohorts of human HCC examined. Lower CYP3A5 levels were associated with more aggressive vascular invasion, poor differentiation, shorter time to disease recurrence after treatment, and worse overall patient survival. Mechanistic investigations showed that CYP3A5 overexpression limited MMP2/9 function and suppressed HCC migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting AKT signaling. Notably, AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 was inhibited in CYP3A5-overexpressing HCC cells, an event requiring mTORC2 but not Rictor/mTOR complex formation. CYP3A5-induced ROS accumulation was found to be a critical upstream regulator of mTORC2 activity, consistent with evidence of reduced GSH redox activity in most clinical HCC specimens with reduced metastatic capacity. Taken together, our results defined CYP3A5 as a suppressor of HCC pathogenesis and metastasis with potential utility a prognostic biomarker.
NSDHL is a 3β-hydroxysterol dehydrogenase that is involved in the removal of two C-4 methyl groups in one of the later steps of cholesterol biosynthesis. Mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme are responsible for the X-linked, male lethal mouse mutations bare patches and striated, as well as most cases of human CHILD syndrome. Rare, hypomorphic NSDHL mutations are also associated with X-linked intellectual disability in males with CK syndrome. Since hemizygous male mice with Nsdhl mutations die by midgestation, we generated a conditional targeted Nsdhl mutation (Nsdhl(tm1.1Hrm)) to investigate the essential role of cholesterol in the early postnatal CNS. Ablation of Nsdhl in radial glia using GFAP-cre resulted in live-born, normal appearing affected male pups. However, the pups develop overt ataxia by postnatal day 8-10 and die shortly thereafter. Histological abnormalities include progressive loss of cortical and hippocampal neurons, as well as deficits in the proliferation and migration of cerebellar granule precursors and subsequent massive apoptosis of the cerebellar cortex. We replicated the granule cell precursor proliferation defect in vitro and demonstrate that it results from defective signaling by SHH. Furthermore, this defect is almost completely rescued by supplementation of the culture media with exogenous cholesterol, while methylsterol accumulation above the enzymatic block appears to be associated with increased cell death. These data support the absolute requirement for cholesterol synthesis in situ once the blood-brain-barrier forms and cholesterol transport to the fetus is abolished. They further emphasize the complex ramifications of cholesterogenic enzyme deficiency on cellular metabolism. 
FABP4 (Fatty acid binding protein 4) is a hot candidate gene in fat deposition and lipid metabolism and participates in the transport and metabolism of intracellular free fatty acids. We aim to study the role of FABP4 in fat deposition and metabolism of the rump fat in Altay sheep. In this study, bioinformatics method was used to analyze the protein sequence homology among 10 species, and RT-PCR was employed to detect FABP4 tissue profiling of Altay sheep. An animal model simulating the rump fat deposition and metabolism of Altay sheep was established by continuous starvation, and qPCR and iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) were used to detecte FABP4 mRNA and protein expression changes in the control and continuous starvation groups, respectively. Sequence analysis showed that FABP4 protein sequence is highly conserved among species, suggesting an important biological function during evolution for FABP4. The RT-PCR result confirmed that FABP4 mRNA was highly expressed in intestinal and rump fat, suggesting that FABP4 plays an important physiological role in fat tissues. We did not find significant differences in FABP4 mRNA and protein between control and continuous starvation groups (P>0.05), which indicates that FABP4 may not be the key gene in fat deposition and metabolism in Altay sheep.The results above lay a foundation for further studies of FABP4 in rump or tail fat. 
PTEN serves as an intrinsic brake on neurite outgrowth, but the regulatory mechanism that governs its action is not clear. In the present study, miR-29a was found to increase neurite outgrowth by decreasing PTEN expression. Results showed that miR-92a-1, miR-29a, miR-92b, and miR-29c expression levels increased during nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. Based on in silico analysis of possible miR-29a targets, PTEN mRNA may be a binding site for miR-29a. A protein expression assay and luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-29a could directly target the 3'-UTRs (untranslated regions) of PTEN mRNA and down-regulate the expression of PTEN. PC12 cells infected with lentiviral pLKO-miR-29a showed far higher levels of miR-29a and Akt phosphorylation level than those infected with control. This promoted neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Collectively, these results indicate that miR-29a is an important regulator of neurite outgrowth via targeting PTEN and that it may be a promising therapeutic target for neural disease. 
AQP4 in the brain is involved in the occurrence and development of a variety of encephalopathy. AQPs family changes in kidney were accompanied by altered UTs family. The aim of this study was to observe AQP4 and UT-A3 expression in CNS and to explore their role in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia encephalopathy following peripheral LPS injection in mice.
WWOX gene is located in FRA16D, the highly affected chromosomal fragile site. Its tumor suppressor activity has been proposed on a basis of numerous genomic alterations reported in chromosome 16q23.3-24.1 locus. WWOX is affected in many cancers, showing as high as 80% loss of heterozygosity in breast tumors. Unlike most tumor suppressors impairing of both alleles of WWOX is very rare. Despite cellular and animal models information on a WWOX role in cancer tissue is limited and sometimes confusing. This review summarizes information on WWOX in human tumors.
PIK3CA encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) which through its role in the PI3K/Akt pathway is important for the regulation of important cellular functions such as proliferation, metabolism and protein synthesis, angiogenesis and apoptosis. Mutations in PIK3CA are known to be involved in a wide range of human cancers and mutant PIK3CA is thought to act as an oncogene. The specific PIK3CA inhibitor, NVP-BYL719, has displayed promising results in cancer therapy and is currently under clinical trials. Furthermore, PI3K regulates autophagy, a cellular process that recycles proteins and organelles through lysosomal degradation and has recently been recognised as an attractive therapeutic target due to its pro- and anti-cancer properties. Several studies have attempted to investigate the effects of combining the inhibition of both PI3K and autophagy in cancer therapy, and an in vivo model has demonstrated that the combined use of a concomitant PI3K and autophagy inhibitor induced apoptosis in glioma cells. 
SDS is a meiosis specific cyclin-like protein and required for DMC1 mediated double-strand break (DSB) repairing in Arabidopsis. Here, we found its rice homolog, OsSDS, is essential for meiotic DSB formation. The Ossds mutant is normal in vegetative growth but both male and female gametes are inviable. The Ossds meiocytes exhibit severe defects in homologous pairing and synapsis. No γH2AX immunosignals in Ossds meiocytes together with the suppression of chromosome fragmentation in Ossds-1 Osrad51c, both provide strong evidences that OsSDS is essential for meiotic DSB formation. Immunostaining investigations revealed that meiotic chromosome axes are normally formed but both SC installation and localization of recombination elements are failed in Ossds. We suspected that this cyclin protein has been differentiated pretty much between monocots and dicots on its function in meiosis. 
PTEN and PIK3CA mutations occur with high frequency in uterine endometrioid carcinoma (UEC). Although PTEN mutations are present in complex atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma, PIK3CA mutations are restricted to carcinoma. We generated mouse models harboring Pten loss and/or activated Pik3ca in the endometrial epithelium to investigate their respective roles in the pathogenesis of UEC. Presence of an activated mutant Pik3ca on the background of Pten loss led to aggressive disease, with 100% of mice exhibiting carcinoma. Expression of Pik3ca with E545K mutation alone was unable to cause hyperplasia or cancer in the uterus and did not activate Akt as effectively as Pten deletion in short-term cultures of mouse endometrial epithelium, likely explaining the lack of phenotype in vivo. We also report that nuclear localization of FOXO1 correlated with PTEN mutational status irrespective of the PIK3CA status in endometrial cancer cell lines. Furthermore, gene expression profiles resulting from Pten loss or activation of Pik3ca in primary mouse endometrial epithelial cells exhibit minimal overlap. Thus, Pten and Pik3ca have distinct consequences on the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway in endometrial epithelium and are likely to affect other nonoverlapping cellular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of the most common type of uterine cancer.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in human cancer, has various cytoplasmic and nuclear functions. PTEN translocates to the nucleus from the cytoplasm in response to oxidative stress. However, the mechanism and function of the translocation are not completely understood. In this study, topotecan (TPT), a topoisomerase I inhibitor, and cisplatin (CDDP) were employed to induce DNA damage. The results indicate that TPT or CDDP activates ATM (ATM serine/threonine kinase), which phosphorylates PTEN at serine 113 and further regulates PTEN nuclear translocation in A549 and HeLa cells. After nuclear translocation, PTEN induces autophagy, in association with the activation of the p-JUN-SESN2/AMPK pathway, in response to TPT. These results identify PTEN phosphorylation by ATM as essential for PTEN nuclear translocation and the subsequent induction of autophagy in response to DNA damage. 
CYP2A13 is a human cytochrome P450 (P450) enzyme important in the bioactivation of the tobacco-specific lung procarcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). CYP2A13 expression levels vary dramatically among lung biopsy samples from patients, presumably owing in part to a suppression of CYP2A13 expression by disease-associated inflammation. Here, we determined whether CYP2A13 expression in the lungs of CYP2A13-humanized mice is suppressed by the presence of lung tumors. Tissues from an NNK lung tumor bioassay were examined. CYP2A13-humanized mice (95-100%) had multiple lung tumors at 16 weeks after NNK (30 or 50 mg/kg) treatment; whereas only ∼9% of saline-treated CYP2A13-humanized mice had lung tumor (∼1/lung). Mice with lung tumors, from the NNK-treated groups, were used for dissecting adjacent tumor-free lung tissues; whereas mice without visible lung tumors, from the saline-treated group, were used as controls. Compared with the controls, the levels of CYP2A13 protein and mRNA were both reduced significantly (by ≥50%) in the NNK-treated groups. The levels of mouse CYP2B10 and CYP2F2 mRNAs were also significantly lower in the dissected normal lung tissues from tumor-bearing mice than in lungs from the control mice. Pulmonary tissue levels of three proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and interleukin-6, were significantly higher in the tumor-bearing mice than in the controls, indicating occurrence of low-grade lung inflammation at the time of necropsy. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that CYP2A13 levels in human lungs can be suppressed by disease-associated inflammation in tissue donors, a scenario causing underestimation of CYP2A13 levels in healthy lungs. 
CYP11B2 inhibition is a promising treatment for diseases caused by excessive aldosterone. To improve the metabolic stability in human liver miscrosomes of previously reported CYP11B2 inhibitors, modifications were performed via a combination of ligand- and structure-based drug design approaches, leading to pyridyl 4,5-dihydro-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinolones. Compound 26 not only exhibited a much longer half-life (t1/2 ≫ 120 min), but also sustained inhibitory potency (IC50 = 4.2 nM) and selectivity over CYP11B1 (SF = 422), CYP17, CYP19, and a panel of hepatic CYP enzymes. 
PC is produced in the liver and inhibits blood coagulation by catalyzing active factors V and VIII. PC deficiency causes abnormal blood clotting that is difficult to regulate by anticoagulative treatments. Four reports of PC deficiency treated with LTx have been published; however, no report of DLT as a therapy for PC deficiency is available. We describe a case of a 23-month-old girl who received DLT for compound heterozygous PC deficiency. Her PC activity was below 5%. She developed intracranial lesion and frequent refractory purpura fulminans. Both her parents had heterozygous mutations of PC genes and were excluded as living donors. Furthermore, she was a low priority on the waiting list of deceased-donor transplantation. We performed living DLT using the liver from a patient with MSUD. Activated PC concentrate safely supported the perioperative period. After DLT, she maintained normal PC activities and BCAA levels. This is the first case of PC deficiency successfully treated by living DLT with MSUD. We propose that DLT using liver from patients with MSUD is a treatment option for PC deficiency. 
WWOX has been recently implicated in autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCAR12) and severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE). By array comparative genomic hybridization, we identified a 0.6 Mb homozygous deletion in 16q23.1 in a fetus presenting with brain anomalies. His older sister who died at the age of 22 months from an EOEE was also homozygous for the copy number variations in 16q23.1. This deletion includes the first six exons of WWOX and results in a null genotype in homozygous patients. This family gives additional support for the implication of WWOX in severe EOEEs. We report for the first time prenatal ultrasound findings in a fetus with a WWOX-null genotype. Our study expands the range of brain abnormalities in WWOX-related EOEEs. This additional family confirms the genotype-phenotype correlation with WWOX-null alleles associated with the most severe form of WWOX-related epileptic encephalopathy with premature death.
"CYP2D6 differences have already been demonstrated within Latin American populations by the CEIBA.FP Consortium of the Ibero-American Network of Pharmacogenetics (RIBEF, as per the acronym in Spanish). However, within the population of Costa Rica, no research has been conducted until now, even though this population has a trihybrid component ancestry that represents an interesting condition. Thus, the present study was aimed to determine the frequency of Ultra-rapid Metabolizers (UMs) and Poor Metabolizers (PMs) in a Costa Rican population, as well as to determine whether there are differences in the CYP2D6-predicted phenotype frequencies among three Costa Rican groups with different ethnic backgrounds. Additionally, these frequencies of PMs and UMs obtained were compared with Ibero-American populations published data. Finally, we also aimed to describe allele frequencies among different Costa Rican ethnic groups. This research has been undertaken within the framework of the RIBEF CEIBA Consortium studies on Latin American populations. A total of 385 individuals were included in the study: 139 mestizos, 197 Amerindians, and 49 Afro-Caribbeans. CYP2D6 genotypes were determined by XL-PCR and Real-Time PCR. The CYP2D6 variant alleles *2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *10, ""17, *29, *35 and *41 were also determined. For the entire Costa Rican population, the frequency of PMs and UMs was 6% and 6.5%, respectively. The percentage of UMs in the mestizo population was higher than in the Amerindian population. CYP2D6 UMs vary from 3.6% to 10.1% and PMs from 1.4% to 10.2% among three Costa Rican groups. The highest frequencies of UMs (10.1%) and PMs (10.2%) were found in the mestizo and Amerindian populations, respectively. In conclusion, the frequencies of UMs and PMs for CYP2D6 varied widely across the mestizo, Amerindian and Afro-Caribbean Costa Rican populations. Future research in this population should be oriented to identify new CYP2D6 variants through sequencing methods, as well as to determine CYP2D6 phenotype, in order to establish the phenotype-genotype relation. Finally, further studies involving genetic markers of ancestry are needed in the Costa Rican population."
CYP11A1 hydroxylates vitamin D3 producing 20S-hydroxyvitamin D3 [20(OH)D3] and 20S,23-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [20,23(OH)2D3] as the major and most characterized metabolites. Both display immuno-regulatory and anti-cancer properties while being non-calcemic. A previous study indicated 20(OH)D3 can be metabolized by rat CYP24A1 to products including 20S,24-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [20,24(OH)2D3] and 20S,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, with both producing greater inhibition of melanoma colony formation than 20(OH)D3. The aim of this study was to characterize the ability of rat and human CYP24A1 to metabolize 20(OH)D3 and 20,23(OH)2D3. Both isoforms metabolized 20(OH)D3 to the same dihydroxyvitamin D species with no secondary metabolites being observed. Hydroxylation at C24 produced both enantiomers of 20,24(OH)2D3. For rat CYP24A1 the preferred initial site of hydroxylation was at C24 whereas the human enzyme preferred C25. 20,23(OH)2D3 was initially metabolized to 20S,23,24-trihydroxyvitamin D3 and 20S,23,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 by rat and human CYP24A1 as determined by NMR, with both isoforms showing a preference for initial hydroxylation at C25. CYP24A1 was able to further oxidize these metabolites in a series of reactions which included the cleavage of C23-C24 bond, as indicated by high resolution mass spectrometry of the products, analogous to the catabolism of 1,25(OH)2D3 via the C24-oxidation pathway. Similar catalytic efficiencies were observed for the metabolism of 20(OH)D3 and 20,23(OH)2D3 by human CYP24A1 and were lower than for the metabolism of 1,25(OH)2D3. We conclude that rat and human CYP24A1 metabolizes 20(OH)D3 producing only dihydroxyvitamin D3 species as products which retain biological activity, whereas 20,23(OH)2D3 undergoes multiple oxidations which include cleavage of the side chain. 
SMYD3 is a histone lysine methyltransferase that plays an important role in transcriptional activation as a member of an RNA polymerase complex, and its oncogenic role has been described in different cancer types. We studied the expression and activity of SMYD3 in a preclinical model of colorectal cancer (CRC) and found that it is strongly upregulated throughout tumorigenesis both at the mRNA and protein level. Our results also showed that RNAi-mediated SMYD3 ablation impairs CRC cell proliferation indicating that SMYD3 is required for proper cancer cell growth. These data, together with the importance of lysine methyltransferases as a target for drug discovery, prompted us to carry out a virtual screening to identify new SMYD3 inhibitors by testing several candidate small molecules. Here we report that one of these compounds (BCI-121) induces a significant reduction in SMYD3 activity both in vitro and in CRC cells, as suggested by the analysis of global H3K4me2/3 and H4K5me levels. Of note, the extent of cell growth inhibition by BCI-121 was similar to that observed upon SMYD3 genetic ablation. Most of the results described above were obtained in CRC; however, when we extended our observations to tumor cell lines of different origin, we found that SMYD3 inhibitors are also effective in other cancer types, such as lung, pancreatic, prostate, and ovarian. These results represent the proof of principle that SMYD3 is a druggable target and suggest that new compounds capable of inhibiting its activity may prove useful as novel therapeutic agents in cancer treatment.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue), as a tumor suppressor gene, plays a significant role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Results from published studies for association between the PTEN IVS4 I/D (rs3830675) polymorphism and cancer risk are inconsistent and inconclusive. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the potential association between PTEN IVS4 I/D polymorphism and risk of cancer in detail. We searched PubMed (Medline) and EMBASE web databases to cover all relevant studies published until December 2013. The meta-analysis was carried out and pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were used to appraise the strength of association. A total of 1,993 confirmed cancer cases and 3,200 controls were included from six eligible case-control studies. Results from overall pooled analysis suggested a significant effect of the PTEN IVS4 I/D polymorphism and cancer risk in all genetic models, i.e., allele (I vs D: OR=0.743, 95%CI=0.648 to 0.852, p=0.001), homozygous (II vs DD: OR=0.673, 95%CI=0.555 to 0.816, p=0.001), heterozygous (ID vs DD: OR=0.641, 95%CI=0.489 to 0.840, p=0.001), dominant (II+ID vs DD: OR=0.626, 95%CI=0.489 to 0.802, p=0.001) and recessive (II vs DD+ID: OR=0.749, 95%CI=0.631 to 0.889, p=0.001). Significant publication bias was detected during the analysis. The present meta-analysis suggests that the PTEN IVS4 I/D polymorphism is significantly associated with reduced risk of cancer. However, future larger studies with other groups of populations are warranted to clarify this association. 
ABAT is a key enzyme responsible for catabolism of principal inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). We report an essential role for ABAT in a seemingly unrelated pathway, mitochondrial nucleoside salvage, and demonstrate that mutations in this enzyme cause an autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder and mtDNA depletion syndrome (MDS). We describe a family with encephalomyopathic MDS caused by a homozygous missense mutation in ABAT that results in elevated GABA in subjects' brains as well as decreased mtDNA levels in subjects' fibroblasts. Nucleoside rescue and co-IP experiments pinpoint that ABAT functions in the mitochondrial nucleoside salvage pathway to facilitate conversion of dNDPs to dNTPs. Pharmacological inhibition of ABAT through the irreversible inhibitor Vigabatrin caused depletion of mtDNA in photoreceptor cells that was prevented through addition of dNTPs in cell culture media. This work reveals ABAT as a connection between GABA metabolism and nucleoside metabolism and defines a neurometabolic disorder that includes MDS. 
ACE inhibitors accounts for 8% of all cases of angioneurotic edema and the overall incidence is 0.1 to 0.7% of patients on ACE inhibitors. It is a leading cause (20-40%) of emergency room visits in the US with angioedema. We report a case of angioedema caused by ACE inhibitors confined to the upper airway after four years on treatment with Lisinopril which persisted for three weeks and required endotracheal intubation and subsequent tracheostomy due to delayed resolution. This case is one of the rare cases presented as upper airway edema which persisted for a long time.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is well known as a tumour suppressor. It's PI(3,4,5)P3 lipid phosphatase activity is an important counteracting mechanism in PI 3-kinase (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) signalling. Furthermore, PTEN lies upstream of Akt kinase, a key enzyme in insulin signalling regulating glucose uptake and cell growth. Therefore, PTEN has recently gained attention as a valuable drug target for the treatment of diabetes, stroke, cardiac infarct and fertility. This review summarizes the use of small molecules as PTEN inhibitors. Currently available methodologies and techniques for accessing PTEN inhibition in vitro and in cellulo will be discussed. 
PTEN has been studied in several tumor models as a tumor suppressor. In this study, we explored the role of PTEN in the inhibition state of polarized M2 subtype of macrophage in tumor microenvironment (TME) and the underlying mechanisms. To elucidate the potential effect in TME, RAW 264.7 macrophages and 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells were co-cultured to reconstruct tumor microenvironment. After PTEN was down-regulated with shRNA, the expression of CCL2 and VEGF-A, which are definited to promote the formation of M2 macrophages, have a dramatically increase on the level of both gene and protein in co-cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages. And at the same time, NHERF-1 (Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulating factor-1), another tumor suppressor has a similar tendency to PTEN. Q-PCR and WB results suggested that PTEN and NHERF-1 were consistent with one another no matter at mRNA or protein level when exposed to the same stimulus. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence techniques confirmed that PTEN and NHERF-1 were coprecipitated, and NHERF-1 protein expression was properly reduced with rCCL2 effect. In addition, cell immunofluorescence images revealed a profound transferance, in co-cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages, an up-regulation of NHERF-1 could promote the PTEN marked expression on the cell membrane, and this form for the interaction was not negligible. These observations illustrate PTEN with a certain synergy of NHERF-1, as well as down-regulation of CCL2 suppressing M2 macrophage transformation pathway. The results suggest that the activation of PTEN and NHERF-1 may impede the evolution of macrophages beyond the M1 into M2 phenotype in tumor microenvironment. 
MTHFR C677T and A1298C have been associated with the risk of preeclampsia (PE), but with conflicting results. We performed this meta-analysis to derive a more precise estimation of the association between MTHFR polymorphisms and PE.
PTEN is a multifunctional phosphatase that regulates immune responses through a PI3K/Akt signaling cascade. HMGB1 plays an important role in the initiation of innate immune responses to induce acute lung injury (ALI). This study was designed to investigate the role of PTEN/Foxo1 signaling in the regulation of in vivo and in vitro innate immune responses in ALI. Using a mouse model of ALI, wild-type (WT) and myeloid-specific PTEN knockout (PTEN(M-KO)) mice were instilled with a recombinant HMGB1 (rHMGB1) or PBS. In some experiments, Foxo1 siRNA or non-specific siRNA was injected into mice 6 h prior to rHMGB1 instillation into lung. We found that rHMGB1 treatment in WT mice increased the expression of PTEN, Foxo1, TLR4, and NF-κB in alveolar macrophages from WT mice. However, macrophage-specific PTEN ablation resulted in reduced Foxo1 and TLR4 while increasing β-catenin (Ser552) and Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation in these cells. Knockdown of Foxo1 with siRNA administration in WT mice ameliorated lung injury and inhibited myeloperoxidase activity followed by rHMGB1 treatment, which was accompanied by decreased mRNA expression coding for TNF-α, IL-1β, MIP2, and IP-10. Moreover, Foxo1 knockdown inhibited the expression of TLR4-dependent IRF3 and IFN-β both in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that PTEN/Foxo1 signaling is critical for triggering HMGB1-mediated innate TLR4 activation during ALI. By identifying the molecular signaling pathways within innate immune system, our studies provide the potential therapeutic targets for ALI.
ABCA1 plays a key role in the initial lipidation of apoA-I, which generates circulating HDL cholesterol. Whereas it is known that the transcriptional upregulation of ABCA1 promotes HDL formation and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), it is not known how the inhibition of ABCA1 protein degradation impacts HDL function. Employing the small molecule triacetyl-3-hydroxyphenyladenosine (IMM-H007), we determined how the attenuation of ABCA1 protein degradation affects HDL cholesterol efflux capacity, RCT, and atherosclerotic lesion formation. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that IMM-H007 inhibits ABCA1 degradation and facilitates its cell-surface localization in macrophages, and additional studies in macrophages showed that IMM-H007 thereby promotes cholesterol efflux. IMM-H007 treatment of Paigen diet-fed mice caused an increase in circulating HDL level, it increased the cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL, and it enhanced in vivo RCT from macrophages to the plasma, liver, and feces. Furthermore, ABCA1 degradation suppression by IMM-H007 reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation in apoE(-/-) mice. Thus, via effects on both ABCA1-expressing cells and circulating HDL function, the inhibition of ABCA1 protein degradation by IMM-H007 promotes HDL cholesterol efflux capacity and RCT and attenuates atherogenesis. IMM-H007 potentially represents a lead compound for the development of agents to augment HDL function. 
PTEN is the most important negative regulator of the PI3K signaling pathway. In addition to its canonical, PI3K inhibition-dependent functions, PTEN can also function as a tumor suppressor in a PI3K-independent manner. Indeed, the PTEN network regulates a broad spectrum of biological functions, modulating the flow of information from membrane-bound growth factor receptors to nuclear transcription factors, occurring in concert with other tumor suppressors and oncogenic signaling pathways. PTEN acts through its lipid and protein phosphatase activity and other non-enzymatic mechanisms. Studies conducted over the past 10 years have expanded our understanding of the biological role of PTEN, showing that in addition to its ability to regulate proliferation and cell survival, it also plays an intriguing role in regulating genomic stability, cell migration, stem cell self-renewal, and tumor microenvironment. Changes in PTEN protein levels, location, and enzymatic activity through various molecular mechanisms can generate a continuum of functional PTEN levels in inherited syndromes, sporadic cancers, and other diseases. PTEN activity can indeed, be modulated by mutations, epigenetic silencing, transcriptional repression, aberrant protein localization, and post-translational modifications. This review will discuss our current understanding of the biological role of PTEN, how PTEN expression and activity are regulated, and the consequences of PTEN dysregulation in human malignant tumors. 
CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism might play a key role in pathogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Many case-control studies have investigated the association between CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism and OSCC susceptibility. However, the conclusions are inconsistent. To aim a convincible conclusion, we carried out a meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the association of CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism with OSCC susceptibility. We searched Pubmed, Web of Science, Ovid and Embase databases for available publications. The odds ratio (OR) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was carried out to estimate the association. A total of 13 papers including 1468 cases and 2183 controls were included, a significant increased OSCC risk was observed in recessive model (OR=1.64, 95% CI=1.08-2.49), but not other genetic models. Our results suggest that the homozygous variant of CYP1A1 Ile462Val might be a risk factor of OSCC. 
IL4I1 (interleukin-4-induced gene 1) is a phenylalanine oxidase produced mainly by APCs of myeloid origin, and converts phenylalanine (Phe) to phenylpyruvate, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia. We have previously shown that IL4I1 is highly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages from various human cancers and facilitates immune evasion from the cytotoxic response in a murine tumor model. Indeed, IL4I1 inhibits T-cell proliferation via hydrogen peroxide toxicity on effector/memory T cells. Here, we explored the effect of IL4I1 on naïve CD4(+) T-cell differentiation. We show that IL4I1 stimulates the generation of Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells in vitro from human and mouse T cells. This effect was observed with IL4I1 from different sources, including the naturally produced enzyme. Conversely, IL4I1 limits Th1 and Th2 polarization while modifying the Th17 phenotype, in particular, by inducing its own production. Analysis of Treg-cell induction under conditions of Phe deprivation and hydrogen peroxide addition suggests that Phe consumption by the enzyme participates in Treg-cell enrichment. In line with this hypothesis, IL4I1 inhibits mTORC1 signaling shortly after T-cell activation. Thus, the IL4I1 enzyme may act on T cells both by direct inhibition of effector cell proliferation and by indirect immunoregulation mediated by Treg-cell induction. 
PRPS1 encodes isoform I of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (PRS-I), a key enzyme in nucleotide biosynthesis. Different missense mutations in PRPS1 cause a variety of disorders that include PRS-I superactivity, nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing impairment, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Arts syndrome. It has been proposed that each mutation would result in a specific phenotype, depending on its effects on the structure and function of the enzyme.
CA1 hippocampal N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptors (NMDARs) are necessary for contextually related learning and memory processes. Extinction, a form of learning, has been shown to require intact hippocampal NMDAR signalling. Renewal of fear expression can occur after fear extinction training, when the extinguished fear stimulus is presented in an environmental context different from the training context and thus, renewal is dependent on contextual memory. In this study, we show that a Grin1 knock-out (loss of the essential NR1 subunit for the NMDAR) restricted to the bilateral CA1 subfield of the dorsal hippocampus does not affect acquisition of learned fear, but does attenuate extinction of a cued fear response even when presented in the extinction-training context. We propose that failure to remember the (safe) extinction context is responsible for the abnormal fear response and suggest it is a dysfunctional renewal. The results highlight the difference in outcome of extinguished fear memory resulting from a partial rather than complete loss of function of the hippocampus and suggest a potential mechanism for abnormally increased fear expression in PTSD.
CYP2D6 contributes to the metabolism of many clinically used drugs and is increasingly tested to individualize drug therapy. The CYP2D6 gene is challenging to genotype due to the highly complex nature of its gene locus. TaqMan technology is widely used in the clinical and research settings for genotype analysis due to assay reliability, low cost, and the availability of commercially available assays. The assay identifying 1023C>T (rs28371706) defining a reduced function (CYP2D6*17) and several nonfunctional alleles, produced a small number of unexpected diplotype calls in three independent sets of samples, i.e. calls suggested the presence of a CYP2D6*4 subvariant containing 1023C>T. Gene resequencing did not reveal any unknown SNPs in the primer or probe binding sites in any of the samples, but all affected samples featured a trio of SNPs on their CYP2D6*4 allele between one of the PCR primer and probe binding sites. While the phenomenon was ultimately overcome by an alternate assay utilizing a PCR primer excluding the SNP trio, the mechanism causing this phenomenon remains elusive. This rare and unexpected event underscores the importance of assay validation in samples representing a variety of genotypes, but also vigilance of assay performance in highly polymorphic genes such as CYP2D6.
IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur frequently in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers. The mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes convert α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which dysregulates a set of α-KG-dependent dioxygenases. To determine whether mutant IDH enzymes are valid targets for cancer therapy, we created a mouse model of AML in which mice were transplanted with nucleophosmin1 (NPM)(+/-) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells cotransduced with four mutant genes (NPMc, IDH2/R140Q, DNMT3A/R882H, and FLT3/ITD), which often occur simultaneously in human AML patients. Conditional deletion of IDH2/R140Q blocked 2-HG production and maintenance of leukemia stem cells, resulting in survival of the AML mice. IDH2/R140Q was necessary for the engraftment or survival of NPMc(+) cells in vivo. Gene expression analysis indicated that NPMc increased expression of Hoxa9. IDH2/R140Q also increased the level of Meis1 and activated the hypoxia pathway in AML cells. IDH2/R140Q decreased the 5hmC modification and expression of some differentiation-inducing genes (Ebf1 and Spib). Taken together, our results indicated that IDH2 mutation is critical for the development and maintenance of AML stem-like cells, and they provided a preclinical justification for targeting mutant IDH enzymes as a strategy for anticancer therapy.
ESD is an established effective treatment modality for premalignant and early-stage malignant lesions of the stomach, esophagus, and colorectum. Compared with EMR, ESD is generally associated with higher rates of en bloc, R0, and curative resections and a lower rate of local recurrence. Oncologic outcomes with ESD compare favorably with competing surgical interventions, and ESD also serves as an excellent T-staging tool to identify noncurative resections that will require further treatment. ESD is technically demanding and has a higher rate of adverse events than most endoscopic procedures including EMR. As such,sufficient training is critical to ensure safe conduct and high-quality resections. A standardized training model for Western endoscopists has not been clearly established,but will be self-directed and include courses, animal model training, and optimally an observership at an expert center.Numerous dedicated ESD devices are now available in the United States from different manufacturers. Although the use of ESD in the United States is increasing, issues related to technical difficulty, limited training opportunities and mentors, risk of adverse events, long procedure duration,and suboptimal reimbursement may limit ESD adoption in the United States to a modest number of academic referral centers for the foreseeable future.
CYP1B1 is a P450 enzyme which is involved in the activation of pro-carcinogens to carcinogens as well as estrogen metabolism. We hypothesized that genetic variants in CYP1B1 may modify individual susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
CD36 is a multifunctional glycoprotein expressed on various human cells, including platelets and monocytes. Five CD36 gene mutations (C268T, 949insA, 329-339del, 1228-1239del and 629-631del/insAAAAC) are mainly responsible for CD36-deficient phenotypes in Japan. It has also been reported that platelet CD36 expression varies widely among normal phenotype individuals. Here, in order to obtain further insight into CD36 expression, we investigated the association between platelet and monocyte CD36 expression levels and defective mutations in the Japanese population.
CYP1B1 is recognized as a new target in cancer prevention and therapy. Taking α-naphthoflavone as a lead, a series of 6,7,10-trimethoxy-α-naphthoflavones (4a-o) were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory potency against CYP1B1 and selectivity over CYP1A1 and 1A2. SAR analysis indicated that introducing methoxy groups at C(6), C(7), and C(10) on the naphthalene part and a fluoro atom at C(3') on the B-ring, could sharply increase the efficiency toward CYP1B1 inhibition. Among the prepared derivatives, compound 4c is the most potent and selective CYP1B1 inhibitor ever reported. More effort was taken to acquire water-soluble α-naphthoflavone derivatives for further cell-based study of overcoming anticancer drug-resistance. Finally, we obtained water-soluble naphthoflavone (11f) which could obviously eliminate the docetaxel-resistance caused by the enhanced expression of CYP1B1 in MCF-7/1B1 cells. It could be envisaged that the discovery of new α-naphthoflavones as CYP1B1 inhibitors is clinically important for overcoming CYP1B1-mediated drug-resistance in cancer therapeutics. 
TPI1 promoter polymorphisms occur in high prevalence in individuals from African origin. Malaria-patients from Angola and Mozambique were screened for the TPI1 gene promoter variants rs1800200A>G, (-5G>A), rs1800201G>A, (-8G>A), rs1800202T>G, (-24T>G), and for the intron 5 polymorphism rs2071069G>A, (2262G>A). -5G>A and -8G>A variants occur in 47% and 53% in Angola and Mozambique, respectively while -24T>G was monomorphic for the wild-type T allele. Six haplotypes were identified and -8A occurred in 45% of the individuals, especially associated with the GAG haplotype and more frequent in non-severe malaria groups, although not significantly. The arising and dispersion of -5G>A and -8G>A polymorphisms is controversial. Their age was estimated by analyses of two microsatellite loci, CD4 and ATN1, adjacent to TPI1 gene. The -5G>A is older than -8G>A, with an average estimate of approximately 35,000 years. The -8A variant arose in two different backgrounds, suggesting independent mutational events. The first, on the -5G background, may have occurred in East Africa around 20,800 years ago; the second, on the -5A background, may have occurred in West Africa some 7500 years ago. These estimates are within the period of spread of agriculture and the malaria mosquito vector in Africa, which could has been a possible reason for the selection of -8A polymorphism in malaria endemic countries.
STRA6 is a plasma membrane protein that mediates the transport of vitamin A, or retinol, from plasma retinol binding protein (RBP) into the cell. Mutations in human STRA6 are associated with Matthew-Wood syndrome, which is characterized by severe developmental defects. Despite the obvious importance of this protein to human health, little is known about its structure and mechanism of action. To overcome the difficulties frequently encountered with the production of membrane proteins for structural determination, STRA6 has been expressed in Pichia pastoris as a fusion to green fluorescent protein (GFP), a strategy which has been a critical first step in solving the crystal structures of several membrane proteins. STRA6-GFP was correctly targeted to the cell surface where it bound RBP. Here we report the large-scale expression, purification and characterisation of STRA6-GFP. One litre of culture, corresponding to 175 g cells, yielded about 1.5 mg of pure protein. The interaction between purified STRA6 and its ligand RBP was studied by surface plasmon resonance-based binding analysis. The interaction between STRA6 and RBP was not retinol-dependent and the binding data were consistent with a transient interaction of 1 mole RBP/mole STRA6.
PTEN acts as a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase with a possible role in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. Mutations in PTEN are frequent and their presence is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, which is the most common type of non-cutaneous malignancy in females. Delivery of the tumor suppressor PTEN gene represents a powerful strategy for breast cancer therapy, but a present limitation of gene therapy is the ability to deliver sufficient quantities of active proteins to target cells. The capacity of HSV-1VP22 fusion proteins to spread from the primary transduced cell to surrounding cells could improve gene therapeutics, particularly in cancer. To assess the potential efficacy of VP22 as a gene therapy for breast cancer, expression vectors for N- and C-terminal PTEN-VP22 fusion proteins were constructed. VP22‑mediated intercellular transport and antitumor efficacy in BT549 (PTEN-null) breast tumor cells were investigated. The results showed that PTEN-VP22 has the same spreading abilities as VP22. In cell proliferation and apoptosis assays, PTEN-VP22 gene transfer induces a stronger anti-proliferative effect and apoptotic activity compared with PTEN gene transfer alone. In addition, VP22 enhanced the PTEN‑mediated decrease in the level of phosphorylated AKT. The results show that PTEN-VP22 can spread in vitro and PTEN-VP22 gene induces significantly greater antitumor activity than the PTEN gene alone. This study confirms the utility of VP22-mediated delivery in vitro and suggests that PTEN-VP22 may have applications in breast cancer gene therapy.
PTEN is known to be frequently mutated in uterine cancer and also dephosphorylates FAK. Here, we examined the impact of PTEN alterations on the response to treatment with a FAK inhibitor (GSK2256098). In vitro and in vivo therapeutic experiments were carried out using PTEN-mutated and PTEN-wild-type models of uterine cancer alone and in combination with chemotherapy. Treatment with GSK2256098 resulted in greater inhibition of pFAK(Y397) in PTEN-mutated (Ishikawa) than in PTEN-wild-type (Hec1A) cells. Ishikawa cells were more sensitive to GSK2256098 than the treated Hec1A cells. Ishikawa cells were transfected with a wild-type PTEN construct and pFAK(Y397) expression was unchanged after treatment with GSK2256098. Decreased cell viability and enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy (paclitaxel and topotecan) in combination with GSK2256098 was observed in Ishikawa cells as compared with Hec1a cells. In the Ishikawa orthoptopic murine model, treatment with GSK2256098 resulted in lower tumor weights and fewer metastases than mice inoculated with Hec1A cells. Tumors treated with GSK2256098 had lower microvessel density (CD31), less cellular proliferation (Ki67), and higher apoptosis (TUNEL) rates in the Ishikawa model when compared with the Hec1a model. From a large cohort of evaluable patients, increased FAK and pFAK(Y397) expression levels were significantly related to poor overall survival. Moreover, PTEN levels were inversely related to pFAK(Y397) expression. These preclinical data demonstrate that PTEN-mutated uterine cancer responds better to FAK inhibition than does PTEN wild-type cancer. Therefore, PTEN could be a biomarker for predicting response to FAK-targeted therapy during clinical development.
CYP2C19 is a polymorphic enzyme that metabolizes a wide variety of therapeutic drugs that has been associated with altered enzymatic activity and adverse drug reactions. Differences in allele frequencies of the CYP2C19 gene have been detected in populations worldwide. Thus, we analysed the alleles CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP2C19*4 and CYP2C19*5 related to the poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype in a Mexican population sample (n = 238), as well as CYP2C19*17, unique allele related to ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype (UMs). Genotypes were determined using SNaPshot and TaqManqPCR assays. In addition to the wild-type CYP2C19*1 allele (77.1%), we only found CYP2C19*17 (14.3%) and CYP2C19*2 (8.6%). Comparison with previous population reports demonstrated that these two SNPs are homogeneously distributed in Latin America (P > 0.05). Based on comparison with a previous pharmacokinetic study that determined the frequency of CYP2C19 phenotypes in the same population (western Mexican), we obtained the following findings: (i) based on the difference between the frequency of genotypes CYP2C19*2/*2 (presumably PM) versus the observed prevalence of PM phenotypes (0.4 versus 6.3%; Χ(2) = 9.58, P = 0.00196), we inferred the plausible presence of novel CYP2C19 alleles related to the PM phenotype; (ii) the prevalence of UMs was in disagreement with the dominant inheritance pattern suggested for CYP2C19*17 (23.1 versus 4%; P < 0.00001); (iii) the apparent recessive inheritance pattern of CYP2C19*17, based on the agreement between homozygous CYP2C19*17/*17 (presumably UMs) and the observed prevalence of UMs (2.1 versus 4%; (Χ(2) = 1.048; P = 0.306). 
ABCC2 gene polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with drug-resistant epilepsy. However, the published results were controversial. To comprehensively re-evaluate the association between ABCC2 gene polymorphisms and drug-resistant epilepsy in Asian, we carried out this meta-analysis, which included eight related studies. Studies were selected using PUBMED, Web of science, the Cochrane database of system reviews and Embase. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the association. Studies with 1302 drug-resistant cases and 1563 drug-sensitive controls were included. No significant association was detected by combined analyses for C-24T, G-1774delG, C3972T and G2934A. However, significant association was found in recessive model for G1249A polymorphism (GG vs. GA+AA: OR=0.72, 95%CI=0.53-0.96, P=0.03), indicating the recessive model of G1249A in MRP2/ABCC2 might decrease the risk of drug resistance in Asian epilepsy. 
CFTR is expressed in cardiac myocytes. In mice, lack of CFTR alters cardiomyocyte contraction and Ca2+ signaling, and decreases cardiac reserve. We undertook a pilot study evaluating left ventricular (LV) function in CF patients using strain and strain rate echocardiography.
PTEN is proposed to function at the plasma membrane, where receptor tyrosine kinases are activated. However, the majority of PTEN is located throughout the cytoplasm. Here, we show that cytoplasmic PTEN is distributed along microtubules, tethered to vesicles via phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), the signature lipid of endosomes. We demonstrate that the non-catalytic C2 domain of PTEN specifically binds PI(3)P through the CBR3 loop. Mutations render this loop incapable of PI(3)P binding and abrogate PTEN-mediated inhibition of PI 3-kinase/AKT signaling. This loss of function is rescued by fusion of the loop mutant PTEN to FYVE, the canonical PI(3)P binding domain, demonstrating the functional importance of targeting PTEN to endosomal membranes. Beyond revealing an upstream activation mechanism of PTEN, our data introduce the concept of PI 3-kinase signal activation on the vast plasma membrane that is contrasted by PTEN-mediated signal termination on the small, discrete surfaces of internalized vesicles. 
CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed in multiple myeloma and is a promising target for immunotherapy. Daratumumab is a human monoclonal antibody that has potent anti-multiple myeloma activity both as monotherapy and in combination with other multiple myeloma treatments, and has breakthrough designation on this basis.
CYP17A1 gene encodes P450c17 proteins, which is a key enzyme that catalyzes the formation of sex hormones. Many clinical studies showed that sex hormones levels play an important role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the relationship between CYP17A1 genetic polymorphisms and CAD remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of CYP17A1 genetic polymorphisms with CAD in a Han population of China.
CYP1A2 is important for metabolizing various clinically used drugs. Phenotyping of CYP1A2 may prove helpful for drug individualization therapy. Several HPLC methods have been developed for quantification of caffeine metabolites in plasma and urine. Aim of the present study was to develop a valid and simple HPLC method for evaluating CYP1A2 activity during exposure in xenobiotics by the use of human saliva. Caffeine and paraxanthine were isolated from saliva by liquid-liquid extraction (chlorophorm/isopropanol 85/15v/v). Extracts were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column with mobile phase 0.1% acetic acid/methanol/acetonitrile (80/20/2 v/v) and detected at 273nm. Caffeine and paraxanthine elution times were <13min with no interferences from impurities or caffeine metabolites. Detector response was linear (0.10-8.00µg/ml, R(2) >0.99), recovery was >93% and bias <4.47%. Intra- and inter-day precision was <5.14% (n=6). The limit of quantitation was 0.10µg/ml and the limit of detection was 0.018±0.002µg/mL for paraxanthine and 0.032±0.002µg/ml for caffeine. Paraxanthine/caffeine ratio of 34 healthy volunteers was significantly higher in smokers (p<0.001). Saliva paraxanthine/caffeine ratios and urine metabolite ratios were highly correlated (r=0.85, p<0.001). The method can be used for the monitoring of CYP1A2 activity in clinical practice and in studies relevant to exposure to environmental and pharmacological xenobiotics.
CES1 is involved in the hydrolysis of ester group-containing xenobiotic and endobiotic compounds including several essential and commonly used drugs. The individual variation in the efficacy and tolerability of many drugs metabolized by CES1 is considerable. Hence, there is a large interest in individualizing the treatment with these drugs. The present review addresses the issue of individualized treatment with drugs metabolized by CES1. It describes the composition of the gene encoding CES1, reports variants of this gene with focus upon those with a potential effect on drug metabolism and provides an overview of the protein structure of this enzyme bringing notice to mechanisms involved in the regulation of enzyme activity. Subsequently, the review highlights drugs metabolized by CES1 and argues that individual differences in the pharmacokinetics of these drugs play an important role in determining drug response and tolerability suggesting prospects for individualized drug therapies. Our review also discusses endogenous substrates of CES1 and assesses the potential of using metabolomic profiling of blood to identify proxies for the hepatic activity of CES1 that predict the rate of drug metabolism. Finally, the combination of genetics and metabolomics to obtain an accurate prediction of the individual response to CES1-dependent drugs is discussed. 
PIK3CA mutations involving exons 9 and 20 are among the most common aberrations seen in human malignancies. The identification of PIK3CA mutations in small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is sparse. There is some evidence that tumors with this mutation may be a good target for inhibitors of the PI3K pathway.
ABO genotyping has been routinely used to identify suspects or unknown remains in crime investigations. Probe-based fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA) is a powerful tool for mutation detection and is based on melting temperature shifts due to thermal denaturation. In the present study, we developed a new method for ABO genotyping using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe-based FMCA. This method allowed for the simultaneous detection of three single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites in the ABO gene (nucleotide positions 261, 526, and 803) and the determination of 14 ABO genotypes (A/A, A/O01 or A/O02, A/O03, B/B, B/O01 or B/O02, B/O03, O01/O01 or O01/O02 or O02/O02, O01/O03 or O02/O03, O03/O03, A/B, cis-AB01/A, cis-AB01/B, cis-AB01/O01 or cis-AB01/O02, and cis-AB01/cis-AB01). Using this method, we analyzed 80 samples and successfully identified ABO genotypes (A/A [n=5], A/O01 or A/O02 [n=23], B/B [n=3], B/O01 or B/O02 [n=18], A/B [n=9], O01/O01 or O01/O02 or O02/O02 [n=20], cis-AB01/A [n=1], and cis-AB01/O01 or cis-AB01/O02 [n=1]). In addition, all steps in the method, including polymerase chain reaction, PNA probe hybridization, and FMCA, could be performed in one single closed tube in less than 3h. Since no processing or separation steps were required during analysis, this method was more convenient and rapid than traditional methods and reduced the risk of contamination. Thus, this method may be an effective and helpful tool in forensic investigations. 
SLCO1B1 variants are associated with intermediate outcomes that may increase risk of death/myocardial infarction (MI) in statin-treated patients.
PTEN may play a reversible role in TNFα induced insulin resistance, which has been linked to obesity-associated insulin resistance (IR).
ABCC2 is a transporter with key influence on liver and kidney pharmacokinetics. In order to explore the structure-activity relationships of compounds that modulate ABCC2, and by doing so gain insights into drug-drug interactions, we screened a library of 432 compounds for modulators of radiolabeled β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) (EG) and fluorescent 5(6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorofluorescein transport (CDCF) in membrane vesicles. Following the primary screen at 80μM, dose-response curves were used to investigate in detail 86 compounds, identifying 16 low μM inhibitors and providing data about the structure-activity relationships in four series containing 19, 24, 10, and eight analogues. Measurements with the CDCF probe were consistently more robust than for the EG probe. Only one compound was clearly probe-selective with a 50-fold difference in the IC50s obtained by the two assays. We built 24 classification models using the SVM and fused-XY Kohonen methods, revealing molecular descriptors related to number of rings, solubility and lipophilicity as important to distinguish inhibitors from inactive compounds. This study is to the best of our knowledge the first to provide details about structure-activity relationships in ABCC2 modulation.
ABO blood groups are associated with various diseases. A relationship between Achilles tendon ruptures and blood type O has been reported, although its pathogenesis was not clear. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published study describing the relationship between blood type and rotator cuff tendon tears.
ENO1 plays a paradoxical role in driving the pathogenesis of tumors. However, the clinical significance of ENO1 expression remains unclear and its function and modulatory mechanisms have never been reported in endometrial carcinoma (EC). In this study, ENO1 silencing significantly reduced cell glycolysis, proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, as well as tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo by modulating p85 suppression. This in turn mediated inactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling and its downstream signals including glycolysis, cell cycle progression, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated genes. These effects on glycolysis and cell growth were not observed after ENO1 suppression in normal human endometrial epithelial cells (HEEC). Knocking down ENO1 could significantly enhance the sensitivity of EC cells to cisplatin (DDP) and markedly inhibited the growth of EC xenografts in vivo. In clinical samples, EC tissues exhibited higher expression levels of ENO1 mRNA and protein compared with normal endometrium tissues. Patients with higher ENO1 expression had a markedly shorter overall survival than patients with low ENO1 expression. We conclude that ENO1 favors carcinogenesis, representing a potential target for gene-based therapy. 
CYP2C9 is one of four known members of the human cytochrome P450 CYP2C superfamily, with at least 57 CYP2C9 alleles being previously identified. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C9 significantly influence the efficacy and safety of some drugs, which might cause adverse effects and therapeutic failure. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the role of 36 CYP2C9 alleles, 21 novel alleles (*36-*56) found in the Chinese population, in the oxidative metabolism of diclofenac in vitro. Insect microsomes expressing the 36 human CYP2C9 alleles were incubated with 2-100 μM diclofenac for 30 min at 37 degrees C and terminated by the addition of 30 μL 0.1 M HCl. Diclofenac and 4'-hydroxyl (OH)-diclofenac, the major diclofenac metabolite, were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Compared with wild-type CYP2C9*1, most variants showed significantly altered values in V(max), K(m) and intrinsic clearance (V(max)/K(m)). Only one variant exhibited markedly increased intrinsic clearance value, whereas 31 variants exhibited significantly decreased values. Thus, this study demonstrated that more attention should be given to subjects carrying these CYP2C9 alleles when administering diclofena.
CYP2E1 is a versatile phase I drug-metabolizing enzyme responsible for the biotransformation of most volatile organic compounds, including toluene. Human toluene exposure increases CYP2E1 mRNA and modifies its activity in leucocytes; however, epigenetic implications of this interaction have not been investigated.
TUSC3 interacts with the protein phosphatase 1 and magnesium ion transport system, which plays an important role in learning and memory. Abnormal conditions of learning and memory are common clinical characteristics of mental retardation (MR). However, the association of TUSC3 genetic polymorphisms with MR remains unknown. A total of 456 DNA samples including 174 nuclear families containing MR were collected in the Qinba mountain area of China. The genotypes of eight tag single nucleotide polymorphisms of TUSC3 were evaluated with traditional genetic methods. Family-based association tests, transmission disequilibrium tests (TDTs), and haplotype relative risk (HRR) analyses were performed to investigate the association between genetic variants of the TUSC3 gene and MR. The genetic polymorphisms rs10093881, rs6530893, and rs6994908 were associated with MR (all P values <0.05) based upon the results of single-site TDT and HRR analyses. The haplotype block consisting of rs6530893 and rs6994908, harboring the sixth exon of TUSC3, was also associated with MR (all P values <0.05). This study demonstrated an association between genetic polymorphisms of the TUSC3 gene and MR in the Qinba mountain area, the sixth exon of which might contribute to the risk of MR. However, further studies are needed on the causal mechanisms in this association. 
GNE myopathy is an autosomal recessive adult-onset disorder characterized by progressive muscle atrophy and weakness, initially involving the distal muscles, while often sparing the quadriceps. It is caused by variants in the GNE gene that encodes a key bifunctional enzyme in the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway. We investigated the clinical and molecular characteristics of 18 non-Jewish Persian patients from 11 unrelated GNE myopathy families. In addition, we reviewed the previously reported cases and suggest genotype-phenotype correlations for the identified variants. Comprehensive clinical and laboratory evaluations were carried out. Sequencing of the GNE gene was performed using genomic DNA from the patients. Screening of the identified variants was performed in all relevant family members. Molecular analyses identified three causative homozygous GNE variants in 11 families: c.2228T>C (p. M743T) in 7, c.830G>A (p.R277Q) in 2, and one novel variation (c.804G>A) in 2 families that results in a synonymous codon change (p.L268=) and likely creates a novel splice site affecting the protein function. This study confirms that c.2228T>C (p.M743T) is the most prevalent disease-causing variant in the non-Jewish Persian population, but other GNE variants can cause GNE myopathy in this population. The patients with all three different variants had similar ages of onset. The youngest patient was an 18-year-old girl in whom the c.830G>A (p.R277Q) variant was identified, whereas the oldest onset age (31 years) was seen in a male patient with c.804G>A (p.L268=). The results of this investigation expand our knowledge about the genotype-phenotype correlations in GNE myopathy and aid in clinical management and therapeutic interventions. 
ITPA polymorphisms have been associated with protection against ribavirin-induced anemia in chronic hepatitis C (HCV) patients. Here we determined the association of inosine triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (inosine triphosphatase or ITPase) enzyme activity with ITPA genotype in predicting ribavirin-induced anemia.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the PI3 K-AKT signaling pathway which is involved in the pathogenesis of many different tumor types and serves as a prognostic marker in breast cancer. However, the significance of the role of PTEN in Middle Eastern ethnic breast cancer has not been explored especially with the fact that breast cancer originating from this ethnic population tend to behave more aggressively than breast cancer in the west. In this study, we analyzed PTEN alteration in a tissue microarray format containing more than 1000 primary breast cancers with clinical follow-up data. Tissue Microarray sections were analyzed for protein expression and copy number change using immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Loss of PTEN immunostaining was observed in 77 % of the cases. PTEN loss was significantly associated with large tumor size (p = 0.0030), high grade (p = 0.0281), tumor recurrence (p = 0.0333), and triple-negative breast cancers (p = 0.0086). PTEN loss in triple-negative breast cancers was significantly associated with rapid tumor cell proliferation (p = 0.0396) and poor prognosis (p = 0.0408). PTEN deletion was found only in 60 cases (6.4 %). Loss of PTEN protein expression occurs at high frequency in Middle Eastern breast cancer. PTEN inactivation may potentially lead to an aggressive behavior of tumor cells through stimulation of tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, PTEN signaling pathway might be used as potential therapeutic target in triple-negative breast cancers since loss of its expression is shown to be significantly associated with this aggressive subtype of breast cancer. 
GNE myopathy is an autosomal recessive distal myopathy caused by biallelic mutation in the GNE gene. It shows great genetic heterogeneity among different ethnic groups. In this study, we summarized the mutational spectrum and clinical profiles in 35 unrelated GNE myopathy patients from mainland China. Molecular analysis revealed 16 novel (p.G47D, p.F66Y, p.E173A, p.Y186H, p.R246L, p.R263*, p.R306*, p.A366D, p.V512M, p.C520Y, p.G545R, p.G548S, p.V622G, p.A638P, IVS2+1G>A and c.2112delC) and 13 reported mutations. Notably, the p.D176V mutation was detected in 65.7% (23/35) of this patient cohort, giving an allele frequency of 34.3% (24/70). We estimated the carrier frequency of p.D176V to be 0.19% (1/520) in the normal population, although haplotype analysis indicated no founder effect in the patients carrying p.D176V mutation. Clinically, 29 patients presented with the classic phenotype of predominant distal weakness, while six patients presented with atypical phenotype. However, muscle magnetic resonance imaging showed that the vastus lateralis was spared in both subgroups. In conclusion, p.D176V mutation in the GNE gene, which was the second most common mutation in Japanese patients, was the most common mutation in this cohort of Chinese patients. Novel GNE mutations found in this study expanded the mutational spectrum associated with GNE myopathy. There is phenotypic heterogeneity among patients with GNE myopathy, but muscle magnetic resonance imaging can be useful for differential diagnosis.
PTEN gene at chromosomes 10q23.3 is a tumour suppressor gene that is inactivated in many types of human cancers. The known mechanisms of PTEN inactivation are rendered to mutation, epigenetic silencing by aberrant methylation or gene deletion. Although PTEN role has been documented in many cancers, PTEN alteration in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study is to comprehensively investigate PTEN alterations in a large cohort of Middle Eastern papillary thyroid cancer by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH).
CYP2C9 is the key enzyme in aromatic antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) metabolism. CYP2C9*3 is a loss of function polymorphism. This study was designed to investigate genetic association between CYP2C9*3 and aromatic AED-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) in Thai children. The 37 aromatic AED-induced SCARs patients (20 phenobarbital and 17 phenytoin) and 35 tolerances (19 phenobarbital and 16 phenytoin) were enrolled. CYP2C9*3 was genotyped by allele-specific PCRs. The association between CYP2C9*3 with phenytoin-induced SCARs and phenobarbital-induced SCARs were analyzed in comparison with tolerances and healthy samples. Significant association between phenytoin-induced SCARs and CYP2C9*3 was discovered (odds ratio=14.52; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.18-∞, P-value=0.044). CYP2C9*3 was not associated with phenobarbital-induced SCARs. This study is the first report of CYP2C9*3 association to phenytoin-induced SCARs in Thai epileptic children. The CYP2C9*3 is a reasonable predictive genetic marker to anticipate SCARs from phenytoin. 
PIK3CA gene is frequently mutated in patients with breast cancer and it has been the focus of intense research. Inhibitors of PI3K pathway are being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials but the impact of PIKC3A mutation status on tumor response is yet uncertain. In the metastatic setting, several studies are evaluating the predictive value of PIK3CA mutations. However, results could be biased by biopsy localization. Digital polymerase chain reaction is a new technology that enables detection and quantification of cancer DNA molecules from peripheral blood and can potentially overcome such situation. As a proof of the concept, we present the case of a metastatic patient with a PIK3CA wild-type primary tumor in which the PIK3CA E545K mutation was identified in both the circulating-free DNA obtained from a peripheral blood sample and in the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver metastasis.
ATP1A2 and ATP1A3 are genes that code for catalytic subunits of Na/K-ATPases, which play important roles in the basal electrophysiological states of nerve cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms of ATP1A2 and ATP1A3 influence susceptibility to genetic generalized epilepsies (GGEs) and the efficacy of anti-epileptic drugs in a Chinese population.
PDE4B was previously shown to be a dominant PDE4 subtype of neutrophils. However, its physiological role in the neutrophil function has not been evaluated. In this study, the inhibitory effects of a phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B)- selective inhibitor (compound A) and subtype non-selective PDE4 inhibitors (roflumilast and cilomilast) were evaluated in human peripheral blood cells. Compound A, roflumilast and cilomilast in a similar manner inhibited TNF-α production by LPS-stimulated human mononuclear cells. However, the inhibitory effect of compound A on IL-8 or LTB4-induced chemotactic response of neutrophils was modest even at the highest concentration (10 μmol L(-1)), whereas roflumilast and cilomilast inhibited IL-8 or LTB4-induced neutrophil chemotaxis. Our results suggest that PDE4B does not play an important role during the chemotactic response of human neutrophils.
CD38 is a multifunctional membrane enzyme and the main mammalian ADP-ribosyl cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis and hydrolysis of cADPR, a potent endogenous Ca(2+) mobilizing messenger. Here, we explored the role of CD38 in the neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We found that the expression of CD38 was decreased during the differentiation of mouse ESCs initiated by adherent monoculture. Perturbing the CD38/cADPR signaling by either CD38 knockdown or treatment of cADPR antagonists inhibited the neural commitment of mouse ESCs, whereas overexpression of CD38 promoted it. Moreover, CD38 knockdown dampened reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during neural differentiation of ESCs by inhibiting NADPH oxidase activity, while CD38 overexpression enhanced it. Similarly, application of hydrogen peroxide mitigated the inhibitory effects of CD38 knockdown on neural differentiation of ESCs. Taken together, our data indicate that the CD38 signaling pathway is required for neural differentiation of mouse ESCs by modulating ROS production.
CYP2C19 rs12769205 alters an intron 2 branch point adenine leading to an alternative mRNA in human liver with complete inclusion of intron 2 (exon 2B). rs12769205 changes the mRNA reading frame, introduces 87 amino acids, and leads to a premature stop codon. The 1000 Genomes project (http://browser.1000genomes.org/index.html) indicated rs12769205 is in linkage disequilibrium with rs4244285 on CYP2C19*2, but found alone on CYP2C19*35 in Blacks. Minigenes containing rs12769205 transfected into HepG2 cells demonstrated this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alone leads to exon 2B and decreases CYP2C19 canonical mRNA. A residual amount of CYP2C19 protein was detectable by quantitative proteomics with tandem mass spectrometry in CYP2C19*2/*2 and *1/*35 liver microsomes with an exon 2 probe. However, an exon 4 probe, downstream from rs12769205, but upstream of rs4244285, failed to detect CYP2C19 protein in livers homozygous for rs12769205, demonstrating rs12769205 alone can lead to complete loss of CYP2C19 protein. CYP2C19 genotypes and mephenytoin phenotype were compared in 104 Ethiopians. Poor metabolism of mephenytoin was seen in persons homozygous for both rs12769205 and rs4244285 (CYP2C19*2/*2), but with little effect on mephenytoin disposition of CYP2C19*1/*2, CYP2C19*1/*3, or CYP2C19*1/*35 heterozygous alleles. Extended haplotype homozygosity tests of the HapMap Yorubans (YRI) showed both haplotypes carrying rs12769205 (CYP2C19*35 and CYP2C19*2) are under significant natural selection, with CYP2C19*35 having a higher relative extended haplotype homozygosity score. The phylogenetic tree of the YRI CYP2C19 haplotypes revealed rs12769205 arose first on CYP2C19*35 and that rs4244285 was added later, creating CYP2C19*2. In conclusion, rs12769205 is the ancestral polymorphism leading to aberrant splicing of CYP2C19*35 and CYP2C19*2 alleles in liver. 
MTHFR C677T polymorphism has been indicated to be a risk factor for cancers, but its association with head and neck cancer (HNC) risk remains inconclusive. In the present study, we aimed to get a more precise estimation by performing a quantitative meta-analysis. Published papers up to Jun 2014 was searched and screened. Necessary information was rigorously extracted for data pooling and analyzing, and then, subgroup analyses on ethnicity, source of controls, sample size, tumor type, smoking and drinking status were also carried out. As a result, twenty-three case-control studies including 14298 subjects were included. The overall data failed to reveal a significant association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and HNC risk (homozygote comparison model: OR = 1.16; 95%CI = 0.93-1.45; dominant model: OR = 1.05; 95%CI =  .90-1.21; recessive model: OR = 1.14; 95%CI = 0.93-1.38). However, in the subgroup analysis about drinking status, increase risk was shown in the heavy drinking subgroup (TT vs CC: OR = 3.11; 95%CI = 1.52-3.02). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that Homozygous TT alleles of MTHFR C677T polymorphism might be a risk factor for HNC among individuals who have a heavy drinking history. Further studies are needed to get a more definitive conclusion.
ALOX12 and ALOX15 encode arachidonate lipoxygenases which produce lipid metabolites involved in inflammatory processes. Metabolites generated by ALOX12 and ALOX15 can activate the expression of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, and produce endogenous ligands for PPARG. In this study, polymorphisms in ALOX12, ALOX15, IL6 and PPARG were investigated for association with bone properties in young and elderly Swedish women.
CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme for the synthesis of Ca(2+) second messengers. Glucagon promotes hepatic glucose production through Ca(2+) signaling in the fasting condition. In this study, we investigated the role of CD38 in the glucagon signaling of hepatocytes. Here, we show that glucagon induces cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) production and sustained Ca(2+) increases via CD38 in hepatocytes. 8-Br-cADPR, an antagonistic cADPR analog, completely blocked glucagon-induced Ca(2+) increases and phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Moreover, glucagon-induced sustained Ca(2+) signals and translocation of CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 to the nucleus were absent and glucagon-induced glucose production and expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) are remarkably reduced in hepatocytes from CD38(-/-) mice. Furthermore, in the fasting condition, CD38(-/-) mice have decreased blood glucose and hepatic expression of G6Pase and Pck1 compared to wild type mice. Our data suggest that CD38/cADPR-mediated Ca(2+) signals play a key role in glucagon-induced gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes, and that the signal pathway has significant clinical implications in metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes. 
CA1 hippocampal interneurons at the border between stratum radiatum (SR) and stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) have AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) that consist of two distinct phases: a typical fast component (FC), and a highly unusual slow component (SC) that persists for hundreds of milliseconds. To determine whether these kinetically distinct components of the EPSC are mediated by distinct AMPAR subpopulations, we examined the relative contributions of GluA2-containing and-lacking AMPARs to the SC. GluA2-containing AMPARs mediated the majority of the FC whereas GluA2-lacking AMPARs preferentially generated the SC. When glutamate uptake through the glial glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT1) was inhibited, spill over-mediated AMPAR activation recruited an even slower third kinetic component that persisted for several seconds; however, this spillover-mediated current was mediated predominantly by GluA2-containing AMPARs and therefore was clearly distinct from the SC when uptake is intact. Thus, different AMPAR subpopulations that vary in GluA2 content mediate the distinct components of the AMPAR EPSC. The SC is developmentally downregulated in mice, declining after the second postnatal week. This downregulation affects both GluA2-containing and GluA2-lacking AMPARs mediating the SC, and is not accompanied by developmental changes in the GluA2 content of AMPARs underlying the FC. Thus, the downregulation of the SC appears to be independent of synaptic GluA2 expression, suggesting the involvement of another AMPAR subunit or an auxiliary protein. Our results therefore identify GluA2-dependent and GluA2-independent determinants of the SC: GluA2-lacking AMPARs preferentially contribute to the SC, while the developmental downregulation of the SC is independent of GluA2 content. 
ABO incompatibility of red blood cells leads to brisk complement-mediated lysis, particularly in the setting of red cell transfusion. The ABO blood group is the most clinically significant blood group because of preformed immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies to ABO blood group antigens (isohemagglutinins) in everyone except group AB individuals. In addition to transfusion, ABO incompatibility can cause hemolysis in hematopoietic and solid organ transplantation, hemolytic disease of the newborn, and intravenous immunoglobulin infusion. It is important to prevent ABO incompatibility when possible and to anticipate complications when ABO incompatibility is unavoidable. 
ABO blood groups have long been associated with cardiovascular disease, thrombosis, and acute coronary syndromes. Many studies over the years have shown type O blood group to be associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease than non-type O blood groups. However, the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Although ABO blood group is associated with variations in concentrations of circulating von Willebrand Factor and other endothelial cell adhesion molecules, ABO antigens are also present on several platelet surface glycoproteins and glycosphingolipids. As we highlight in this platelet-centric review, these glycomic modifications may affect platelet function in arterial thrombosis. More broadly, improving our understanding of the role of platelet glycan modifications in acute coronary syndromes may inform future diagnostics and therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases. 
CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 are highly homologous genes that can form chimera following unequal crossing-over during meiosis. A chimeric CYP11B1/CYP11B2 gene causes glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA), while the rare CYP11B2/CYP11B1 chimeric gene leads to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency (11-OHD). The aim of the study was to find the underlying genetic causes of three distinct Chinese pedigrees with 11-OHD. The family history, clinical data, laboratory findings and alterations in the CYP11B1 gene sequence were analyzed in all patients. We found that patient 1 and patient 2 harbored novel homozygotic chimeric CYP11B2/CYP11B1 genes consisting of the promoter, exons 1-6 of CYP11B2, and exons 7-9 of CYP11B1. Patient 3 had compound heterozygotic mutation with one allele containing the promoter and exons 1-6 of CYP11B2 and exons 7-9 of CYP11B1, and the other allele comprising novel, previously undescribed p.W56X (c.168G>A) mutation in exon 1 of CYP11B1. The breakpoints to form Chimeric CYP11B2/CYP11B1 were not the same for the three patients. Rare chimeric CYP11B2/CYP11B1 gene mutations are the underlying cause of disease in three patients with 11-OHD. We hypothesize that the lack expression of CYP11B1 under the control of the CYP11B2 promoter in zona fasciculata may contribute to a cortisol defect as well as the resultant 11-OHD. 
CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic gene which encodes the (CYP2D6) enzyme, involved in the metabolism of 20-25% of all clinically prescribed drugs and other xenobiotics in the human body. CYP2D6 genotyping is recommended prior to treatment decisions involving one or more of the numerous drugs sensitive to CYP2D6 allelic composition. In this context, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies provide a promising time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to currently used genotyping techniques. To achieve accurate interpretation of HTS data, however, one needs to overcome several obstacles such as high sequence similarity and genetic recombinations between CYP2D6 and evolutionarily related pseudogenes CYP2D7 and CYP2D8, high copy number variation among individuals and short read lengths generated by HTS technologies.
BSG was milled and sieved and six different grain fractions of different particle sizes (PS) were obtained: PS ≤ 63 μm (PSA); 63 μm < PS ≤ 90 μm (PSB); 90 μm<PS ≤ 125 μm (PSC); 125 μm < PS ≤ 180 μm (PSD); 180 μm<PS ≤250 μm (PSE) and PS>250 μm (PSF). SEM images showed that for the highest particle sizes, cells were still intact while for the smallest particles disruption of cells occurred. The sugar analysis of the grains showed the constant presence of arabinoxylans (AX) and the maximum amount was observed in PSC. AX rich extracts were obtained for all grain fractions presenting different estimate degrees of polymerisation (DP) and degrees of branching (DB). With the decreasing of grain PS, smallest and more branched polymers were extracted; the smallest AX in PSC, and the more branched AX in PSA and PSB. Residual arabinogalactans (AG) were extracted from PSD to PSA. Starch was present in all extracts accounting for 8-10% of the composition of the extract. AX rich extracts with different DP and DB were obtained from different grain PS.
RRM2B is a critical ribonucleotide reductase (RR) subunit that exists as p53-inducible and p53-dependent molecule. The p53-independent regulation of RRM2B has been recently studied, and FOXO3 was identified as a novel regulator of RRM2B. However, the p53-independent regulation of RRM2B, particularly under oxidative stress, remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of RRM2B underoxidative stress-induced DNA damage and further examined the regulation of mitochondrial and inflammatory genes by RRM2B. Our study is the first to report the critical role of RRM2B in mitochondrial homeostasis and the inflammation signaling pathway in a p53-independent manner. Furthermore, our study provides novel insights into the role of the RR in inflammatory diseases. 
ABCA1 -565C/T gene promoter variants have been associated with the severity of coronary artery disease in Western populations. The purpose of our study was to investigate the association between the -565C/T gene polymorphism and coronary artery disease severity and cholesterol efflux in the Chinese Han population.
WHSC1 is a histone methyltransferase (HMT) that catalyses the addition of methyl groups to lysine 36 on histone 3. In humans, WHSC1 haploinsufficiency is associated with all known cases of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS). The cardinal feature of WHS is a craniofacial dysmorphism, which is accompanied by sensorineural hearing loss in 15% of individuals with WHS. Here, we show that WHSC1-deficient mice display craniofacial defects that overlap with WHS, including cochlea anomalies. Although auditory hair cells are specified normally, their stereocilia hair bundles required for sound perception fail to develop the appropriate morphology. Furthermore, the orientation and cellular organisation of cochlear hair cells and their innervation are defective. These findings identify, for the first time, the likely cause of sensorineural hearing loss in individuals with WHS. 
RRM1 is the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the production of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) and is essential for DNA synthesis and repair. Through a meta-analysis of observational studies, we evaluated whether RRM1 expression levels are associated with the clinical outcome of gemcitabine-containing treatment regimens in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
CYP19A1 aromatase is a member of the Cytochrome P450 family of hemeproteins, and is the enzyme responsible for the final step of the androgens conversion into the corresponding estrogens, via a three-step oxidative process. For this reason, the inhibition of this enzyme plays an important role in the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer. The first catalytic subcycle, corresponding to the hydroxilation of androstenedione, has been proposed to occur through a first hydrogen abstraction and a subsequent oxygen rebound step. In present work, we have studied the mechanism of the first catalytic subcycle by means of hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods. The inclusion of the protein flexibility has been achieved by means of Free Energy Perturbation techniques, giving rise to a free energy of activation for the hydrogen abstraction step of 13.5 kcal/mol. The subsequent oxygen rebound step, characterized by a small free energy barrier (1.5 kcal/mol), leads to the hydroxylated products through a highly exergonic reaction. In addition, an analysis of the primary deuterium kinetic isotopic effects, calculated for the hydrogen abstraction step, reveals values (∼10) overpassing the semiclassical limit for the CH, indicating the presence of a substantial tunnel effect. Finally, a decomposition analysis of the interaction energy for the substrate and cofactor in the active site is also discussed. According to our results, the role of the enzymatic environment consists of a transition state stabilization by means of dispersive and polarization effects.
CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 are polymorphic enzymes that metabolise several compounds of clinical importance. This study investigated the prevalent phenotypes of these enzymes and the influence of age and sex on enzyme activity in a Nigerian population.
ABCC9 genetic polymorphisms are associated with increased risk for various human diseases including hippocampal sclerosis of aging. The main goals of this study were 1 > to detect the ABCC9 variants and define the specific 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) for each variant in human brain, and 2 > to determine whether a polymorphism (rs704180) associated with risk for hippocampal sclerosis of aging pathology is also associated with variation in ABCC9 transcript expression and/or splicing. Rapid amplification of ABCC9 cDNA ends (3'RACE) provided evidence of novel 3' UTR portions of ABCC9 in human brain. In silico and experimental studies were performed focusing on the single nucleotide polymorphism, rs704180. Analyses from multiple databases, focusing on rs704180 only, indicated that this risk allele is a local expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL). Analyses of RNA from human brains showed increased ABCC9 transcript levels in individuals with the risk genotype, corresponding with enrichment for a shorter 3' UTR which may be more stable than variants with the longer 3' UTR. MicroRNA transfection experiments yielded results compatible with the hypothesis that miR-30c causes down-regulation of SUR2 transcripts with the longer 3' UTR. Thus we report evidence of complex ABCC9 genetic regulation in brain, which may be of direct relevance to human disease. ABCC9 gene variants are associated with increased risk for hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging--a prevalent brain disease with symptoms that mimic Alzheimer's disease). We describe novel ABCC9 variants in human brain, corresponding to altered 3'UTR length, which could lead to targeting by miR-30c. We also determined that the HS-Aging risk mutation is associated with variation in ABCC9 transcript expression.
CD36 is an important transporter of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) in the myocardium. As we have reported previously, CD36-deficient patients demonstrate a marked reduction in myocardial uptake of (123)I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-(R, S)-methyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP), which is an analog of LCFAs, while myocardial (18)F-fluorodeoxy-glucose (FDG) uptake is increased. However, it has not been clarified whether energy provision is preserved in patients with CD36 deficiency. The aims of the current study were to investigate the myocardial uptake of glucose and alterations in myocardial metabolites in wild-type (WT) and CD36 knockout (KO) mice.
PTEN (10q23.3) is a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3)/Akt survival pathway and a tumor suppressor frequently deleted in prostate cancer. PTEN genomic deletion is among the most common genetic aberrations in human prostate cancer. At present, the prognostic value of PTEN genomic deletion is unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association between PTEN genomic deletion and a higher Gleason score or a higher possibility of capsular penetration. A comprehensive, computerized literature search of PubMed was carried out until May 27, 2014. Studies were included according to specific inclusion criteria. Pooled hazard ratio was estimated using the fixed effects model or random effects model according to heterogeneity between studies. Seven eligible studies meeting the specific inclusion criteria were selected for further analysis; all were retrospective studies. Overall meta-analysis demonstrated that PTEN genomic deletion was associated with a higher Gleason score (OR 0.319; 95% confidence interval: 0.153-0.666; P = 0.000) and a higher possibility of capsular penetration (OR 0.393; 95% confidence interval: 0.185-0.837; P = 0.015). None of the studies materially altered the original results and no evidence of publication bias was found.
PTEN is a dual specificity phosphatase and is implicated in inflammation and apoptosis of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury. Bisperoxovanadium (Bpv), a specific inhibitor of PTEN's phosphatase activity, has demonstrated powerful neuroprotective properties. We investigated the neuroprotective roles of Bpv in the rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) cerebral I/R injury, and explored the modulation of inflammatory mediators and PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β pathways by Bpv. Our results showed that treatment with Bpv (0.2 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased neurological deficit scores at 7 days after MCAO and infarct volume at 4 days after MCAO. The IL-10 concentration was increased and TNF-α concentration was decreased in the ischemic boundary zone of the cerebral cortex at 4 days after MCAO by Bpv. Furthermore, Bpv (0.2 mg/kg/day) treatment significantly reduced PTEN mRNA and protein levels and increased PI3K, Akt and p-GSK-3β proteins expression in the ischemic boundary zone of the cerebral cortex at 4 days after MCAO. In conclusions, Bpv treatment demonstrates neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury of ischemic stroke rats and is associated with its modulation of inflammatory mediator production and up-regulation of PTEN downstream proteins PI3K, Akt and p-GSK-3β.
INPP4B acts as a tumor suppressor in various epithelial cancers by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling. Unexpectedly, tumor-promoting features of INPP4B in leukemia and breast cancer have been recently uncovered. In this spotlight, we discuss the seemingly paradoxical nature of INPP4B-mediated signaling in cancer. 
SLC34A2 with highest expressions in lung, small intestine and kidney encoded a type 2b sodium-dependent phosphate transporter (NaPi-IIb). In lung, SLC34A2 only expressed in the apical membrane of type II alveolar epithelium cells (ATII cells) and played a pivotal role during the fetal lung development and embryonic development. ATII cells acting as multifunctional stem cells might transform into NSCLC after undergoing exogenous or endogenous factors. Increasing evidences showed that the genes performing critical roles during embryogenesis were also expressed during the development of cancer. In addition, recent research found the expression of SLC34A2 had a significant difference between the surgical samples of NSCLC and normal tissues, and SLC34A2 was down-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and up-regulation expression of SLC34A2 could significantly inhibit cell viability and invasion of A549 in vitro. These results suggested SLC34A2 might play an important role in the development of NSCLC. However, the role of SLC34A2 in tumorigenesis and progression of NSCLC remains unknown.
FADS1 (fatty acid desaturase 1) plays a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism, and it was recently reported to be involved in tumorigenesis. However, the role of FADS1 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unknown. In the current study, we investigated the expression and clinical pathologic and prognostic significance of FADS1 in ESCC. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that 58.2% (146/251) of the ESCC tissues had low levels of FADS1 expression, whereas 41.8% (105/251) exhibited high levels of FADS1 expression. In positive cases, FADS1 expression was detected in the cytoplasm of cells. Correlation analyses demonstrated that FADS1 expression was significantly correlated with tumor location (p=0.025) but not with age, gender, histological grade, tumor status, nodal status or TNM staging. Furthermore, patients with tumors expressing high levels of FADS1had a longer disease-free survival time (p<0.001) and overall survival time (p<0.001). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that, along with nodal status, FADS1 expression was an independent and significant predictive factor (p<0.001). In conclusion, our study suggested that FADS1 might be a valuable biomarker and potential therapeutic target for ESCC.
SLC2A9 gene variants have been associated with urinary uric acid (UA) concentration, but little is known about the functional mechanism linking these gene variants with UA. SLC2A9 encodes a UA transporter present in the proximal tubule of the kidney, and gene expression levels of SLC2A9 and other genes in the uricosuric pathway (ABCG2, SLC17A1, SLC17A3, and SLC22A12) could potentially mediate the relationship between SLC2A9 gene variants and urinary UA excretion.
SLC6A14 mediates Na(+)/Cl(-)-coupled concentrative uptake of a broad-spectrum of amino acids. It is expressed at low levels in many tissues but up-regulated in certain cancers. Pharmacological blockade of SLC6A14 causes amino acid starvation in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer cells and suppresses their proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we interrogated the role of this transporter in breast cancer by deleting Slc6a14 in mice and monitoring the consequences of this deletion in models of spontaneous breast cancer (Polyoma middle T oncogene-transgenic mouse and mouse mammary tumour virus promoter-Neu-transgenic mouse). Slc6a14-knockout mice are viable, fertile and phenotypically normal. The plasma amino acids were similar in wild-type and knockout mice and there were no major compensatory changes in the expression of other amino acid transporter mRNAs. There was also no change in mammary gland development in the knockout mouse. However, when crossed with PyMT-Tg mice or MMTV/Neu (mouse mammary tumour virus promoter-Neu)-Tg mice, the development and progression of breast cancer were markedly decreased on Slc6a14(-/-) background. Analysis of transcriptomes in tumour tissues from wild-type mice and Slc6a14-null mice indicated no compensatory changes in the expression of any other amino acid transporter mRNA. However, the tumours from the null mice showed evidence of amino acid starvation, decreased mTOR signalling and decreased cell proliferation. These studies demonstrate that SLC6A14 is critical for the maintenance of amino acid nutrition and optimal mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling in ER+ breast cancer and that the transporter is a potential target for development of a novel class of anti-cancer drugs targeting amino acid nutrition in tumour cells. 
PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) is a hereditary disorder caused by germline inactivating mutations of the PTEN gene. PHTS includes Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. We describe how the peculiar pathologic and immunohistochemical thyroid features lead pathologists to suggest PHTS.
CD36 is a transmembrane protein that is involved in the recognition of certain amphiphilic molecules such as polar lipids in various tissues and body fluids. So far, CD36 homologues in insects have been demonstrated to be present on the surface of olfactory dendrites and to participate in the perception of exogenous compounds. However, little is known about the relationship between CD36 and mammalian olfaction. Indeed, the detection of only CD36 mRNA in the mouse olfactory epithelium has been reported to date. In the present study, to provide potential pieces of evidence for the involvement of CD36 in mammalian olfactory perception, we extensively investigated the localisation of this protein in the mouse olfactory mucosa. In situ hybridisation analysis using antisense oligonucleotides to CD36 mRNA detected aggregated signals within the deeper epithelial layer of olfactory mucosa. The mRNA signals were also detected consistently in the superficial layer of the olfactory epithelium, which is occupied by supporting cells. Immunostaining with an anti-CD36 polyclonal antibody revealed that CD36 localises in the somata and dendrites of distinct olfactory receptor cells and that it occurs abundantly on the olfactory epithelial surface. However, immunoreactive CD36 was rarely detectable in the nerve bundles running in the lamina propria of olfactory mucosa, the axons forming the olfactory nerve layer in the outermost layer of the bulb and axon terminals in the glomeruli. We also obtained electron microscopic evidence for the association of CD36 protein with olfactory cilia. Altogether, we suggest that CD36 plays a role in the mammalian olfaction. In addition, signals for CD36 protein were also detected on or around the microvilli of olfactory supporting cells and the cilia of nasal respiratory epithelium, suggesting a role for this protein other than olfaction in the nasal cavity. 
IDO1 (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1) is a member of a unique class of mammalian haem dioxygenases that catalyse the oxidative catabolism of the least-abundant essential amino acid, L-Trp (L-tryptophan), along the kynurenine pathway. Significant increases in knowledge have been recently gained with respect to understanding the fundamental biochemistry of IDO1 including its catalytic reaction mechanism, the scope of enzyme reactions it catalyses, the biochemical mechanisms controlling IDO1 expression and enzyme activity, and the discovery of enzyme inhibitors. Major advances in understanding the roles of IDO1 in physiology and disease have also been realised. IDO1 is recognised as a prominent immune regulatory enzyme capable of modulating immune cell activation status and phenotype via several molecular mechanisms including enzyme-dependent deprivation of L-Trp and its conversion into the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand kynurenine and other bioactive kynurenine pathway metabolites, or non-enzymatic cell signalling actions involving tyrosine phosphorylation of IDO1. Through these different modes of biochemical signalling, IDO1 regulates certain physiological functions (e.g. pregnancy) and modulates the pathogenesis and severity of diverse conditions including chronic inflammation, infectious disease, allergic and autoimmune disorders, transplantation, neuropathology and cancer. In the present review, we detail the current understanding of IDO1's catalytic actions and the biochemical mechanisms regulating IDO1 expression and activity. We also discuss the biological functions of IDO1 with a focus on the enzyme's immune-modulatory function, its medical implications in diverse pathological settings and its utility as a therapeutic target. 
DGAT1 enzymes (acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, EC 2.3.1.20) catalyse the formation of triacylglycerols (TAGs), the most abundant lipids in vegetable oils. Thorough understanding of the enzymology of oil accumulation is critical to the goal of modifying oilseeds for improved vegetable oil production. Four isoforms of BnDGAT1, the final and rate-limiting step in triacylglycerol synthesis, were characterized from Brassica napus, one of the world's most important oilseed crops. Transcriptional profiling of developing B. napus seeds indicated two genes, BnDGAT1-1 and BnDGAT1-2, with high expression and two, BnDGAT1-3 and BnDGAT1-4, with low expression. The activities of each BnDGAT1 isozyme were characterized following expression in a strain of yeast deficient in TAG synthesis. TAG from B. napus seeds contain only 10% palmitic acid (16:0) at the sn-3 position, so it was surprising that all four BnDGAT1 isozymes exhibited strong (4- to 7-fold) specificity for 16:0 over oleic acid (18:1) as the acyl-CoA substrate. However, the ratio of 18:1-CoA to 16:0-CoA in B. napus seeds during the peak period of TAG synthesis is 3:1. When substrate selectivity assays were conducted with 18:1-CoA and 16:0-CoA in a 3:1 ratio, the four isozymes incorporated 18:1 in amounts 2- to 5-fold higher than 16:0. This strong sensitivity of the BnDGAT1 isozymes to the relative concentrations of acyl-CoA substrates substantially explains the observed fatty acid composition of B. napus seed oil. Understanding these enzymes that are critical for triacylglycerol synthesis will facilitate genetic and biotechnological manipulations to improve this oilseed crop. 
LCAT is intimately involved in HDL maturation and is a key component of the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway which removes excess cholesterol molecules from the peripheral tissues to the liver for excretion. Patients with loss-of-function LCAT mutations exhibit low levels of HDL cholesterol and corneal opacity. Here we report the 2.65 Å crystal structure of the human LCAT protein. Crystallization required enzymatic removal of N-linked glycans and complex formation with a Fab fragment from a tool antibody. The crystal structure reveals that LCAT has an α/β hydrolase core with two additional subdomains that play important roles in LCAT function. Subdomain 1 contains the region of LCAT shown to be required for interfacial activation, while subdomain 2 contains the lid and amino acids that shape the substrate binding pocket. Mapping the naturally occurring mutations onto the structure provides insight into how they may affect LCAT enzymatic activity. 
DOT1L has emerged as an anticancer target for MLL-associated leukaemias; however, its functional role in solid tumours is largely unknown. Here we identify that DOT1L cooperates with c-Myc and p300 acetyltransferase to epigenetically activate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulators in breast cancer progression. DOT1L recognizes SNAIL, ZEB1 and ZEB2 promoters via interacting with the c-Myc-p300 complex and facilitates lysine-79 methylation and acetylation towards histone H3, leading to the dissociation of HDAC1 and DNMT1 in the regions. The upregulation of these EMT regulators by the DOT1L-c-Myc-p300 complex enhances EMT-induced breast cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties. Furthermore, in vivo orthotopic xenograft models show that DOT1L is required for malignant transformation of breast epithelial cells and breast tumour initiation and metastasis. Clinically, DOT1L expression is associated with poorer survival and aggressiveness of breast cancers. Collectively, we suggest that cooperative effect of DOT1L and c-Myc-p300 is critical for acquisition of aggressive phenotype of breast cancer by promoting EMT/CSC. 
PLCG2 associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation (PLAID) is a complex dominantly inherited disease characterized almost universally by cold urticaria, and variably by recurrent bacterial infection, autoimmunty and skin granuloma formation. Several striking phenotypes can emerge from this disease, and the pathophysiology leads to a complex mix of loss and gain of function in cellular signaling. This review discusses the key phenotypic characteristics and pathophysiologic observations seen in PLAID, and contrasts PLAID to several related disorders in order to best contextualize this fascinating disease. 
CYP21A2 mutation analysis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is challenging because of the genomic presence of a homologous CYP21A2 pseudogene and the significant incidence of pseudogene conversion and large deletions. The objective of this study was to accurately analyze the CYP21A2 genotype in Korean CAH patients using a combination of complementary methods. Long-range PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses were performed to confirm valid amplification of CYP21A2 and to detect large gene conversions and deletions before direct sequencing. Multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis was conducted concurrently in 14 CAH-suspected patients and six family members of three patients. We identified 27 CYP21A2 mutant alleles in 14 CAH-suspected patients. The c.293-13A>G (or c.293-13C>G) was the most common mutation, and p.Ile173Asn was the second, identified in 25% and 17.9% of alleles, respectively. A novel frame-shift mutation of c.492delA (p.Glu 164Aspfs*24) was detected. Large deletions were detected by MLPA in 10.7% of the alleles. Mutation studies of the six familial members for three of the patients aided in the identification of haplotypes. In summary, we successfully identified CYP21A2 mutations using both long-range PCR and sequencing and dosage analyses. Our data correspond relatively well with the previously reported mutation spectrum analysis. 
FH is a genetic disorder characterized by an increase in serum LDL and total cholesterol values. The afflicted patients are at increased risk of premature atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Different treatment modalities are present, including pharmacological agents and surgical procedures. The most effective method of therapy in refractive cases is liver transplantation. Herein, we report our experience on 36 cases of patients with FH undergoing liver transplantation in our center, the main referral center of liver transplantation in Iran. The clinical findings, hospital courses, post-operative complications, and patient follow-up are also described. 
PTEN gene inactivation by mutation or deletion is common in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), but the impact on outcome is unclear, particularly in patients with NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations. We screened samples from 145 patients treated on the MRC UKALL2003 trial for PTEN mutations using heteroduplex analysis and gene deletions using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, and related genotype to response to therapy and long-term outcome. PTEN loss-of-function mutations/gene deletions were detected in 22% (PTEN(ABN)). Quantification of mutant level indicated that 67% of mutated cases harbored more than one mutant, with up to four mutants detected, consistent with the presence of multiple leukemic sub-clones. Overall, 41% of PTEN(ABN) cases were considered to have biallelic abnormalities (mutation and/or deletion) with complete loss of PTEN in a proportion of cells. In addition, 9% of cases had N- or K-RAS mutations. Neither PTEN nor RAS genotype significantly impacted on response to therapy or long-term outcome, irrespective of mutant level, and there was no evidence that they changed the highly favorable outcome of patients with double NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations. These results indicate that, for pediatric patients treated according to current protocols, routine screening for PTEN or RAS abnormalities at diagnosis is not warranted to further refine risk stratification. 
CYP2A6 is a major hepatic member of the cytochrome P450 family in humans. Much variation in CYP2A6 levels and activity can be attributed to genetic polymorphisms of this gene. CYP2A6*25 comprises an amino acid substitution, F118L. To clarify the effect of the leucine substitution at position 118 in CYP2A6.25, this variant, wild type CYP2A6 and three additional variants consisting of artificial mutations at the substrate binding site (position 481) suggested by earlier reports using random mutagenesis studies [CYP2A6.1, CYP2A6.25, CYP2A6.1(F118A), CYP2A6.1(A481G) and CYP2A6.25(A481G)], were co-expressed with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in E. coli. The hydroxylase activity of these variants toward 7-ethoxycoumarin, coumarin, flavone, α-naphthoflavone, flavanone and hydroxyflavanone were examined. All the mutants had lower activities for coumarin 7-hydroxylation than the wild type. All the mutants showed higher activities for flavone and α-naphthoflavone compared with CYP2A6.1. CYP2A6.1 had the highest flavanone 2'-hydroxylase activity, whereas CYP2A6.25 had the highest 6- and 4'-hydroxylase activities. CYP2A6.1(F118A), CYP2A6.1(A481G) and CYP2A6.25(A481G) had higher flavanone 3'-hydroxylase activities than CYP2A6.1 and CYP2A6.25. Furthermore, 4'-hydroxyflavanone was metabolized by CYP2A6.25. These results indicate that the CYP2A6.25 mutation confers new substrate specificity towards flavonoids.
PIP4K2A is a lipid kinase that phosphorylates PtdIns5P, generating PtdIns4,5P2. Recently, PIP4K2A was identified as a potential target in acute myeloid leukemia cells. The objective of the present study was to investigate the PIP4K2A expression in hematological malignancies and verify the effects of PIP4K2A silencing on proliferation and survival of leukemia cell lines. PIP4K2A was found to be a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein with reduced levels in leukemia cell lines compared to normal leukocytes. PIP4K2A mRNA levels were significantly reduced in bone marrow cells from acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) patients compared with healthy donors and in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ≥5% compared with <5% bone marrow blasts. Low PIP4K2A expression (lowest tertile versus 2 higher tertiles) negatively impacted overall survival of MDS patients by univariate analysis. PIP4K2A silencing did not modulate cell proliferation, clonogenicity and apoptosis of HEL and Namalwa leukemia cells. In summary, we characterized the expression of PIP4K2A in a cohort of patients with hematological malignancies and we found that PIP4K2A mRNA expression is downregulated in RAEB-1/RAEB-2 MDS and ALL cells, and PIP4K2A silencing does not modulate cell survival in HEL and Namalwa leukemia cells. 
GNE myopathy is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by mutations in the GNE gene, encoding the key enzyme in the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetyl mannosamine kinase. We studied 50 Bulgarian Roma patients homozygous for p.I618T, an ancient founder mutation in the kinase domain of the GNE gene, dating before the Gypsy exodus from North West India. The clinical features in the Bulgarian GNE group can be described with disease onset mostly in the third decade, but in individual cases, onset was as early as 10 years of age. The majority of patients had foot drop as the first symptom, but three patients developed hand weakness first. Muscle weakness was early and severe for the tibialis anterior, and minimal or late for quadriceps femoris, and respiratory muscles were only subclinically affected even in the advanced stages of the disease. During a 15-year follow-up period, 32 patients became non-ambulant. The average period between disease onset and loss of ambulation was 10.34 ± 4.31 years, ranging from 3 to 20 years. Our analysis of affected sib pairs suggested a possible role of genetic modifying factors, accounting for significant variation in disease severity. 
PHOSPHO1 is one of principal proteins involved in initiating bone matrix mineralisation. Recent studies have found that Phospho1 KO mice (Phospho1-R74X) display multiple skeletal abnormalities with spontaneous fractures, bowed long bones, osteomalacia and scoliosis. These analyses have however been limited to young mice and it remains unclear whether the role of PHOSPHO1 is conserved in the mature murine skeleton where bone turnover is limited. In this study, we have used ex-vivo computerised tomography to examine the effect of Phospho1 deletion on tibial bone architecture in mice at a range of ages (5, 7, 16 and 34 weeks of age) to establish whether its role is conserved during skeletal growth and maturation. Matrix mineralisation has also been reported to influence terminal osteoblast differentiation into osteocytes and we have also explored whether hypomineralised bones in Phospho1 KO mice exhibit modified osteocyte lacunar and vascular porosity. Our data reveal that Phospho1 deficiency generates age-related defects in trabecular architecture and compromised cortical microarchitecture with greater porosity accompanied by marked alterations in osteocyte shape, significant increases in osteocytic lacuna and vessel number. Our in vitro studies examining the behaviour of osteoblast derived from Phospho1 KO and wild-type mice reveal reduced levels of matrix mineralisation and modified osteocytogenic programming in cells deficient in PHOSPHO1. Together our data suggest that deficiency in PHOSPHO1 exerts modifications in bone architecture that are transient and depend upon age, yet produces consistent modification in lacunar and vascular porosity. It is possible that the inhibitory role of PHOSPHO1 on osteocyte differentiation leads to these age-related changes in bone architecture. It is also intriguing to note that this apparent acceleration in osteocyte differentiation evident in the hypomineralised bones of Phospho1 KO mice suggests an uncoupling of the interplay between osteocytogenesis and biomineralisation. Further studies are required to dissect the molecular processes underlying the regulatory influences exerted by PHOSPHO1 on the skeleton with ageing.
CYP2J2 epoxygenase is an extrahepatic, membrane bound cytochrome P450 (CYP) that is primarily found in the heart and mediates endogenous fatty acid metabolism. CYP2J2 interacts with membranes through an N-terminal anchor and various non-contiguous hydrophobic residues. The molecular details of the motifs that mediate membrane interactions are complex and not fully understood. To gain better insights of these complex protein-lipid interactions, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a highly mobile membrane mimetic (HMMM) model that enabled multiple independent spontaneous membrane binding events to be captured. Simulations revealed that CYP2J2 engages with the membrane at the F-G loop through hydrophobic residues Trp-235, Ille-236, and Phe-239. To explore the role of these residues, three F-G loop mutants were modeled from the truncated CYP2J2 construct (Δ34) which included Δ34-I236D, Δ34-F239H and Δ34-I236D/F239H. Using the HMMM coordinates of CYP2J2, the simulations were extended to a full POPC membrane which showed a significant decrease in the depth of insertion for each of the F-G loop mutants. The CYP2J2 F-G loop mutants were expressed in E. coli and were shown to be localized to the cytosolic fraction at a greater percentage relative to construct Δ34. Notably, the functional data demonstrated that the double mutant, Δ34-I236D/F239H, maintained native-like enzymatic activity. The membrane insertion characteristics were examined by monitoring CYP2J2 Trp-quenching fluorescence spectroscopy upon binding nanodiscs containing pyrene phospholipids. Relative to the Δ34 construct, the F-G loop mutants exhibited lower Trp quenching and membrane insertion. Taken together, the results suggest that the mutants exhibit a different membrane topology in agreement with the MD simulations and provide important evidence towards the involvement of key residues in the F-G loop of CYP2J2. 
GBA mutations are among the most common genetic risk factors for Parkinson disease (PD) worldwide. We aimed to identify genetic modifiers of the age at onset (AAO) in GBA-associated PD. The study included a genome-wide discovery phase, including a cohort of 79 patients with the GBA p.N370S mutation, and candidate validation and replication analyses of 8 SNPs in patients with mild (n = 113) and severe (n = 41) GBA mutations. Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix human SNP 6.0 array and TaqMan assays. In the genome-wide phase, none of the SNPs passed the genome-wide significance threshold. Eight SNPs were selected for further analysis from the top hits. In all GBA-associated PD patients (n = 153), the BIN1 rs13403026 minor allele was associated with an older AAO (12.4 ± 5.9 years later, p = 0.0001), compared to patients homozygous for the major allele. Furthermore, the AAO was 10.7 ± 6.8 years later in patients with mild GBA mutations, (p = 0.005, validation group), and 17.1 ± 2.5 years later in patients with severe GBA mutations (p = 0.01, replication). Our results suggest that alterations in the BIN1 locus, previously associated with Alzheimer disease, may modify the AAO of GBA-associated PD. More studies in other populations are required to examine the role of BIN1-related variants in GBA-associated PD.
ABO genotyping is commonly used in several situations, including blood transfusion, personal identification and disease detection. The present study developed a novel method for ABO genotyping, using loop‑mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). This method allows the simultaneous determination of six ABO genotypes under 40 min at a constant temperature of 62˚C. The genotypes of 101 blood samples were determined to be AA (n=6), AO (n=38), BB (n=12), BO (n=29), AB (n=8) and OO (n=8) by the LAMP assay. The results were compared with the phenotypes determined by serological assay and the genotypes determined by direct sequencing, and no discrepancies were observed. This novel and rapid method, with good accuracy and reasonably cost effective, provides a supplement to routine serological ABO typing and may also be useful in other point‑of‑care testing.
ABO blood groups are known to influence the plasma level of von Willebrand factor (VWF), but little is known about the relationship between ABO and coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). We analyzed the influence of ABO genotypes on VWF antigen, FVIII activity, and their quantitative relationship in 11,673 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. VWF, FVIII, and FVIII/VWF levels varied significantly among O, A (A1 and A2), B and AB subjects, and the extent of which varied between Americans of European (EA) and African (AA) descent. We validated a strong influence of ABO blood type on VWF levels (15.2%), but also detected a direct ABO influence on FVIII activity (0.6%) and FVIII/VWF ratio (3.8%) after adjustment for VWF. We determined that FVIII activity changed 0.54% for every 1% change in VWF antigen level. This VWF-FVIII relationship differed between subjects with O and B blood types in EA, AA, and in male, but not female subjects. Variations in FVIII activity were primarily detected at low VWF levels. These new quantitative influences on VWF, FVIII and the FVIII/VWF ratio help understand how ABO genotypes differentially influence VWF, FVIII and their ratio, particularly in racial and gender specific manners. 
ABCG2 is an efflux drug transporter that plays an important role in drug resistance and drug disposition. In this study, the first three-dimensional structure of human full-length ABCG2 analysed by electron crystallography from two-dimensional crystals in the absence of nucleotides and transported substrates is reported at 2 nm resolution. In this state, ABCG2 forms a symmetric homodimer with a noncrystallographic twofold axis perpendicular to the two-dimensional crystal plane, as confirmed by subtomogram averaging. This configuration suggests an inward-facing configuration similar to murine ABCB1, with the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) widely separated from each other. In the three-dimensional map, densities representing the long cytoplasmic extensions from the transmembrane domains that connect the NBDs are clearly visible. The structural data have allowed the atomic model of ABCG2 to be refined, in which the two arms of the V-shaped ABCG2 homodimeric complex are in a more closed and narrower conformation. The structural data and the refined model of ABCG2 are compatible with the biochemical analysis of the previously published mutagenesis studies, providing novel insight into the structure and function of the transporter.
PTEN deletion, mutation or reduced expression occurs in 63% of metastatic prostate tumors, resulting in the activation of PI3K and its downstream targets, AKT and mTOR. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway results in upregulation of the MAPK pathway. Therefore, co-administration of inhibitors of both pathways, GSK2126458 as a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, and AZD6244 as a MEK inhibitor, is able to overcome resistance and increase anti-tumor efficacy.
LPL is the rate-limiting enzyme for uptake of TG-derived FFA in peripheral tissues, and the enzyme is expressed in the brain and CNS. We previously created a mouse which lacks neuronal LPL. This animal becomes obese on a standard chow, and we observed reduced lipid uptake in the hypothalamus at 3 months preceding obesity. In our present study, we replicated the animal phenotype in an immortalized mouse hypothalamic cell line (N41) to examine how LPL affects expression of AgRP as well as entry and storage of lipids into neurons. We show that LPL is able to modulate levels of the orexigenic peptide AgRP. LPL also exerts effects on lipid uptake into culture neurons, and that uptake of neutral lipid can be enhanced even by mutant LPL lacking catalytic activity. N41 cells also accumulate neutral lipid in droplets, and this is at least in part regulated by LPL. These data in addition to those published in mice with neuron-specific deletion of LPL suggest that neuronal LPL is an important regulator of lipid homeostasis in neurons and that alterations in LPL levels may have important effects on systemic metabolism and neuronal lipid biology. 
ABO blood group has been associated with risk of cancers of the pancreas, stomach, ovary, kidney, and skin, but has not been evaluated in relation to risk of aggressive prostate cancer.
PIK3CA is the only frequently-mutated, directly druggable oncogene in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, it is unclear if a molecularly-driven intervention trial can be launched successfully, particularly within a single-institution setting secondary to the infrastructure necessary for mutation detection, mutation prevalence, and patient willingness to participate. This study aimed to evaluate 1) local frequency of PIK3CA activating mutations in HNSCC, 2) timeliness of our mutation-profiling clinical pathway, and 3) patients' willingness to enroll in a novel neoadjuvant drug trial. Tissue biopsies of 25 consecutive cases of HNSCC were tested for activating PIK3CA mutations at three mutational hotspots by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Mutations prevalence and number of working days accrued in determining PIK3CA mutational status were calculated. In addition, 30 HNSCC patients were surveyed prospectively regarding their willingness to participate in a hypothetical drug trial. Survey data were summarized descriptively. 4 of 25 (16 %) tumors harbored a PIK3CA activating mutation, including one at codon E542K, two at codon E545K/D, and one at codon H1047R. On average, this result was obtained in approximately 15 working days (range, 9-24 working days). The majority of patients surveyed (70 %) indicated their willingness to participate in a targeted PIK3CA trial. This study provides evidence that within a single institution, PIK3CA activating mutations can be detected with expected frequency, with sufficient timeliness and sufficient patient interest to mount a targeted intervention trial that may lead to improved tumor response in selected HNSCC patients. 
ABO blood type has previously been identified as a risk factor for thrombosis and pancreatic cancer (PC). The aim of the study is to demonstrate the associations between ABO blood type and other clinical factors with the risk of thromboembolism (TE) in patients with PC. We conducted a retrospective study in 670 patients with pathologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Clinical information was retrieved from medical records. ABO blood type was determined serologically and/or genetically. Logistic regression models, Kaplan-Meier plot, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazard regression models were employed in data analysis. The incidence of TE was 35.2% in 670 patients who did not have TE prior to cancer diagnosis. Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) consisted 44.1% of the TE events. Non-O blood type, pancreatic body/tail tumors, previous use of antithrombotic medication, and obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m(2) ) were significant predictors for TE in general. Blood type A and AB, low hemoglobin level (≤ 10 g/dL), obesity, metastatic tumor, and pancreatic body/tail tumors were significant predictors for PE and DVT. Patients with metastatic tumor or pancreatic body/tail tumors had a much higher frequency of early TE events (≤ 3 months after cancer diagnosis); and early TE occurrence was a significant independent predictor for increased risk of death. These observations suggest that ABO non-O blood type is an independent predictor for TE in PC. A better understanding of the risk factors for TE in PC may help to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation therapy.
PTEN is an important tumor suppressor gene that antagonizes the oncogenic PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and has functions in the nucleus for maintaining genome integrity. Although PTEN inactivation by mutation is infrequent in breast cancer, transcript and protein levels are deficient in >25 % of cases. The E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 (also known as NEDD4-1) has been reported to negatively regulate PTEN protein levels through poly-ubiquitination and proteolysis in carcinomas of the prostate, lung, and bladder, but its effect on PTEN in the breast has not been studied extensively. To investigate whether NEDD4 contributes to low PTEN levels in human breast cancer, we analyzed the expression of these proteins by immunohistochemistry across a large Swedish cohort of breast tumor specimens, and their transcript expression levels by microarrays. For both NEDD4 and PTEN, their transcript expression was significantly correlated to their protein expression. However, comparing NEDD4 expression to PTEN expression, either no association or a positive correlation was observed at the protein and transcript levels. This unexpected observation was further corroborated in two independent breast cancer cohorts from The Netherlands Cancer Institute and The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our results suggest that NEDD4 is not responsible for the frequent down-regulation of the PTEN protein in human breast carcinoma. 
PTEN is one of the most frequently mutated tumour suppressors and reduction in PTEN protein stability also plays a role in tumorigenesis. Although several ubiquitin ligases for PTEN have been identified, the deubiquitylase for de-polyubiquitylation and stabilization of PTEN is less defined. Here, we report OTUD3 as a deubiquitylase of PTEN. OTUD3 interacts with, de-polyubiquitylates and stabilizes PTEN. Depletion of OTUD3 leads to the activation of Akt signalling, induction of cellular transformation and cancer metastasis. OTUD3 transgenic mice exhibit higher levels of the PTEN protein and are less prone to tumorigenesis. Reduction of OTUD3 expression, concomitant with decreased PTEN abundance, correlates with human breast cancer progression. Furthermore, we identified loss-of-function OTUD3 mutations in human cancers, which either abolish OTUD3 catalytic activity or attenuate the interaction with PTEN. These findings demonstrate that OTUD3 is an essential regulator of PTEN and that the OTUD3-PTEN signalling axis plays a critical role in tumour suppression. 
ASH1L (absent, small, or homeotic-like 1) is a histone methyltransferase (HMTase) involved in gene activation that is overexpressed in multiple forms of cancer. Previous studies of ASH1L's catalytic SET domain identified an autoinhibitory loop that blocks access of histone substrate to the enzyme active site. Here, we used both nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography to identify conformational dynamics in the ASH1L autoinhibitory loop. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we found that point mutations in the autoinhibitory loop that perturb the structure of the SET domain result in decreased enzyme activity, indicating that the autoinhibitory loop is not a simple gate to the active site but is rather a key feature critical to ASH1L function. We also identified a second loop in the SET-I subdomain of ASH1L that experiences conformational dynamics, and we trapped two different conformations of this loop using crystallographic studies. Mutation of the SET-I loop led to a large decrease in ASH1L enzymatic activity in addition to a significant conformational change in the SET-I loop, demonstrating the importance of the structure and dynamics of the SET-I loop to ASH1L function. Furthermore, we found that three C-terminal chromatin-interacting domains greatly enhance ASH1L enzymatic activity and that ASH1L requires native nucleosome substrate for robust activity. Our study illuminates the role of concerted conformational dynamics in ASH1L function and identifies structural features important for ASH1L enzymatic activity. 
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates the PTEN/PI3k/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is frequently altered in human cancers including gallbladder cancer (GBC). To determine the frequency of PTEN expression in GBC and to establish its relation to clinical and morphological parameters and survival in GBC.
ABCG2 is an ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter with a physiological role in urate transport in the kidney and is also implicated in multi-drug efflux from a number of organs in the body. The trafficking of the protein and the mechanism by which it recognizes and transports diverse drugs are important areas of research. In the current study, we have made a series of single amino acid mutations in ABCG2 on the basis of sequence analysis. Mutant isoforms were characterized for cell surface expression and function. One mutant (I573A) showed disrupted glycosylation and reduced trafficking kinetics. In contrast with many ABC transporter folding mutations which appear to be 'rescued' by chemical chaperones or low temperature incubation, the I573A mutation was not enriched at the cell surface by either treatment, with the majority of the protein being retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Two other mutations (P485A and M549A) showed distinct effects on transport of ABCG2 substrates reinforcing the role of TM helix 3 in drug recognition and transport and indicating the presence of intracellular coupling regions in ABCG2. 
WWOX is a >1 Mb gene spanning FRA16D Common Chromosomal Fragile Site, a region of DNA instability in cancer. Consequently, altered WWOX levels have been observed in a wide variety of cancers. In vitro studies have identified a large number and variety of potential roles for WWOX. Although its normal role in vivo and functional contribution to cancer have not been fully defined, WWOX does have an integral role in metabolism and can suppress tumor growth. Using Drosophila melanogaster as an in vivo model system, we find that WWOX is a modulator of TNFα/Egr-mediated cell death. We found that altered levels of WWOX can modify phenotypes generated by low level ectopic expression of TNFα/Egr and this corresponds to altered levels of Caspase 3 activity. These results demonstrate an in vivo role for WWOX in promoting cell death. This form of cell death is accompanied by an increase in levels of reactive oxygen species, the regulation of which we have previously shown can also be modified by altered WWOX activity. We now hypothesise that, through regulation of reactive oxygen species, WWOX constitutes a link between alterations in cellular metabolism observed in cancer cells and their ability to evade normal cell death pathways. We have further shown that WWOX activity is required for the efficient removal of tumorigenic cells from a developing epithelial tissue. Together these results provide a molecular basis for the tumor suppressor functions of WWOX and the better prognosis observed in cancer patients with higher levels of WWOX activity. Understanding the conserved cellular pathways to which WWOX contributes provides novel possibilities for the development of therapeutic approaches to restore WWOX function in cancer.
ABCA4 is a member of the A-subfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters localized in rod and cone outer segment disc membranes. Over 800 mutations in ABCA4 are now known to cause Stargardt macular degeneration and related retinal degenerative diseases. Biochemical studies have shown that ABCA4 transports or flips the 11-cis and all-trans isomers of N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine across disc membranes, thereby facilitating the removal of retinal from disc membranes through the visual cycle and preventing the accumulation of potentially toxic bisretinoid compounds in photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelial cells. This chapter summarizes studies which have led to our understanding of the role of ABCA4 in the visual cycle and Stargardt disease. 
GAMT deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of creatine biosynthesis causing developmental delays or intellectual disability in untreated patients as a result of irreversible brain damage occurring prior to diagnosis. Normal neurodevelopmental outcome has been reported in patients treated from neonatal period highlighting the importance of early treatment.
CD36 is a key transporter involved in fatty acid (FA) uptake and contributes to the accumulation of FA in cardiomyocytes. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of ouabain, a glycoside regulator of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, in the regulation of CD36 expression and FA accumulation. FATP1 transgenic (Tg) mice with lipotoxic cardiomyopathy displayed significantly increased cardiac CD36 expression and free fatty acid accumulation. The data on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that endogenous ouabain was decreased in the serum of Tg mice versus wild-type mice. CD36 expression and free fatty acid accumulation in their primary cardiomyocytes were abated by treatment with 0.15-0.30 μM ouabain. CD36 expression was suppressed by 0.2 μM ouabain treatment, and the suppression was rescued by C-reactive protein. CD36 expression and free fatty acid accumulation in the heart were markedly reduced in Tg mice injected with 30 or 40 ng of ouabain (P < 0.01). Obvious fatty infiltration was found in noninjected Tg mice but not in the mice injected with 40 ng of ouabain. In conclusion, low-dose exogenous ouabain increased Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity, suppressed C-reactive protein-mediated CD36 expression, and alleviated murine cardiac lipotoxicity in vitro and in vivo.
SLCO1B1 polymorphisms are relevant in statin pharmacokinetics. Aim of this study was to investigate the genetic variability and haplotype profile of SLCO1B1 polymorphisms in Roma and Hungarian populations. Genotypes of 470 Roma and 442 Hungarian subjects for c.388A > G, c.521T > C and c.1498-1331T > C polymorphisms were determined by PCR-RFLP assay. Using these SNPs eight different haplotypes could be differentiated.
ABO blood types are determined by antigen modifications on glycoproteins and glycolipids and associated with altered plasma levels of inflammatory and endothelial injury markers implicated in AKI pathogenesis. We sought to determine the association of ABO blood types with AKI risk in critically ill patients with trauma or sepsis.
ACE inhibitory and antioxidative peptides identified by LCMS/MS, from mixed milk (Bubalus bubalis and Bos taurus) tryptic whey protein hydrolysate, were compared with the in silico predictions. α la and ß lg sequences, both from Bubalus bubalis and Bos taurus, were used for in silico study. SWISS-PROT and BIOPEP protein libraries were accessed for prediction of peptide generation. Study observed gaps in the prediction versus actual results, which remain unaddressed in the literature. Many peptides obtained in vitro, were not reflected in in silico predictions. Differences in identified peptides in separate libraries were observed too. In in silico prediction, peptides with known biological activities were also not reflected. Predictions, towards generation of bioactive peptides, based upon in silico release of proteins and amino acid sequences from different sources and thereupon validation in relation to actual results has often been reported in research literature. Given that computer aided simulation for prediction purposes is an effective research direction, regular updating of protein libraries and an effectual integration, for more precise results, is critical. The gaps addressed between these two techniques of research, have not found any address in literature. Inclusion of more flexibility with the variables, within the tools being used for prediction, and a hierarchy based database with search options for various peptides, will further enhance the scope and strength of research. 
PIK3CA is an oncogene that encodes the p110α component of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K); it is the second most frequently mutated gene following the TP53 gene. In the clinical setting, PIK3CA mutations may have favorable prognostic value for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients and, during the past few years, PIK3CA mutations of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) have attracted attention as a potential noninvasive biomarker of cancer. However, there are few reports on the clinical implications of PIK3CA mutations for TNBC patients. We investigated the PIK3CA major mutation status of cfDNA as a noninvasive biomarker of cancer using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), which has high level sensitivity and specificity for cancer mutation, in early-stage 49 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. A total of 12 (24.4%) of 49 patients had PIK3CA mutations of cfDNA. In a median follow up of 54.4 months, the presence of PIK3CA mutations of cfDNA had significant impacts on relapse-free survival (RFS; P = 0.0072) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS; P = 0.016), according to the log-lank test. In a Cox proportional hazards model, the presence of PIK3CA mutations of cfDNA had significant prognostic value in the univariate and multivariate analysis. Additionally, the presence of PIK3CA mutations of cfDNA was significantly correlated with positive androgen receptor phosphorylated form depending on PI3K signaling pathway (pAR) which is independent favorable prognostic factors of TNBC. We demonstrated that the presence of PIK3CA major mutations of cfDNA could be a discriminatory predictor of RFS and BCSS in early-stage TNBC patients and it was associated with PI3K pathway-dependent AR phosphorylation. 
CYP4B1 belongs to the cytochrome P450 family 4, one of the oldest P450 families whose members have been highly conserved throughout evolution. The CYP4 monooxygenases typically oxidize fatty acids to both inactive and active lipid mediators, although the endogenous ligand(s) is largely unknown. During evolution, at the transition of great apes to humanoids, the CYP4B1 protein acquired a serine instead of a proline at the canonical position 427 in the meander region. Although this alteration impairs P450 function related to the processing of naturally occurring lung toxins, a study in transgenic mice suggested that an additional serine insertion at position 207 in human CYP4B1 can rescue the enzyme stability and activity. Here, we report that the genomic insertion of a CAG triplet at the intron 5-exon 6 boundary in human CYP4B1 introduced an additional splice acceptor site in frame. During evolution, this change occurred presumably at the stage of Hominoidae and leads to two major isoforms of the CYP4B1 enzymes of humans and great apes, either with or without a serine 207 insertion (insSer207). We further demonstrated that the CYP4B1 enzyme with insSer207 is the dominant isoform (76%) in humans. Importantly, this amino acid insertion did not affect the 4-ipomeanol metabolizing activities or stabilities of the native rabbit or human CYP4B1 enzymes, when introduced as transgenes in human primary cells and cell lines. In our 3D modeling, this functional neutrality of insSer207 is compatible with its predicted location on the exterior surface of CYP4B1 in a flexible side chain. Therefore, the Ser207 insertion does not rescue the P450 functional activity of human CYP4B1 that has been lost during evolution. 
UCP2 plays a physiological role by regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, maintaining energy balance, ROS elimination, and regulating cellular autophagy in numerous tissues. But the exact roles of UCP2 in cumulus cells are still not clear. Genipin, a special UCP2 inhibitor, was added into the cultural medium to explore the roles of UCP2 in human cumulus cells. There were no significant differences in ATP and mitochondrial membrane potential levels in cumulus cells from UCP2 inhibiting groups as compared with the control. The levels of ROS and Mn-SOD were markedly elevated after UCP2 inhibited Genipin. However, the ratio of reduced GSH to GSSG significantly declined after treatment with Genipin. UCP2 inhibition by Genipin also resulted in obvious increase in the active caspase-3, which accompanied the decline of caspase-3 mRNA. The level of progesterone in culture medium declined obviously after Genipin treatment. But there was no significant difference in estradiol concentrations. This study indicated that UCP2 is expressed in human cumulus cells and plays important roles on mediate ROS production, apoptotic process, and steroidogenesis, suggesting UCP2 may be involved in regulation of follicle development and oocyte maturation and quality. 
ABO incompatibility is no longer considered a contraindication for adult living donor liver transplantation (ALDLT) due to various strategies to overcome the ABO blood group barrier. We report the largest single-center experience of ABO-incompatible (ABOi) ALDLT in 235 adult patients. The desensitization protocol included a single dose of rituximab and total plasma exchange. In addition, local graft infusion therapy, cyclophosphamide, or splenectomy was used for a certain time period, but these treatments were eventually discontinued due to adverse events. There were three cases (1.3%) of in-hospital mortality. The cumulative 3-year graft and patient survival rates were 89.2% and 92.3%, respectively, and were comparable to those of the ABO-compatible group (n = 1301). Despite promising survival outcomes, 17 patients (7.2%) experienced antibody-mediated rejection that manifested as diffuse intrahepatic biliary stricture; six cases required retransplantation, and three patients died. ABOi ALDLT is a feasible method for expanding a living liver donor pool, but the efficacy of the desensitization protocol in targeting B cell immunity should be optimized. 
ACE inhibitors and ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers) have been shown to attenuate radiation injuries in animal models of lethal gamma irradiation. These two classes of drug act by curtailing the actions of angiotensin II-linked inflammatory pathways that are up-regulated during gamma radiation in organ systems such as the brain, lung, kidney, and bone marrow. ACE inhibitors inhibit ACE and attenuate the formation of angiotensin II from angiotensin I; ARBs block the angiotensin AT1 receptor and attenuate the actions of angiotensin II that are elicited through the receptor. DAA-I (des-aspartate-angiotensin I), an orally active angiotensin peptide, also attenuates the deleterious actions of angiotensin II. It acts as an agonist on the angiotensin AT1 receptor and elicits responses that oppose those of angiotensn II. Thus, DAA-I was investigated for its anticipated radioprotection in gamma irradiated mice. DAA-I administered orally at 800 nmole/kg/day for 30 days post exposure (6.4 Gy) attenuated the death of mice during the 30-day period. The attenuation was blocked by losartan (50 nmole/kg/day, i.p.) that was administered sequential to DAA-I administration. This shows that the radioprotection was mediated via the angiotensin AT1 receptor. Furthermore, the radioprotection correlated to an increase in circulating PGE2 of surviving animals, and this suggests that PGE2 is involved in the radioprotection in DAA-I-treated mice. At the hematopoietic level, DAA-I significantly improved two syndromes of myelosuppression (leucopenia and lymphocytopenia), and mice pre-treated with DAA-I prior to gamma irradiation showed significant improvement in the four myelodysplastic syndromes that were investigated, namely leucopenia, lymphocytopenia, monocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. Based on the known ability of PGE2 to attenuate the loss of functional hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in radiation injury, we hypothesize that PGE2 mediated the action of DAA-I. DAA-I completely attenuated the increase in circulating level of two inflammatory cytokines, TNFα and IL-6, in irradiated mice; and this shows that DAA-I exerted additional anti-inflammatory actions, which could also have contributed to its radioprotection. These findings show that DAA-I acts via a novel mechanism of action on the angiotensin AT1 receptor to specifically release PGE2, which mediates radioprotection in the gamma irradiated mice.
PTEN gene loss occurs frequently in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and may drive progression through activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Here, we developed a novel CTC-based assay to determine PTEN status and examined the correlation between PTEN status in CTCs and matched tumour tissue samples.
CFTR is unique among ABC transporters as the only one functioning as an ion channel and from a human health perspective because mutations in its gene cause cystic fibrosis. Although considerable advances have been made towards understanding CFTR's mechanism of action and the impact of mutations, the lack of a high-resolution 3D structure has hindered progress. The large multi-domain membrane glycoprotein is normally present at low copy number and when over expressed at high levels it aggregates strongly, limiting the production of stable mono-disperse preparations. While the reasons for the strong self-association are not fully understood, its relatively low thermal stability seems likely to be one. The major CF causing mutation, ΔF508, renders the protein very thermally unstable and therefore a great deal of attention has been paid to this property of CFTR. Multiple second site mutations of CFTR in NBD1 where F508 normally resides and small molecule binders of the domain increase the thermal stability of the mutant. These manipulations also stabilize the wild-type protein. Here we have applied ΔF508-stabilizing changes and other modifications to generate wild-type constructs that express at much higher levels in scaled-up suspension cultures of mammalian cells. After purification and reconstitution into liposomes these proteins are active in a locked-open conformation at temperatures as high as 50 °C and remain monodisperse at 4 °C in detergent or lipid for at least a week. The availability of adequate amounts of these and related stable active preparations of homogeneous CFTR will enable stalled structural and ligand binding studies to proceed.
ABO blood type incompatibility between a donor and recipient is generally considered a contraindication to kidney transplantation.
CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms modulate inter-individual variations in the human body's responses to various endogenous and exogenous drug substrates. To date, little is known about the CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms among the aboriginal populations of the world, including those in Malaysia.
GSTM1 and GSTT1 are phase II enzymes which provide chemical defense to cells.
DGAT2 (acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase, EC2.3.1.20) is a member of acyl-CoA: monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) family, which catalyzes one fatty acyl-CoA and diacylglycerol (DG) molecule to form triacylglycerols (TG) and is the final and rate-limiting step in the reaction of TG synthesis pathways. We previously showed that, during pig development, the fold change of DGAT2 mRNA in backfat tissue is much higher than that of DGAT1, implying that DGAT2 is more important in regulating porcine fat deposition. In this study, a 13 bp indel polymorphism located at 905 bp downstream from the stop codon (TGA) of porcine DGAT2 was found and two alleles of A (with 13 bp insertion) and B (no insertion) were designated. Allele A is dominant in all pig populations investigated. The backfat thickness of individuals with genotype AA is significantly lower than those with genotype AB (p<0.01), and the lean percentage of individuals with genotype AA is significantly higher than those with genotype AB (p<0.05) in Junmu No. 1 white pig population. The secondary structure of 3'-UTR without the 13 bp insertion is slightly less stable than with the 13 bp insertion type. In vitro assay indicates that, after differentiation, the luciferase activity was significantly higher for pGL3-B compared to pGL3-A vector (p<0.001). Moreover, the DGAT2 mRNA expression in the backfat tissue of pigs with genotype BB was significantly higher than AB in commercial DLY pigs (p<0.05). These results suggest that the 13bp indel polymorphism in the 3'-UTR of porcine DGAT2 most likely affects fat deposition by altering its expression in pigs.
SUCLA2 encodes for a subunit of succinyl-coenzyme A synthase, the enzyme that reversibly synthesises succinyl-coenzyme A and ATP from succinate, coenzyme A and ADP in the Krebs cycle. Disruption of SUCLA2 function can lead to mitochondrial DNA depletion. Patients with a SUCLA2 mutation present with a rare but distinctive deafness-dystonia syndrome. Additionally, they exhibit elevated levels of the characteristic biochemical markers: methylmalonate, C4-dicarboxylic carnitine and lactate are increased in both plasma and urine. Thus far, eight different disease-causing SUCLA2 mutations, of which six missense mutations and two splice site mutations, have been described in the literature. Here, we present the first patient with an intragenic deletion in SUCLA2 and review the patients described in literature. 
PTEN is a dual-specificity protein tyrosine phosphatase. As one of the central tumor suppressors, a thorough regulation of its activity is essential for proper cellular homeostasis. The precise implications of PTEN inhibition by reactive oxygen species (e.g. H2 O2 ) and the subsequent structural consequences remain elusive. To study the effects of PTEN inhibition, bisperoxidovanadium (bpV) complexes serve as important tools with the potential for the treatment of nerve injury or cardiac ischemia. However, their mode of action is unknown, hampering further optimization and preventing therapeutic applications. Based on protein crystallography, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy, we elucidate the molecular basis of PTEN inhibition by H2O2 and bpV complexes. We show that both molecules inhibit PTEN via oxidative mechanisms resulting in the formation of the same intramolecular disulfide, therefore enabling the reactivation of PTEN under reductive conditions.
ABO blood type is an established prognostic factor in several malignancies, but its role in esophageal cancer (EC) is largely unknown. The aim of this study is to determine whether ABO blood group is associated with survival after esophagectomy for EC.
GBA has been identified as a genetic risk factor for PD. Whether the clinical manifestations of PD patients with or without GBA mutations are different has still not reached a consensus. We firstly detected the GBA mutation L444P in 1147 Chinese PD patients and simultaneously evaluated their corresponding clinical data. Then we compared the phenotypes between 646 PD patients with GBA mutations and 10344 PD patients without GBA mutations worldwide through meta-analysis. Through the method of meta-analysis, there was significant difference in age at onset (MD = -3.10 [95% CI: -4.88, -1.32]), bradykinesia as an initial symptom (OR = 1.49 [95% CI: 1.15, 1.94]), having family history (OR = 1.50 [95% CI: 1.18, 1.91]), and dementia (OR = 3.21 [95% CI: 1.97, 5.24]) during the comparison between PD patients with and without GBA mutations. While, in the aspect of tremor as an initial symptom (OR = 0.81 [95% CI: 0.64, 1.03]), the severity of motor symptoms such as H-Y (MD = 0.06 [95% CI: -0.06, 0.17]) and UPDRS-III (MD = 1.61 [95% CI: -0.65, 3.87]) and having dyskinesia (OR = 1.60 [95% CI: 0.90, 2.84]) during the comparison between the two groups revealed no statistical differences. Our results suggested that the phenotypes of PD patients with GBA mutations are different from GBA noncarriers. 
ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn occurs almost exclusively in infants of blood group A and B who are born to group O mothers. Positive Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) can identify those infants who are at risk of developing the ABO hemolytic disease. Earlier studies have suggested that BO incompatibility is associated with a positive DAT in black infants. In this study we sought to determine whether ABO incompatibility type could be associated with a higher rate of DAT positivity or clinical hemolytic disease. We reviewed the electronic medical records of all ABO-incompatible births over a 2-year period. There were 1537 ABO-incompatible births during the study period. DAT was more commonly positive among BO incompatible (21.5% in BO vs. 14.8% in AO, P=0.001) and black (18.8% in blacks vs. 10.8% in nonblacks, P=0.003) infants. DAT positivity was significantly associated with both severe hyperbilirubinemia (P=0.028) and hemolytic anemia (P<0.001). BO incompatibility was significantly associated with hemolytic anemia, but not severe hyperbilirubinemia, in the infants tested. 
GUCY2D encodes retinal guanylate cylase-1 (retGC1), a protein that plays a pivotal role in the recovery phase of phototransduction. Mutations in GUCY2D are associated with a leading cause of recessive Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA1). Patients present within the first year of life with aberrant or unrecordable electroretinogram (ERG), nystagmus and a relatively normal fundus. Aside from abnormalities in the outer segments of foveal cones and, in some patients, foveal cone loss, LCA1 patients retain normal retinal laminar architecture suggesting they may be good candidates for gene replacement therapy. Several animal models of LCA1, both naturally occurring and engineered, have been characterized and provide valuable tools for translational studies. This mini-review will summarize the phenotypes of these models and describe how each has been instrumental in proof of concept studies to develop a gene replacement therapy for GUCY2D-LCA1. 
PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome (PHTS) is caused by heterozygous variants in PTEN and is characterised by tumour predisposition, macrocephaly, and cognition impairment. Bi-allelic loss of PTEN activity has not been reported so far and animal models suggest that bi-allelic loss of PTEN activity is embryonically lethal. Here, we report the identification of a novel homozygous variant in PTEN, NM_000314.4; c.545T>C; p.Leu182Ser, in two adolescent siblings with severe macrocephaly and mild intellectual disability. The variant is predicted to be damaging and is associated with significantly increased phospho-S6 downstream of PTEN. The absence of tumours in the two homozygous siblings as well as lack of symptoms of PHTS in the heterozygous carriers of the family suggest that this particular variant is functionally hypomorphic rather than deleterious.
ABO incompatibility is not a contraindication to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), but it has been associated with additional risks including delayed engraftment, pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), and higher transfusion needs. Data on these events and on patient survival after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) HCT are limited.
ABCG2 is one of three human ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters involved in the export from cells of a chemically and structurally diverse range of compounds. This multidrug efflux capability, together with a broad tissue distribution in the body, means that ABCG2 exerts a range of effects on normal physiology such as kidney urate transport, as well as contributing towards the pharmacokinetic profiles of many exogenous drugs. The primary sequence of ABCG2 contains only half the number of domains required for a functioning ABC transporter and so it must oligomerise in order to function, yet its oligomeric state in intact cell membranes remains uncharacterized. We have analysed ABCG2 in living cell membranes using a combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, photon counting histogram analysis, and stepwise photobleaching to demonstrate a predominantly tetrameric structure for ABCG2 in the presence or absence of transport substrates. These results provide the essential basis for exploring pharmacological manipulation of oligomeric state as a strategy to modulate ABCG2 activity in future selective therapeutics. 
SLC1A2 is reported to be responsible for the majority of glutamate uptake, which has a crucial role in neural development and synaptic plasticity, and a disturbance in glutamatergic transmission has been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SCZ) and cognition. To evaluate the relationship of common variants within SLC1A2 with SCZ and cognition in Han Chinese, 28 tag SNPs were genotyped in the discovery stage, which included 1117 cases and 2289 controls; significantly associated markers were genotyped in the replication stage with 2128 cases and 3865 controls. The rs4354668 SNP was identified to be significantly associated with SCZ in both datasets, and a similar pattern was also observed in the two-stage study on conducting imputation and haplotype association analyses. In addition, significant associations between the rs4354668 SNP and cognition were observed when processing the perseverative error of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test in patients and controls. Our results provide supportive evidence for an effect of SLC1A2 on the etiology of SCZ, suggesting that genetic variation (rs4354668 and its haplotypes) in SLC1A2 may be involved in impaired executive function, which adds to the current body of knowledge regarding the risk of SCZ and the impairment of cognitive performance.
ABCG2 (ATP binding cassette subfamily G, member 2) mediates resistance to a variety of cytotoxic agents. Although human ABCG2 is well characterized, the function of canine ABCG2 has not been studied previously. Feline ABCG2 has an amino acid substitution in the adenosine triphosphate-binding domain that decreases its transport capacity relative to human ABCG2. Our goal was to compare canine ABCG2-mediated chemotherapeutic drug resistance to feline ABCG2-mediated chemotherapeutic drug resistance. HEK-293 cells stably transfected with plasmid containing canine ABCG2, feline ABCG2 or no ABCG2 were exposed to carboplatin, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, toceranib or vincristine, and cell survival was subsequently determined. Canine ABCG2 conferred a greater degree of chemotherapy resistance than feline ABCG2 for mitoxantrone. Neither canine nor feline ABCG2 conferred resistance to doxorubicin, vincristine or toceranib. Canine, but not feline, ABCG2 conferred resistance to carboplatin, a drug that is not reported to be a substrate for ABCG2 in other species.
SETDB1 is a histone H3K9 methyltransferase that has a critical role in early development. It is located within a melanoma susceptibility locus and facilitates melanoma formation. However, the mechanism by which SETDB1 regulates tumorigenesis remains unknown. Here we report the molecular interplay between SETDB1 and the well-known hotspot gain-of-function (GOF) TP53 R249S mutation. We show that in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) SETDB1 is overexpressed with moderate copy number gain, and GOF TP53 mutations including R249S associate with this overexpression. Inactivation of SETDB1 in HCC cell lines bearing the R249S mutation suppresses cell growth. The TP53 mutation status renders cancer cells dependent on SETDB1. Moreover, SETDB1 forms a complex with p53 and catalyses p53K370 di-methylation. SETDB1 attenuation reduces the p53K370me2 level, which subsequently leads to increased recognition and degradation of p53 by MDM2. Together, we provide both genetic and biochemical evidence for a mechanism by which SETDB1 regulates cancer cell growth via methylation of p53. 
SRM (selected reaction monitoring), a tandem mass spectrometry-based method characterized by high repeatability and accuracy, is an effective tool for the quantification of predetermined proteins. In this study, we built a time-scheduled dimethyl-SRM method that can provide the precise relative quantification of 92 proteins in one run. By applying this method to the Salmonella PhoP/PhoQ two-component system, we found that the expression of selected PhoP/PhoQ-activated proteins in response to Mg(2+) concentrations could be divided into two distinct patterns. For the time-course SRM experiment, we found that the dynamics of the selected PhoP/PhoQ-activated proteins could be divided into three distinct patterns, providing a new clue regarding PhoP/PhoQ activation and regulation. Moreover, the results for iron homeostasis proteins in response to Mg(2+) concentrations revealed that the PhoP/PhoQ two-component system may serve as a repressor for iron uptake proteins. And ribosomal protein levels clearly showed a response to different Mg(2+) concentrations and to time. 
ACAD9 (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9) is an essential factor for the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I assembly. ACAD9, a member of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family, has high homology with VLCAD (very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) and harbors a homodimer structure. Recently, patients with ACAD9 deficiency have been described with a wide clinical spectrum ranging from severe lethal form to moderate form with exercise intolerance.We report here a prenatal presentation with intrauterine growth retardation and cardiomegaly, with a fatal outcome shortly after birth. Compound heterozygous mutations, a splice-site mutation - c.1030-1G>T and a missense mutation - c.1249C>T; p.Arg417Cys, were identified in the ACAD9 gene. Their effect on protein structure and expression level was investigated. Protein modeling suggested a functional effect of the c.1030-1G>T mutation generating a non-degraded truncated protein and the p.Arg417Cys, creating an aberrant dimer. Our results underscore the crucial role of ACAD9 protein for cardiac function.
CYP3A4 is recognized as the main enzyme involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics in the human body and its inhibition may lead to undesirable consequences. Stilbenes, including resveratrol, belong to a group of dietary health-promoting compounds that also act as inhibitors of CYP3A4. The aim of this study was to examine the use of computer modeling of enzyme-ligand interactions to analyze and predict the inhibition of structurally related compounds. To this end, an aldehyde group was attached to resveratrol and the interactions of CYP3A4 with resveratrol, its aldehyde analogue (RA) and a known synthetic inhibitor were studied and compared in two biological models. Specifically, the metabolism of testosterone was examined in a human intestine cell line (Caco-2/TC7) and in rat liver microsomes (RLM). The results demonstrated a weak inhibitory effect of RA on CYP3A4, as compared to resveratrol itself, in both biological models. Human CYP3A4 was more susceptible to inhibition than the commonly used model isozyme from rat. Modeling of the binding site of CYP3A4 revealed a combination of three types of interactions: hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds. A docking simulation revealed that the RA lacked an important binding feature, as compared to resveratrol, and that that difference may be responsible for its lower level of affinity for CYP3A4. Software analysis of binding affinity may serve as a predictive tool for designing new therapeutic compounds in terms of inhibition of CYP3A4 and help to reveal the biochemical nature of the interactions of dietary compounds, herbal compounds and drugs whose metabolism is mediated by this enzyme. 
PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, of which Cowden syndrome (CS) is the most recognized variant, is characterized by multiple benign and malignant tumors of ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal origins, secondary to germline mutation in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a locally aggressive malignant fibroblastic/myofibroblastic tumor of the skin, characterized by the t(17:22)(q22:q13) translocation resulting in fusion of the COL1A1 and PDGFB genes. An association between CS and DFSP has not been reported in the literature to date. The authors have encountered a male patient with CS and a history of DFSP that developed adjacent to a sclerotic fibroma on the parietal scalp, both excised at age 7. He presented at age 21 with an enlarging pink nodule at the same site on the parietal scalp. Excision revealed a dermal and subcutaneous storiform spindle cell proliferation with fat entrapment and positive staining for CD34, consistent with DFSP. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed PDGFB gene rearrangement. PTEN expression in the patient's recurrent DFSP was nearly absent when compared with that of sporadic DFSP. To our knowledge, this is the first report of DFSP in a patient with CS. Although the association is likely to be coincidental, the authors revisited the PTEN and the PDGF pathways to speculate any possible interplay of the 2 conditions on a molecular level. 
PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism is associated with fatty liver disease, alcoholic or non-alcoholic (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TM6SF2 rs58542926 is clearly associated with NAFLD, but it is not clearly associated with HCC. The relationship between TM6SF2 rs58542926 and HCC and the potential synergistic effect of TM6SF2 and PNPLA3 variants in modifying the risk of HCC are not known.
PIK3CA mutation is considered a good candidate for targeted therapies in cancers, especially biliary tract cancer (BTC). We evaluated the utility of cell free DNA (cfDNA) from serum by using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) as an alternative source for PIK3CA mutation analysis. To identify matching archival tumour specimens from serum samples of advanced BTC patients, mutation detection using ddPCR with Bio-Rad's PrimePCR mutation and wild type assays were performed for PIK3CA p.E542K, p.E545K, and p.H1047R. Thirty-eight patients with metastatic BTC were enrolled. Only one (BTC 29T) sample (n = 38) was positive for PIK3CA p.E542K and another (BTC 27T) for p.H1047R mutation; none was positive for PIK3CA p.E545K. Matched serum sample (BTC 29P) was positive for PIK3CA p.E542K with 28 mutant copies detected, corresponding to 48 copies/ml of serum and an allelic prevalence of 0.3%. Another matched serum sample (BTC 27P) was positive for PIK3CA p.H1047R with 10 mutant copies detected, i.e. 18 copies/ml and an allelic frequency of 0.2%. High correlation was noted in the PIK3CA mutation status between tumour gDNA and serum cfDNA. Low-level PIK3CA mutations were detectable in the serum indicating the utility of cfDNA as a DNA source to detect cancer-derived mutations in metastatic biliary cancers. 
ATP1B1 encodes the Na,K-ATPase β subunit, a key regulator of the Na+ and K+ electrochemical gradients across the plasma membrane and an essential regulator of cellular activity. We used several microarray datasets to test the prognostic efficacy of ATP1B1 expression in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). Within the primary cohort (n = 157), high ATP1B1 expression (ATP1B1(high)) was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) (P = 0.0068, P = 0.0039, respectively). Similar results were also obtained in the European Leukemia Net (ELN) Intermediate-I genetic category (OS: P = 0.0035, EFS: P = 0.0007). Multivariable analyses confirmed ATP1B1(high) is an independent predictor of shorter OS (P = 0.042) and EFS (P = 0.035). Analysis of another CN-AML cohort confirmed that ATP1B1(high) is associated with shorter OS (P = 0.0046, n = 162). In addition, up-regulation of oncogenes/onco-microRNAs such as MYCN, CCND2, CDK6, KIT and miR-155, among others, was associated with ATP1B1(high), which may be indicative of ATP1B1's leukemogenicity. Our results may improve risk stratification and indicate new therapeutic targets for CN-AML.
ABO blood type locus has been reported to have ethnic difference and to be a pivotal genetic determinant of cardiovascular risk, whereas few prospective data regarding the impact on cardiovascular outcomes are available in a large cohort of patients with angiography-proven coronary artery disease, especially from the Chinese population. The objective of this study was to assess the prognostic role of blood type in future cardiovascular events (CVEs) in Chinese Han patients undergoing coronary angiography.The population of this prospective cohort study consisted of 3823 eligible patients, and followed annually to capture all CVEs. Baseline characteristics and ABO blood type were obtained. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the risk of ABO blood type on CVEs.New CVEs occurred in 348 patients [263 (10.3%) non-O and 85 (7.8%) O] during a median period of 24.6 months follow-up. Significantly, non-O blood group was related to the presence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis and several risk factors including inflammatory markers. The log-rank test revealed that there was a significant difference between non-O and O blood groups in event-free survival analysis (P = 0.026). In particular, the Cox proportional hazards models revealed that non-O blood type was associated with increased CVEs risk [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.320 (1.033-1.685)], even after adjusting for potential confounders [adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) non-O: 1.289 (1.003-1.656); A: 1.083 (0.797-1.472); B: 1.481 (1.122-1.955); AB: 1.249 (0.852-1.831), respectively].Non-O blood type is associated with future CVEs in Chinese Han patients undergoing coronary angiography.
UCP1 and UCP3 are members of the uncoupling protein (UCP) subfamily and are localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Whereas UCP1's central role in non-shivering thermogenesis is acknowledged, the function and even tissue expression pattern of UCP3 are still under dispute. Because UCP3 properties regarding transport of protons are qualitatively identical to those of UCP1, its expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) alongside UCP1 requires justification. In this work, we tested whether any correlation exists between the expression of UCP1 and UCP3 in BAT by quantification of protein amounts in mouse tissues at physiological conditions, in cold-acclimated and UCP1 knockout mice. Quantification using recombinant UCP3 revealed that the UCP3 amount in BAT (0.51ng/(μg total tissue protein)) was nearly one order of magnitude higher than that in muscles and heart. Cold-acclimated mice showed an approximate three-fold increase in UCP3 abundance in BAT in comparison to mice in thermoneutral conditions. Surprisingly, we found a significant decrease of UCP3 in BAT of UCP1 knockout mice, whereas the protein amount in skeletal and heart muscles remained constant. UCP3 abundance decreased even more in cold-acclimated UCP1 knockout mice. Protein quantification in UCP3 knockout mice revealed no compensatory increase in UCP1 or UCP2 expression. Our results do not support the participation of UCP3 in thermogenesis in the absence of UCP1 in BAT, but clearly demonstrate the correlation in abundance between both proteins. The latter is important for understanding UCP3's function in BAT. 
CD36 is a broadly expressed transmembrane protein that engages multiple ligands, including polar lipids. This protein is thought to even contribute to the chemosensory detection of long-chain fatty acids in the oral cavity of rodents. In this study, we assessed whether animals consciously perceive a ligand of CD36, 1-(palmitoyl)-2-(5-keto-6-octanedioyl)phosphatidylcholine (KOdiA-PC), and if so, whether CD36 is involved in sensing the oxidised phospholipid species. We found that mice avoided or hesitated to ingest fluids containing KOdiA-PC, suggesting a conscious perception of the lipid in the animals. We assessed the involvement and role of CD36 in the KOdiA-PC perception by comparing the behavioural responses of wild-type and CD36-deficient mice to the test fluids, and provided evidence that the protein could play a role in sensing a lower level of the lipid. We also found that transection of the olfactory nerve of wild-type mice resulted in an inability to perceive KOdiA-PC, suggesting the significance of olfactory system in the lipid sensing. Our findings, coupled with the recent finding of CD36 expression in the mouse olfactory epithelium, led us to predict that the site of CD36 action in the KOdiA-PC sensing plausibly lies within the nasal cavity of the animal. 
LPIN1 is a Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphatase. Variation in chicken LPIN1 exon 6 and its flanking regions were identified and three indel variants in 6 breeds and their associations with performance traits were studied. Seven variants were detected from 6 breeds, which contained a synonymous tri-allelic variant (c.924A/T/C) and three indels. The exon 6 variants detected from chicken breeds were conserved among bird species. The indel variation frequency presented clear differences among breeds. Two coding indels (c.1014-1018del3 and c.1125-1138del12) were multiples of three nucleotides and maintained the open reading frames of LPIN1 proteins. However, they were predicted to result in the clear change of the RNA secondary structure of chicken LPIN1 exon 6 and LPIN1 protein conformation. The association analysis showed that c.871-15-22del6 variation had a significant effect on body weight at hatch (BW0) and 2 weeks (BW2); c. 1014-1018del3 variation had a significant effect on BW4, BW6, caecum length and gizzard weight (GW) traits; c.1125-1138del12 variation had a significant effect on BW12, shank length at 4 weeks (SL4), carcass weight, lactate dehydrogenase traits (LDH), glucose (GLU) and albumin (ALB) traits. The genotype combination for c.1014-1018del3 and c.1125-1138del12 also presented significant effects on SL4, SL8, GW, leg muscle weight, ALB, GLU and LDH. The study demonstrated that chicken LPIN1 has an important effect on body, carcass and organ weight, serum LDH, GLU and ALB level. 
CFTR dysfunction can be involved in CBAVD, pancreatitis or bronchiectasis.
AKR1B10 is an NADPH-dependent reductase that plays an important function in several physiological reactions such as the conversion of retinal to retinol, reduction of isoprenyl aldehydes, and biotransformation of procarcinogens and drugs. A growing body of evidence points to the important role of the enzyme in the development of several types of cancer (e.g., breast, hepatocellular), in which it is highly overexpressed. AKR1B10 is regarded as a therapeutic target for the treatment of these diseases, and potent and specific inhibitors may be promising therapeutic agents. Several inhibitors of AKR1B10 have been described, but the area of natural plant products has been investigated sparingly. In the present study almost 40 diverse phenolic compounds and alkaloids were examined for their ability to inhibit the recombinant AKR1B10 enzyme. The most potent inhibitors-apigenin, luteolin, and 7-hydroxyflavone-were further characterized in terms of IC50, selectivity, and mode of action. Molecular docking studies were also conducted, which identified putative binding residues important for the interaction. In addition, cellular studies demonstrated a significant inhibition of the AKR1B10-mediated reduction of daunorubicin in intact cells by these inhibitors without a considerable cytotoxic effect. Although these compounds are moderately potent and selective inhibitors of AKR1B10, they constitute a new structural type of AKR1B10 inhibitor and may serve as a template for the development of better inhibitors. 
PIK3R1 (phosphoinositide-3-kinase, regulatory subunit 1) gain-of-function has recently been described in patients with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, chronic CMV-/EBV-infections, lymphoproliferation, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Here we report a 15-year-old boy with treatment refractory CMV lymphadenitis, severe combined immunodeficiency, microcephaly and a severe developmental defect of Th17 cells. To avoid poor outcome, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed. Subsequently, whole exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous G-to-C mutation (chr5: 5:67,589,663: G>C) at the splice donor site of the PIK3R1 gene. Our data suggest that PIK3R1 gain-of-function leads to developmental defects in helper and regulatory T-cell subsets, the latter expanding the immunological features of PIK3R1 gain-of-function. T-cell subsets play a critical role in the regulation of immune response against infectious agents and of autoimmunity and thus may be particularly accountable for the clinical phenotype of affected patients. 
TSTA3 participates in enzyme metabolism and affects glycosylation processes, and abnormal glycosylation influences the malignant transformation of cells and tumor development. However, studies have not examined the molecular biological function of TSTA3 in breast cancer (BC). The expression of TSTA3 was examined in BC tissues and cell lines. Kaplan-Meier survival tests and Cox regression were used to analyze prognosis. TSTA3 depletion was used to analyze cell function. The upstream miRNAs of TSTA3 were predicted, and the downstream target gene was analyzed using a RT2 Profiler™ PCR array. Our results show that TSTA3 was highly expressed in BC tissues and cells and was correlated with poor survival. The expression of TSTA3 was correlated with the TNM status (P < 0.01) and served as an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.041). TSTA3-siRNA decreased cell invasion and proliferation in vitro. miR-125a-5p and miR-125b are upstream targets of TSTA3, and a PCR array revealed that TSTA3 affects the CXCR4-CXCL12 genes. The findings suggest that miR-125a-5p/miR-125b suppress the expression of TSTA3, which controls cell proliferation and invasion by regulating CXCR4 expression. In conclusion, a high expression of TSTA3 exerts a proto-oncogenic effect during carcinogenesis and serves as an independent molecular marker for BC patients. 
"CFTR mutations are grouped according to disease-causing mechanism. Several studies demonstrated that patients having at least one mutation of class IV/V, present with a milder phenotype, but little is known about their relative treatment burden. We compared treatment burden between patients with two class I, II, or III mutations and patients with at least one mutation of class IV/V in the 2010 database of the Belgian CF Registry. We calculated a ""Treatment Burden Index"" (TBI) by assigning long term therapies to categories low, medium and high intensity, for differential weighing in the total score. There were 779 patients with two known class I/II/III mutations and 94 patients with at least one class IV/V mutation. Compared to class I/II/III, class IV/V patients had a lower median number of clinic visits (4 vs. 5; P < 0.001), a lower risk of hospitalization (24.7% vs. 50.8%; P < 0.001) and intravenous antibiotic treatment (23.5% vs. 46.0%; P < 0.001) and a lower median TBI (6 vs. 9; P < 0.001). These differences remained significant when only class IV/V patients with pancreatic insufficiency (n = 31) were considered. This study clearly demonstrates the significantly lower treatment burden in patients with CF and at least one class IV/V mutation compared to patients with two class I/II/III mutations and contributes to providing better individual counseling at time of diagnosis."
GALNT4 belongs to a family of N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases, which catalyze the transfer of GalNAc to Serine or Threonine residues in the initial step of mucin-type O-linked protein glycosylation. This glycosylation type is the most complex post-translational modification of proteins, playing important roles during cellular differentiation and in pathological disorders. Most of the breast cancer subtypes are estrogen receptor positive, and hence, the estrogen pathway represents a key regulatory network. We investigated the expression of GalNAc-T4 in a panel of mammary epithelial cell lines and found its expression is associated with the estrogen status of the cells. FOXA1, a key transcription factor, functions to promote estrogen responsive gene expression by acting as a cofactor to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), but all the aspects of this regulatory mechanism are not fully explored. This study found that knockdown of GALNT4 expression in human breast cancer cells attenuated the protein expression of ERα, FOXA1, and Cyclin D1. Further, our immunoprecipitation assays depicted the possibility of FOXA1 to undergo O-GalNAc modifications with a decrease of GalNAc residues in the GALNT4 knockdown cells and also impairment in the FOXA1-ERα association. Rescuing GALNT4 expression could restore the interaction as well as the glycosylation of FOXA1. Together, these findings suggest a key role for GalNAc-T4 in the estrogen pathway through FOXA1 glycosylation. 
CYP3A5 and ABCB1 polymorphisms have been shown to influence tacrolimus blood concentrations and dose requirements, but the conclusion in the current reports were inconformity. Sirolimus are also metabolized by CYP3A subfamily and are substrates of the P-gp. The aim was to determine whether these polymorphisms affect tacrolimus (TAC) and sirolimus (SRL) trough concentrations and dose requirements after renal transplantation. 153 renal transplant recipients were enrolled into this study, 112 were treated with TAC-based regimen, Another 43 recipients received SRL-based regimen. The recipients' mean follow-up time was 20 mo (range 15-27 mo). All renal transplant recipients were all in a stable stage. The trough concentration and daily dose of TAC and SRL were gained from each recipient. All recipients were genotyped for CYP3A5 (6986A>G), CYP3A4 intron 6 (CYP3A4*22), CYP3A4*18, ABCB1 exon 26 (3435C>T), exon 12 (1236C>T) and 2677G>T/A SNPs by HRM analysis (high-resolution melting curve analysis). The TAC and SRL concentration/dose ratio (C/D) in recipients with CYP3A5 (*)3/(*)3 were significantly higher than that of those with (*)1 allele (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant correlation between adjusted TAC and SRL trough concentrations or dose requirements with CYP3A4 and ABCB1 SNPs genetic polymorphisms. In recipients with TAC-based or SRL-based therapy, the CYP3A5 genes (6986A>G) can influence the TAC and SRL pharmacokinetics in renal transplant recipients. 
GNE myopathy is a rare neuromuscular disease whose description is fairly recent. It predominantly affects the adult population and is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder. Although universal and ubiquitous, GNE myopathy prevails in the Jewish community of Persian origin, living in Iran, Israel or in the United States. This condition has also been reported in great number in populations of far-East Asia (Japan and neighboring countries) and, closer to France, in Bulgaria. GNE myopathy causes muscle weakness in the extremities (distal myopathy), affecting initially and predominantly foot flexor muscles. The generic term of GNE myopathy is now fully accepted and encompasses two previously described entities: the quadriceps sparing myopathy, (also referred to as the autosomal recessive form of inclusion body myopathy (hIBM) and the Nonaka type distal myopathy (or distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles DMRV). This myopathy is due to mutations in the GNE gene encoding a bifunctional enzyme, the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase. This enzyme plays a role at two levels in the metabolic pathway leading to the synthesis of sialic acid. Sialic acid, also known as N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or NANA), is a monosaccharide essential to other protein or lipid molecules requiring sugar residues on their surface in order to function efficiently. GNE myopathy is characterized by histological lesions (rimmed vacuoles) within muscle fibers. They are fairly typical in a suggestive context, but non-specific and inconsistent from one muscle to another. The diagnosis of GNE myopathy is essentially based on clinical clues, including muscle imaging, and is confirmed by genetic studies. If promising therapeutic trials are being developed to compensate for this recently unveiled metabolic defect, the treatment of this myopathy remains purely supportive to date. 
PTEN is a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in human cancers. PTEN inhibits the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT cascade, and nuclear PTEN guards the genome by multiple mechanisms. Here, we report that PTEN physically associates with the minichromosome maintenance complex component 2 (MCM2), which is essential for DNA replication. Specifically, PTEN dephosphorylates MCM2 at serine 41 (S41) and restricts replication fork progression under replicative stress. PTEN disruption results in unrestrained fork progression upon replication stalling, which is similar to the phenotype of cells expressing the phosphomimic MCM2 mutant S41D. Moreover, PTEN is necessary for prevention of chromosomal aberrations under replication stress. This study demonstrates that PTEN regulates DNA replication through MCM2 and loss of PTEN function leads to replication defects and genomic instability. We propose that PTEN plays a critical role in maintaining genetic stability through a replication-specific mechanism, and this is a crucial facet of PTEN tumor suppressor activity. 
 AMPD1 c.34C > T (rs17602729) polymorphism results in AMPD1 deficiency. We examined the association of AMPD1 deficiency and variability of hemodynamic response to regadenoson.
DGAT2 plays a critical role in hepatic triglyceride production, and data suggests that inhibition of DGAT2 could prove to be beneficial in treating a number of disease states. This article documents the discovery and optimization of a selective small molecule inhibitor of DGAT2 as well as pharmacological proof of biology in a mouse model of triglyceride production. 
PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) is the molecular diagnostic term describing patients with Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, and other clinical presentations with germline mutation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. PHTS confers increased risks for specific malignancies, most notably breast, thyroid, renal, and endometrial cancers. Benign tumors are common, affecting a variety of tissues, and can range from subtle skin papules requiring no treatment to devastating vascular anomalies. There is also a broad range of neurodevelopmental effects, with some patients having no challenges and others with severe autism spectrum disorder and mental retardation. While most cases are inherited in a family for generations, following an autosomal dominant pattern, at least 10% and perhaps as many as 44% of cases are due to a new (de novo) mutation. Clinical presentations can vary dramatically from patient to patient, even among those in the same family. Features of this condition that may assist in diagnosis prior to cancer development can be subtle and difficult to recognize. This chapter will help the reader identify which patients should be referred for genetics evaluation and how to manage patients diagnosed with this rare condition. 
INPP4B is considered to function as a putative tumor suppressor through its inhibitory function of Akt. In various malignant tumors, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the chromosomal region containing INPP4B and lower expression of INPP4B has been reported. The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency of the INPP4B LOH and its association with the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis in breast cancer of Japanese women.
PLA2G7 encodes Lp-PLA2 having role in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques by catalyzing its substrate, phosphatydilcholine (PC), to be pro-inflammatory substances. The increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) in Asian population has been related with this enzyme. 279(Val→Phe) variant was reported to have a protective role against CAD due to, in part, secretion defect or loss of enzymatic function. Therefore, We study folding kinetics and enzyme-substrate interaction in 279(Val→Phe) by using clinical and computational biology approach.
GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms have been studied in many populations to evaluate their association with prostate cancer risk with contrasting results. The current study was aimed to find out the association of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms with prostate cancer in Pakistani men. This case control study included pathologically confirmed prostate cancer patients and age matched male controls. Epidemiological data was collected by a standard questionnaire and presence or absence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene was observed by multiplex PCR using CYP1A1 as housekeeping gene. Prostate cancer was more prevalent in age of >60 years and most of the patients were at stage IV (70 %) and have undergone surgery. Family history of cancer, smoking, metastasis and surgery were found to be significant (P<0.05) risk factors in prostate cancer development. Gleason score 7 was most prevalent (40.5 %) in prostate cancer patients. Source of drinking water, residential area, occupation, eating habits and number of family members had no association (P>0.05) with prostate cancer risk. No significant association was found when comparing GSTM1 (OR=0.78) and GSTT1 (OR=0.89) gene deletions with prostate cancer risk. Smoking and TNM staging were also not associated with deletion of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes. Comparison of dual null deletion of both genes with prostate cancer also showed non-significant associations. Deletion of GSTM1 gene at stage IV prostate cancer patients was significantly higher compared with other stages of cancer while no significance was shown by GSTT1 gene deletion. GSTM1, GSTT1 and deletion of both GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes do not contribute towards increased risk of prostate cancer in Pakistani population. 
DOT1L is a unique histone methyltransferase that targets the histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) residue for mono-, di- and tri- methylation. Histone H3K79 mono- and di-methylation results in active gene transcription, while H3K79 tri-methylation is associated with gene repression. DOT1L has a critical role in regulating gene transcription, development, cell cycle progression, somatic reprogramming and DNA damage repair. DOT1L interacts with Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) fusion proteins, leading to enhanced H3K79 methylation, maintenance of open chromatin, overexpression of downstream oncogenes and leukemogenesis. Importantly, small molecule DOT1L inhibitors have been recently developed, and one of the DOT1L inhibitors is already under investigation in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with MLL fusion gene-driven leukemia. 
CYP2C19 contributes to the metabolism of several chemotherapeutic agents. The CYP2C19 homozygous null function genotype strongly predicts activity phenotype in healthy populations. An additional acquired loss of function has been reported in up to one-third of cancer patients. It is not known whether this phenomenon also occurs in patients with earlier stage or in resected disease.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor frequently deleted in prostate cancer that may be a useful prognostic biomarker. However, the association of PTEN loss with lethal disease has not been tested in a large, predominantly surgically treated cohort.
PTEN is a protein phosphatase that is crucial to prevent the malignant transformation of T-cells. Although a numerous mechanisms regulate its expression and function, they are often altered in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias and T-cell lymphomas. As such, PTEN inactivation frequently occurs in these malignancies, where it can be associated with chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis. Different Pten knockout models recapitulated the development of T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma, demonstrating that PTEN loss is at the center of a complex oncogenic network that sustains and drives tumorigenesis via the activation of multiple signalling pathways. These aspects and their therapeutic implications are discussed in this review.
CD36 is a major macrophage scavenger receptor for oxidised low-density lipoprotein particles. Soluble CD36 (sCD36) is circulating as a ligand-bound complex and may be present in microparticles shed from cells such as platelets, monocytes/macrophages, or adipocytes. Positive association of plasma sCD36 with insulin resistance has been reported, and it has been proposed that sCD36 might represent a marker of macrophage activation and inflammation leading to atherosclerosis. Recently we have identified an association between CD36 polymorphism and low thickness of atheromatous plaque, suggesting its protective effect against atherosclerosis development.
CD36 is a member of the class B scavenger receptor family of cell surface proteins, which plays a major role in fatty acid, glucose and lipid metabolism. Besides, CD36 functions as a microglial surface receptor for amyloid beta peptide. Regarding this, we suggest CD36 might also contribute to neuropsychiatric disease. The aim of this study was to achieve a behavioral phenotype of CD36 knockout (CD36(-/-)) mice. We characterized the behavior of CD36(-/-) mice and C57BL/6J mice by subjecting them to a series of tests, which include SHIRPA primary behavioral screen test, 1% sucrose preference test, elevated plus-maze test, open-field test and forced swimming test. The results showed that CD36(-/-) mice traversed more squares, emitted more defecation, exhibited higher tail elevation and had more aggressive behaviors than C57BL/6J mice. The CD36(-/-) mice spent more time and traveled longer distance in periphery zone in the open-field test. Meanwhile, the numbers that CD36(-/-) mice entered in the open arms of elevated plus-maze were reduced. These findings suggest that CD36(-/-) mice present an anxious phenotype and might be involved in neuropsychiatric disorders. 
CD36 is involved in oxidant stress, hyperlipidemia, and thrombosis in the pathology of stroke. CD 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were reported to be associated with abnormalities of serum FA, triglyceride level and to increase risk of metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. Based on these finding we hypothesized that CD36 is an important candidate gene of stroke; therefore, we set out a case-control study to explore the association of CD36 SNPs with ischemic stroke.
PTEN is a tumour suppressor frequently mutated in many types of cancers. Here we show that targeted disruption of PTEN leads to neoplastic transformation of human neural stem cells (NSCs), but not mesenchymal stem cells. PTEN-deficient NSCs display neoplasm-associated metabolic and gene expression profiles and generate intracranial tumours in immunodeficient mice. PTEN is localized to the nucleus in NSCs, binds to the PAX7 promoter through association with cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB)/CREB binding protein (CBP) and inhibits PAX7 transcription. PTEN deficiency leads to the upregulation of PAX7, which in turn promotes oncogenic transformation of NSCs and instates 'aggressiveness' in human glioblastoma stem cells. In a large clinical database, we find increased PAX7 levels in PTEN-deficient glioblastoma. Furthermore, we identify that mitomycin C selectively triggers apoptosis in NSCs with PTEN deficiency. Together, we uncover a potential mechanism of how PTEN safeguards NSCs, and establish a cellular platform to identify factors involved in NSC transformation, potentially permitting personalized treatment of glioblastoma. 
PTEN is a powerful tumor suppressor that antagonizes the cytoplasmic PI3K-AKT pathway and suppresses cellular proliferation. PTEN also plays a role in the maintenance of genomic stability in the nucleus. Here we report that PTEN facilitates DNA decatenation and controls a decatenation checkpoint. Catenations of DNA formed during replication are decatenated by DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2), and this process is actively monitored by a decatenation checkpoint in G2 phase. We found that PTEN deficient cells form ultra-fine bridges (UFBs) during anaphase and these bridges are generated as a result of insufficient decatenation. We show that PTEN is physically associated with a decatenation enzyme TOP2A and that PTEN influences its stability through OTUD3 deubiquitinase. In the presence of PTEN, ubiquitination of TOP2A is inhibited by OTUD3. Deletion or deficiency of PTEN leads to down regulation of TOP2A, dysfunction of the decatenation checkpoint and incomplete DNA decatenation in G2 and M phases. We propose that PTEN controls DNA decatenation to maintain genomic stability and integrity. 
FIG4 is a phosphoinositide phosphatase that is mutated in several diseases including Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease 4J (CMT4J) and Yunis-Varon syndrome (YVS). To investigate the mechanism of disease pathogenesis, we generated Drosophila models of FIG4-related diseases. Fig4 null mutant animals are viable but exhibit marked enlargement of the lysosomal compartment in muscle cells and neurons, accompanied by an age-related decline in flight ability. Transgenic animals expressing Drosophila Fig4 missense mutations corresponding to human pathogenic mutations can partially rescue lysosomal expansion phenotypes, consistent with these mutations causing decreased FIG4 function. Interestingly, Fig4 mutations predicted to inactivate FIG4 phosphatase activity rescue lysosome expansion phenotypes, and mutations in the phosphoinositide (3) phosphate kinase Fab1 that performs the reverse enzymatic reaction also causes a lysosome expansion phenotype. Since FIG4 and FAB1 are present together in the same biochemical complex, these data are consistent with a model in which FIG4 serves a phosphatase-independent biosynthetic function that is essential for lysosomal membrane homeostasis. Lysosomal phenotypes are suppressed by genetic inhibition of Rab7 or the HOPS complex, demonstrating that FIG4 functions after endosome-to-lysosome fusion. Furthermore, disruption of the retromer complex, implicated in recycling from the lysosome to Golgi, does not lead to similar phenotypes as Fig4, suggesting that the lysosomal defects are not due to compromised retromer-mediated recycling of endolysosomal membranes. These data show that FIG4 plays a critical noncatalytic function in maintaining lysosomal membrane homeostasis, and that this function is disrupted by mutations that cause CMT4J and YVS. 
CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme expressed in a variety of mammalian tissues, its catalytic activity was involved in a wide range of physiological processes. Based on the reported inhibitor of human CD38 NADase, 33 purine derivatives were designed and synthesized. The biological activity assay showed that compounds 20 and 38 exhibited almost the same extent of inhibitory activities on human CD38 NADase as the lead compound H2. The results also revealed that small substituents at C-6 of purine ring gave no obvious effect on inhibitory activity, but phenylpropionyl moiety at N-2 could affect the binding mode of the compound with CD38. This study provides a reliable basis for future rational design of inhibitors for CD38.
CYP2C9 enzyme contributes to the metabolism of several pharmaceuticals and xenobiotics and yet displays large person-to-person and interethnic variation. Understanding the mechanisms of CYP2C9 variation is thus of immense importance for personalized medicine and rational therapeutics. A genetic variant of P450 (cytochrome) oxidoreductase (POR), a CYP450 redox partner, is reported to influence CYP2C9 metabolic activity in vitro. We investigated the impact of a common variant, POR*28, on CYP2C9 metabolic activity in humans. 148 healthy Swedish and 146 healthy Korean volunteers were genotyped for known CYP2C9 defective variant alleles (CYP2C9*2, *3). The CYP2C9 phenotype was determined using a single oral dose of 50 mg losartan. Excluding oral contraceptive (OC) users and carriers of 2C9*2 and *3 alleles, 117 Korean and 65 Swedish were genotyped for POR*5, *13 and *28 using Taqman assays. The urinary losartan to its metabolite E-3174 metabolic ratio (MR) was used as an index of CYP2C9 metabolic activity. The allele frequency of the POR*28 variant allele in Swedes and Koreans was 29% and 44%, respectively. POR*5 and *13 were absent in both study populations. Considering the CYP2C9*1/*1 genotypes only, the CYP2C9 metabolic activity was 1.40-fold higher in carriers of POR*28 allele than non-carriers among Swedes (p = 0.02). By contrast, no influence of the POR*28 on CYP2C9 activity was found in Koreans (p = 0.68). The multivariate analysis showed that ethnicity, POR genotype, and smoking were strong predictors of CYP2C9 MR (p < 0.05). This is the first report to implicate the importance of POR*28 genetic variation for CYP2C9 metabolic activity in humans. These findings contribute to current efforts for global personalized medicine and using medicines by taking into account pharmacogenetic and phenotypic variations.
CYP2A6 genotyping is of clinical importance--CYP2A6 gene variants influence nicotine metabolism and are associated with nicotine dependence, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation and the risk for tobacco-associated cancers. CYP2A6 gene variants also influence the metabolism of therapeutic drugs, such as the anticancer agents, tegafur and letrozole. Over the years, CYP2A6 genotyping methods have evolved to incorporate novel gene variants and to circumvent genotyping errors resulting from the high degree of homology between CYP2A6 and neighboring CYP2A genes. Herein, CYP2A6 genotyping strategies are described for commonly genotyped functionally significant alleles including SNPs, small insertions/deletions and more complex structural variants. The methods presented utilize higher throughput SYBR green real-time PCR technology in addition to standard thermocycling.
CYP2B6 is a highly polymorphic isoenzyme involved in the metabolism of many drugs including cyclophosphamide, bupropion, and efavirenz. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CYP2B6 (516G>T) resulted in decreased expression and function associated with the CYP2B6*6 haplotype. Among the clinical implications of this phenotype, decreased activation of cyclophosphamide and increased plasma levels of efavirenz associated with increased central nervous system toxicity have been reported. The frequency of the CYP2B6 (516G>T) SNP has been studied in several different populations, but there is no data regarding distribution among Argentinians. In this study, 102 DNA samples from healthy volunteers were analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism reaction specific for the CYP2B6 (516G>T) SNP. Our results showed a prevalence of 71.08% for the G allele and 28.92% for the T allele. This was distributed as 52.9% for the GG genotype (reduced dosage required), 36.6% for the GT genotype (normal dosage range), and 10.8% for the TT genotype (high drug toxicity). There was no preferential gender distribution observed. The relatively high prevalence of the TT genotype in our population supports the clinical use of genotyping as an additional tool in personalized medicine. 
FUT1 and TAP1 have been identified as candidate genes that offer resistance against Escherichia coli F18 infection, with the AA genotype in FUT1 and the GG genotype in TAP1 conferring resistance. In order to confirm polymorphisms at FUT1 M307 and TAP1 G729, and evaluate their influence on immunity performance in Pudong White pigs, we performed polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, measured immune indices, and compared the results with those observed in Large White pigs. The AA genotype of FUT1 was first discovered in Pudong White pigs and has not been found in other Chinese domestic pig breeds. The frequency of the AA genotype in Pudong White and Large White pigs was 0.018 and 0.052, respectively. The GG genotype of TAP1 was also detected in the two breeds, with a frequency of 0.708 and 0.695, respectively. Chi-square fitness analysis of both genes showed that these loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the two breeds (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 levels among the three genotypes at FUT1 and TAP1 in the two breeds (P > 0.05). Individuals for all genotypes of TAP1 in both pig breeds had similar TNF-α levels (P > 0.05), implying that Pudong White pigs may have the same ability for hepatocyte inflammatory response and B cell differentiation as Large White pigs. These differences have a degree of influence on Pudong White pig's immune ability to resist F18 or other infections. 
PAH bioaccessibility in contaminated soil was determined using the organic physiologically based extraction test with the inclusion of a sorption sink. Silicone cord was incorporated into the assay in order to overcome the limited capacity of the in vitro medium to accommodate desorbable PAHs. Initially, silicone cord sorption efficacy was determined by assessing sorption kinetics using PAH-spiked sand (phenanthrene, pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene; 10-1000mgkg(-1)). Irrespective of PAH and concentration, >95% of the initial PAH mass partitioned into the silicone cord within 12h although rates were lower at higher concentration and with increasing hydrophobicity. When PAH bioaccessibility was assessed in contaminated soil (n=18), contamination source (i.e. pyrogenic versus petrogenic) influenced PAH bioaccessibility. Individual PAH bioaccessibility ranged up to 81.7±2.7% although mean values ranged from 2.1 (acenaphthalene) to 20.8% (benzo[k]fluoranthene) with upper 95% confidence intervals of the means of 4.5 and 28.3% respectively. Although a PAH in vivo-in vitro correlation is yet to be established, bioaccessibility approaches incorporating sorption sinks represent a robust approach for estimating PAH bioavailability as the desorbable fraction may be a conservative measure of the absorbable fraction. 
PTEN Hamartoma Tumor syndrome (PHTS) encompasses a clinical spectrum of heritable disorders including Cowden syndrome (CS), Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, and Proteus and Proteus-like syndrome that are associated with germline mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. Breast cancer risk estimates (67-85 %) for women with germline PTEN mutations are similar to those quoted for patients with germline mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes. With PTEN on several germline gene testing panels, finding PTEN mutations and variants have increased exponentially. PHTS can be differentiated from other hereditary cancer syndromes including Hereditary Breast Ovarian Cancer syndrome, Lynch syndrome, and hamartomatous polyposis syndromes based on personal as well as family history. However, many of the benign features of CS are common in the general population, making the diagnosis of CS challenging. Breast cancer patients with an identified germline PTEN mutation are at increased risk of endometrial, thyroid, renal, and colorectal cancers as well as a second breast cancer. Increased screening for the various component cancers as well as predictive testing in first-degree relatives is recommended. Prophylactic mastectomy may be considered especially if breast tissue is dense or if repeated breast biopsies have been necessary. Management of women with breast cancer suspected of CS who test negative for germline PTEN mutations should be managed as per a mutation carrier if she meets CS diagnostic criteria, and should be offered enrollment in research to identify other predisposition genes.
GLO1 (Glyoxalase1) is a ubiquitous cellular enzyme that detoxifies methylglyoxal (MG), which is a byproduct of glycolysis. Previously, we showed that ubiquitous overexpression of Glo1 reduced concentrations of MG and increased anxiety-like behavior, whereas systemic injection of MG reduced anxiety-like behavior. We further showed that MG is a competitive partial agonist at GABA-A receptors. Based on those data we hypothesized that modulation of GABAergic signaling by MG underlies Glo1 and MG's effects on anxiety-like behavior. As previous studies used ubiquitous overexpression, we sought to determine whether neuronal Glo1 overexpression was sufficient to increase anxiety-like behavior. We generated ROSA26 knock-in mice with a floxed-stop codon upstream from human Glo1 (FLOXGlo1KI) and bred them with mice expressing CRE recombinase under the direction of the Synapsin 1 promoter (Syn-CRE) to limit overexpression of Glo1 specifically to neurons. Furthermore, since previous administration of MG had been systemic, we sought to determine if direct microinjection of MG into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) was sufficient to reduce anxiety-like behavior. Thus, we performed bilateral microinjections of saline, MG (12μM or 24μM), or the positive control midazolam (4mM) directly into the BLA. FLOXGlo1KIxSyn-CRE mice showed significantly increased anxiety-like behavior compared to their FLOXGLO1xWT littermates. In addition, bilateral microinjection of MG and midazolam significantly decreased anxiety-like behavior compared to saline treated mice. These studies suggest that anatomically specific manipulations of Glo1 and MG are sufficient to induce changes in anxiety-like behavior.
CYP2C19 is a highly polymorphic gene and CYP2C19 enzyme results in broad inter-individual variability in response to certain clinical drugs, while little is known about the genetic variation of CYP2C19 in Li Chinese population. The aim of this study was to identify different CYP2C19 mutant alleles and determine their frequencies, along with genotype frequencies, in the Li Chinese population. We used DNA sequencing to investigate promoter, exons, introns, and 3'UTR of the CYP2C19 gene in 100 unrelated healthy Li individuals from Hainan Province, China. We also used SIFT and PolyPhen-2 to predict the protein function of the non-synonymous mutation in CYP2C19 coding regions. We identified 22 different CYP2C19 polymorphisms in the Li Chinese population, including three novel variants (-254A > G, 17807T > C and 58025C > T). The allele frequencies of CYP2C19*1A, *1B, *2A and *3A were 50%, 24%, 24.5%, and 1.5%, respectively. The most common genotype combinations were *1A/*1B (48%) and *1A/*2A (49%). Additionally, the mutation Ala161Pro was predicted to be intolerant and possibly damaging by SIFT and PolyPhen-2, respectively. Our results shed new light on CYP2C19 polymorphisms in Li individuals, which may help to optimize pharmacotherapy effectiveness by providing personalized medicine to this ethnic group. 
PIK3CA has been shown to be involved in many malignant tumors. This study was designed to determine the expression level of PIK3CA in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and the association of gene polymorphisms of PIK3CA with OSCC in Chinese population. The expression of PIK3CA was detected by real-time PCR in tumor and pericarcinomatous tissues of 10 OSCC patients. Nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PIK3CA (rs1607237, rs17849079, rs2677764, rs2699887, rs4855094, rs4975596, rs6443624, rs7651265 and rs7736074) in blood of 113 OSCC patients and 184 normal controls were genotyped using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) assay. The gene expression of PIK3CA was significantly higher in tumor tissues of OSCC patients than that in pericarcinomatous tissues (P = 0.012). An increased frequency of the C allele of PIK3CA rs1607237 was observed in OSCC patients as compared with controls; However, the significance was lost after Bonferroni correction (P = 0.048, pc = 0.576). In further stratification analysis, although the frequencies of PIK3CA rs4975596 A allele in male patients and rs1607237 C allele in female patients were increased (P = 0.032, P = 0.020, respectively), the significance was also missing when Bonferroni correction was performed (P c = 0.384, (P c = 0.24, respectively). The prevalence of other SNPs of PIK3CA did not differ between OSCC patients and controls. The expression of PIK3CA was increased in OSCC tumors; however, none of the nine tested SNPs of PIK3CA was associated with susceptibility to OSCC in the studied population. 
ABCB1 is a key ABC efflux transporter modulating the pharmacokinetics of a large percentage of drugs. ABCB1 is also a site of transporter mediated drug-drug interactions (tDDI). It is the transporter most frequently tested for tDDIs both in vitro and in the clinic.
PTEN deletion in the mouse and in the zebrafish highlights the essential role of this tumor suppressor in the development of myeloid malignancies, in particular acute myeloid leukemia and myeloproliferative disorders. In humans, extensive genetic sequences of myeloid malignancies did not reveal recurrent PTEN mutations and deletions. However, PTEN was shown to be functionally inactivated in several acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia samples, through both post-trasductional modifications, changes in protein levels and cellular compartmentalization. Notably, non genomic inactivation of PTEN in myeloid malignancies could represent a challenging therapeutic opportunity for these diseases. Targeting those mechanisms that affect PTEN function could indeed promote PTEN reactivation with consequent cancer selective apoptosis induction. In this review we will describe the role of PTEN in the development of myeloid malignancies. 
GBA mutations are to date the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease. The GBA gene encodes the lysomal hydrolase glucocerebrosidase. Whilst bi-allelic GBA mutations cause Gaucher disease, both mono- and bi-allelic mutations confer risk for Parkinson's disease. Clinically, Parkinson's disease patients with GBA mutations resemble idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients. However, these patients have a modest reduction in age-of-onset of disease and a greater incidence of cognitive decline. In some cases, GBA mutations are also responsible for familial Parkinson's disease. The accumulation of α-synuclein into Lewy bodies is the central neuropathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Pathologic GBA mutations reduce enzymatic function. A reduction in glucocerebrosidase function increases α-synuclein levels and propagation, which in turn inhibits glucocerebrosidase in a feed-forward cascade. This cascade is central to the neuropathology of GBA-associated Parkinson's disease. The lysosomal integral membrane protein type-2 is necessary for normal glucocerebrosidase function. Glucocerebrosidase dysfunction also increases in the accumulation of β-amyloid and amyloid-precursor protein, oxidative stress, neuronal susceptibility to metal ions, microglial and immune activation. These factors contribute to neuronal death. The Mendelian Parkinson's disease genes, Parkin and ATP13A2, intersect with glucocerebrosidase. These factors sketch a complex circuit of GBA-associated neuropathology. To clinically interfere with this circuit, central glucocerebrosidase function must be improved. Strategies based on reducing breakdown of mutant glucocerebrosidase and increasing the fraction that reaches the lysosome has shown promise. Breakdown can be reduced by interfering with the ability of heat-shock proteins to recognize mutant glucocerebrosidase. This underlies the therapeutic efficacy of certain pharmacological chaperones and histone deacetylase inhibitors. These therapies are promising for Parkinson's disease, regardless of mutation status. Recently, there has been a boom in studies investigating the role of glucocerebrosidase in the pathology of Parkinson's disease. This merits a comprehensive review of the current cell biological processes and pathological pictures involving Parkinson's disease associated with GBA mutations.
MTAP is a ubiquitously expressed gene important for adenine and methionine salvage. The gene is located at 9p21, a chromosome region often deleted in breast carcinomas, similar to CDKN2A, a recognized tumor suppressor gene. Several research groups have shown that MTAP acts as a tumor suppressor, and some therapeutic approaches were proposed based on a tumors´ MTAP status. We analyzed MTAP and CDKN2A gene (RT-qPCR) and protein (western-blotting) expression in seven breast cancer cell lines and evaluated their promoter methylation patterns to better characterize the contribution of these genes to breast cancer. Cytotoxicity assays with inhibitors of de novo adenine synthesis (5-FU, AZA and MTX) after MTAP gene knockdown showed an increased sensitivity, mainly to 5-FU. MTAP expression was also evaluated in two groups of samples from breast cancer patients, fresh tumors and paired normal breast tissue, and from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) core breast cancer samples diagnosed as Luminal-A tumors and triple negative breast tumors (TNBC). The difference of MTAP expression between fresh tumors and normal tissues was not statistically significant. However, MTAP expression was significantly higher in Luminal-A breast tumors than in TNBC, suggesting the lack of expression in more aggressive breast tumors and the possibility of using the new approaches based on MTAP status in TNBC. 
G6PD deficiency (G6PDd) is the commonest genetic enzyme defect in the world. However, baring a single case report, there is no published literature regarding the safety of donor hepatectomy in G6PDd individuals.
SQLE encodes squalene epoxidase, a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. SQLE has sporadically been reported among copy-number driven transcripts in multi-omics cancer projects. Yet, its functional relevance has never been subjected to systematic analyses. Here, we assessed the correlation of SQLE copy number (CN) and gene expression (GE) across multiple cancer types, focusing on the clinico-pathological associations in breast cancer (BC). We then investigated whether any biological effect of SQLE inhibition could be observed in BC cell line models. Breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers showed the highest CN driven GE among 8,783 cases from 22 cancer types, with BC presenting the strongest one. SQLE overexpression was more prevalent in aggressive BC, and was an independent prognostic factor of unfavorable outcome. Through SQLE pharmacological inhibition and silencing in a panel of BC cell lines portraying the diversity of SQLE CN and GE, we demonstrated that SQLE inhibition resulted in a copy-dosage correlated decrease in cell viability, and in a noticeable increase in replication time, only in lines with detectable SQLE transcript. Altogether, our results pinpoint SQLE as a bona fide metabolic oncogene by amplification, and as a therapeutic target in BC. These findings could have implications in other cancer types. 
ABCA3 is highly expressed in alveolar epithelial type 2 cells and is associated with surfactant homeostasis. Patients with ABCA3 mutations develop various respiratory complications, such as fatal respiratory distress syndrome or interstitial lung disease. We describe a patient with pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema with pulmonary hypertension, associated with compound heterozygous mutations of the ABCA3 gene. This is the first report showing that mutations in the ABCA3 gene lead to pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, including combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, in childhood. Treatment with prostacyclin analogue, warfarin, and inhaled oxygen was effective to improve patient's hemodynamic condition as well as pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema.

DOT1L is a histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase mainly implicated in leukemia. Here we analyzed the function of DOT1L in breast cancer cells. The expression of DOT1L was up-regulated in malignant breast cancer tissues. Over-expression of DOT1L significantly increased the sphere formation and the cell migration activities of MCF7 breast cancer cell line. In contrast, knockdown of DOT1L reduced the cell migration activity of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. BCAT1, which encodes a branched-chain amino acid transaminase, was identified as one of the target genes controlled by DOT1L through the regulation of H3K79 methylation. Mechanistic investigation revealed that BCAT1 might be an important regulator responsible for DOT1L-mediated sphere formation and cell migration in breast cancer cells. 
CYP24A1 (hereafter referred to as CYP24) enzymatic activity is pivotal in the inactivation of vitamin D metabolites. Basal renal and extrarenal CYP24 is usually low but is highly induced by its substrate 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Unbalanced high and/or long-lasting CYP24 expression has been proposed to underlie diseases like chronic kidney disease, cancers, and psoriasis that otherwise should favorably respond to supplemental vitamin D. Using genetically modified mice, we have shown that renal phosphate wasting hypophosphatemic states arising from high levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) are also associated with increased renal Cyp24 expression, suggesting that elevated CYP24 activity is pivotal to the pathophysiology of these disorders. We therefore crossed 2 mouse strains, each with distinct etiology for high levels of circulating FGF23, onto a Cyp24-null background. Specifically, we evaluated Cyp24 deficiency in Hyp mice, the murine homolog of X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets, and transgenic mice that overexpress a mutant FGF23 (FGF23R176Q) that is associated with the autosomal dominant form of hypophosphatemic rickets. Loss of Cyp24 in these murine models of human disease resulted in near-complete recovery of rachitic/osteomalacic bony abnormalities in the absence of any improvement in the serum biochemical profile. Moreover, treatment of Hyp and FGF23R1760-transgenic mice with the CYP24 inhibitor CTA102 also ameliorated their rachitic bones. Our results link CYP24 activity to the pathophysiology of FGF23-dependent renal phosphate wasting states and implicate pharmacologic CYP24 inhibition as a therapeutic adjunct for their treatment. 
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene which is involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Loss or down-regulation of PTEN plays an important role in human cancers development. In this study, we investigated the effect of miR-21 and promoter methylation on the PTEN expression status in CRC tissues and analyzed association of the PTEN expression status with clinicopathological features in patients with CRC.
ABCA1 and ABCG1 genes encode the cholesterol transporter proteins that play a key role in cholesterol and phospholipids homeostasis. This study was aimed at evaluating and comparing ABCA1 and ABCG1 genes expression in metabolic syndrome patients and healthy individuals. This case-control study was performed on 36 patients with metabolic syndrome and the same number of healthy individuals in Hamadan (west of Iran) during 2013-2014. Total RNA was extracted from mononuclear cells and purified using RNeasy Mini Kit column. The expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 genes was performed by qRT-PCR. Lipid profile and fasting blood glucose were measured using colorimetric procedures. ABCG1 expression in metabolic syndrome patients was significantly lower (about 75%) compared to that of control group, while for ABCA1 expression, there was no significant difference between the two studied groups. Comparison of other parameters such as HDL-C, FBS, BMI, waist circumference, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure between metabolic syndrome patients and healthy individuals showed significant differences (P < 0.05). Decrease in ABCG1 expression in metabolic syndrome patients compared to healthy individuals suggests that hyperglycemia, related metabolites, and hyperlipidemia over the transporter capacity resulted in decreased expression of ABCG1. Absence of a significant change in ABCA1 gene expression between two groups can indicate a different regulation mechanism for ABCA1 expression. 
ACP5 deficiency is known to cause spondyloenchondrodysplasia (SPENCD), which is characterized by various autoimmune and neurological symptoms in addition to short stature.
PTEN loss is prognostic for patient relapse post-radiotherapy in prostate cancer (CaP). Infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is associated with reduced disease-free survival following radical prostatectomy. However, the association between PTEN loss, TAM infiltration and radiotherapy response of CaP cells remains to be evaluated. Immunohistochemical and molecular analysis of surgically-resected Gleason 7 tumors confirmed that PTEN loss correlated with increased CXCL8 expression and macrophage infiltration. However PTEN status had no discernable correlation with expression of other inflammatory markers by CaP cells, including TNF-α. In vitro, exposure to conditioned media harvested from irradiated PTEN null CaP cells induced chemotaxis of macrophage-like THP-1 cells, a response partially attenuated by CXCL8 inhibition. Co-culture with THP-1 cells resulted in a modest reduction in the radio-sensitivity of DU145 cells. Cytokine profiling revealed constitutive secretion of TNF-α from CaP cells irrespective of PTEN status and IR-induced TNF-α secretion from THP-1 cells. THP-1-derived TNF-α increased NFκB pro-survival activity and elevated expression of anti-apoptotic proteins including cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP-1) in CaP cells, which could be attenuated by pre-treatment with a TNF-α neutralizing antibody. Treatment with a novel IAP antagonist, AT-IAP, decreased basal and TNF-α-induced cIAP-1 expression in CaP cells, switched TNF-α signaling from pro-survival to pro-apoptotic and increased radiation sensitivity of CaP cells in co-culture with THP-1 cells. We conclude that targeting cIAP-1 can overcome apoptosis resistance of CaP cells and is an ideal approach to exploit high TNF-α signals within the TAM-rich microenvironment of PTEN-deficient CaP cells to enhance response to radiotherapy. 
CLC secondary active transporters exchange Cl(-) for H(+). Crystal structures have suggested that the conformational change from occluded to outward-facing states is unusually simple, involving only the rotation of a conserved glutamate (Gluex) upon its protonation. Using (19)F NMR, we show that as [H(+)] is increased to protonate Gluex and enrich the outward-facing state, a residue ~20 Å away from Gluex, near the subunit interface, moves from buried to solvent-exposed. Consistent with functional relevance of this motion, constriction via inter-subunit cross-linking reduces transport. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the cross-link dampens extracellular gate-opening motions. In support of this model, mutations that decrease steric contact between Helix N (part of the extracellular gate) and Helix P (at the subunit interface) remove the inhibitory effect of the cross-link. Together, these results demonstrate the formation of a previously uncharacterized 'outward-facing open' state, and highlight the relevance of global structural changes in CLC function. 
SLC26A6 is a multifunctional anion transporter with a critical physiological role in the transport of oxalate anions. Recognizing a genetic variant of SLC26A6 would advance our understanding of oxalate transport in the formation of calcium oxalate stones.
PTEN loss and PIK3CA activation both promote the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). While these proteins also have distinct biochemical functions, beyond the regulation of PIP3, little is known about the consequences of these differences in vivo. Here, we directly compared cancer signalling in mammary tumors from MMTV-Cre:Ptenf/f and MMTV-Cre:Pik3ca(LSL-H1047R) mice. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering we found that whereas MMTV-Cre:Pik3ca(LSL-H1047R)-derived tumors fall into two separate groups, designated squamous-likeEx and class14(Ex), MMTV-Cre:Ptenf/f tumors cluster as one group together with PIK3CA(H1047R) class14(Ex), exhibiting a 'luminal' expression profile. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of Pten(Δ) and PIK3CA(H1047R) class14(Ex) tumors revealed very similar profiles of signalling pathways as well as some interesting differences. Analysis of 18 signalling signatures revealed that PI3K signalling is significantly induced whereas EGFR signalling is significantly reduced in Pten(∆) versus PIK3CA(H1047R) tumors. Thus, Pten(∆) and PIK3CA(H1047R) tumors exhibit discernable differences that may impact tumorigenesis and response to therapy.
DHCR24 encodes 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ(24)-reductase (DHCR24) catalyzing the cholesterol synthesis from desmosterol using the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a co-factor. It is generally accepted that U18666a inhibits the reductase activity of DHCR24, but the detailed mechanism remains elusive. To explore the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of U18666a on DHCR24, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of two complexes including complexes of DHCR24-FAD-desmosterol enzymatic reactive components with and without the inhibitor U18666a. We found that the U18666a bound into the hydrophobic package near the FAD package of DHCR24. Furthermore, binding free energy of DHCR24 and desmosterol without U18666a is -54.86 kcal/mol, while the system with U18666a is -62.23 kcal/mol, suggesting that the affinity of the substrate desmosterol to DHCR24 was increased in response to the U18666a. In addition, U18666a interacts with FAD by newly forming three hydrogen bonds with Lys292, Lys367, and Gly438 of DHCR24. Finally, secondary structural analysis data obtained from the surrounding hot spots showed that U18666a induced dramatic secondary structural changes around the key residues in the interaction of DHCR24, FAD, and desmosterol. Taken together, these results for the first time demonstrate at the molecular structure level that U18666a blocks DHCR24 activity through an allosteric inhibiting mechanism, which may provide new insight into the development of a new type of cholesterol-lowering drug targeting to block the activity of DHCR24.
"IDH1 and IDH2 are homodimeric enzymes that catalyze the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and concomitantly produce reduced NADPH from NADP(+) Mutations in the genes encoding IDH1 and IDH2 have recently been found in a variety of human cancers, most commonly glioma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chondrosarcoma, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The mutant protein loses its normal enzymatic activity and gains a new ability to produce the ""oncometabolite"" R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2-HG). R-2-HG competitively inhibits α-KG-dependent enzymes which play crucial roles in gene regulation and tissue homeostasis. Expression of mutant IDH impairs cellular differentiation in various cell lineages and promotes tumor development in cooperation with other cancer genes. First-generation inhibitors of mutant IDH have entered clinical trials, and have shown encouraging results in patients with IDH-mutant AML. This article summarizes recent progress in our understanding of the role of mutant IDH in tumorigenesis.Clin Cancer Res; 22(8); 1837-42. ©2016 AACR. "
PTEN has been heavily studied due to its role as a tumour suppressor and as a core inhibitory component of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling network. It is a broadly expressed phosphatase which displays complexity and diversity in both its functions and regulation and accordingly, in the laboratory numerous classes of functionally distinct mutations have been generated. Inherited loss of function mutations in the PTEN gene were originally identified in sufferers of Cowden disease, but later shown to associate with more diverse human pathologies, mostly relating to cell and tissue overgrowth, leading to the use of the broader term, PTEN Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome. Recent phenotypic analysis of clinical cohorts of PTEN mutation carriers, combined with laboratory studies of the consequences of these mutations implies that stable catalytically inactive PTEN mutants may lead to the most severe phenotypes, and conversely, that mutants retaining partial function associate more frequently with a milder phenotype, with autism spectrum disorder often being diagnosed. Future work will be needed to confirm and to refine these genotype-phenotype relationships and convert this developing knowledge into improved patient management and potentially treatment with emerging drugs which target the PI3K pathway. 
CYP1A1 is a candidate gene for low-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility, as it plays an important role in the metabolism of carcinogens and estrogens.
CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene citrate (CC). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between CYP2D6 genotypes, concentrations of CC and its major metabolites and drug response in infertility patients. We studied 42 patients with ovulatory dysfunction treated with only CC. Patients received a dose of 100 mg/day CC on days 3-7 of the menstrual cycle. CYP2D6 genotyping and measurement of CC and the major metabolite concentrations were performed. Patients were categorized into CC responders or non-responders according to one cycle response for the ovulation. Thirty-two patients were CC responders and 10 patients were non-responders with 1 cycle treatment. The CC concentrations were highly variable within the same group, but non-responders revealed significantly lower (E)-clomiphene concentration and a trend of decreased concentrations of active metabolites compared to the responders. Nine patients with intermediate metabolizer phenotype were all responders. We confirmed that the CC and the metabolite concentrations were different according to the ovulation status. However, our results do not provide evidence for the contribution of CYP2D6 polymorphism to either drug response or CC concentrations. 
CFTR is an anionic channel expressed in epithelia whose mutations cause cystic fibrosis. Wild (WT) and mutated (F508del) types were over-expressed in yeast, solubilised in the detergent LPG-14 and purified. The detergent-CFTR complexes were studied by SAXS techniques using a solvent of variable density. The final result of the study is the numerical value of a set of parameters: molecular mass, volume and radius of gyration, average electron density and second moment of the electron density fluctuations inside the particles. It is also shown that in the complex the centres of gravity of CFTR and of the detergent are displaced relative to each other. The analysis of these parameters led to the determination of the size and shape of the volumes occupied by protein and by detergent in the complex. WT-CFTR to be an elongated molecule (maximum diameter ∼12.4nm) which spans a flat detergent micelle. The distance distribution function, P(r) confirms that the WT-CFTR is elongated and with an inhomogeneous electronic density. The F508del-CFTR molecule is also elongated (maximum diameter ∼13.2nm), but the associated detergent micelle hides a larger surface, plausibly related to an increased exposure of hydrophobic portions of the mutated protein. The corresponding P(r) is consistent with the presence of well defined domains, probably linked by flexible regions. These differences suggest that the full-length mutant F508del-CFTR has a detectably different conformation, in contrast to the minor differences observed for the isolated F508-containing domain. We interpret the data in terms of an incomplete post-translational assembly of the protein domains. 
CD38 is widely accepted as a marker for unfavorable prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nevertheless, its direct contribution to the disease pathogenesis is not very well understood. Recent data indicate that CD38 may promote CLL pathogenesis by enhancing proliferation in synergy with B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and by supporting migration and homing of CLL cells to secondary lymphoid organs, where the malignant cells receive support from the tumor microenvironment. CD38 may also contribute to a suppressed anticancer immune response through the production of tolerogenic compounds. This review first shortly summarizes the biology, expression, and function of CD38 in general and in CLL cells in more detail. Next, the current literature and open questions regarding a direct contribution of CD38 to CLL pathogenesis are critically reviewed. Finally, I discuss the potential of CD38 as therapeutic target in light of its possible roles in CLL and the promising results of clinical trials with CD38 antibodies in multiple myeloma (MM). 
CD38 is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of cyclic ADP ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate, both of which are involved in the mobilization of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. Recently, CD38 has been shown to regulate oxytocin release from hypothalamic neurons. Importantly, CD38 mutations are associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and CD38 knockout (CD38(-/-)) mice display ASD-like behavioral phenotypes including deficient parental behavior and poor social recognition memory. Although ASD and learning deficits commonly co-occur, the role of CD38 in learning and memory has not been investigated. We report that CD38(-/-) mice show deficits in various learning and memory tasks such as the Morris water maze, contextual fear conditioning, and the object recognition test. However, either long-term potentiation or long-term depression is not impaired in the hippocampus of CD38(-/-) mice. Our results provide convincing evidence that CD38(-/-) mice show deficits in various learning and memory tasks including spatial and non-spatial memory tasks. Our data demonstrate that CD38 is critical for regulating hippocampus-dependent learning and memory without modulating synaptic plasticity. 
CD38 is a multifunctional cell surface protein that has receptor as well as enzyme functions. The protein is generally expressed at low levels on various hematological and solid tissues, while plasma cells express particularly high levels of CD38. The protein is also expressed in a subset of hematological tumors, and shows especially broad and high expression levels in plasma cell tumors such as multiple myeloma (MM). Together, this triggered the development of various therapeutic CD38 antibodies, including daratumumab, isatuximab, and MOR202. Daratumumab binds a unique CD38 epitope and showed strong anti-tumor activity in preclinical models. The antibody engages diverse mechanisms of action, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, programmed cell death, modulation of enzymatic activity, and immunomodulatory activity. CD38-targeting antibodies have a favorable toxicity profile in patients, and early clinical data show a marked activity in MM, while studies in other hematological malignancies are ongoing. Daratumumab has single agent activity and a limited toxicity profile, allowing favorable combination therapies with existing as well as emerging therapies, which are currently evaluated in the clinic. Finally, CD38 antibodies may have a role in the treatment of diseases beyond hematological malignancies, including solid tumors and antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. 
CES1 encodes carboxylesterase-1, an important drug-metabolizing enzyme with high expression in the liver. Previous studies have reported a genomic translocation of the 5' region from the poorly expressed pseudogene CES1P1, to CES1, yielding the structural variant CES1VAR. The aim of this study was to characterize this translocation and its effect on CES1 expression in the human liver.
PLA2G6 or GVIA calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2β) is identified as one of the NAFLD modifier genes in humans, and thought to be a target for NAFLD therapy. iPLA2β is known to play a house-keeping role in phospholipid metabolism and remodeling. However, its role in NAFLD pathogenesis has not been supported by results obtained from high-fat feeding of iPLA2β-null (PKO) mice. Unlike livers of human NAFLD and genetically obese rodents, fatty liver induced by high-fat diet is not associated with depletion of hepatic phospholipids. We therefore tested whether iPLA2β could regulate obesity and hepatic steatosis in leptin-deficient mice by cross-breeding PKO with ob/ob mice to generate ob/ob-PKO mice. Here we observed an improvement in ob/ob-PKO mice with significant reduction in serum enzymes, lipids, glucose, insulin as well as improved glucose tolerance, and reduction in islet hyperplasia. The improvement in hepatic steatosis measured by liver triglycerides, fatty acids and cholesterol esters was associated with decreased expression of PPARγ and de novo lipogenesis genes, and the reversal of β-oxidation gene expression. Notably, ob/ob livers contained depleted levels of lysophospholipids and phospholipids, and iPLA2β deficiency in ob/ob-PKO livers lowers the former, but replenished the latter particularly phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) that contained arachidonic (AA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. Compared with WT livers, PKO livers also contained increased PE and PC containing AA and DHA. Thus, iPLA2β deficiency protected against obesity and ob/ob fatty liver which was associated with hepatic fatty-acyl phospholipid remodeling. Our results support the deleterious role of iPLA2β in severe obesity associated NAFLD. 
CYP1A1 is a phase I xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme whose expression is mainly driven by AhR. Endosulfan is an organochlorine pesticide used agriculturally for a wide range of crops. In this study, we investigated the effect of endosulfan on CYP1A1 expression and regulation. Endosulfan significantly increased CYP1A1 enzyme activity as well as mRNA and protein levels. In addition, endosulfan markedly induced XRE transcriptional activity. CH-223191, an AhR antagonist, blocked the endosulfan-induced increase in CYP1A1 mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, endosulfan did not induce CYP1A1 gene expression in AhR-deficient mutant cells. Furthermore, endosulfan enhanced the phosphorylation of calcium calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) and protein kinase C (PKC). In conclusion, endosulfan-induced up-regulation of CYP1A1 is associated with AhR activation, which may be mediated by PKC-dependent pathways. 
ATP8B1 deficiency is an autosomal recessive liver disease characterized by intrahepatic cholestasis. ATP8B1 mutation p.I661T, the most frequent mutation in European patients, results in protein misfolding and impaired targeting to the plasma membrane. Similarly, mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), associated with cystic fibrosis, impair protein folding and trafficking. The aim of this study was to investigate whether compounds that rescue CFTR F508del trafficking are capable of improving p.I661T-ATP8B1 plasma membrane expression.
CYP2D6 is a high polymorphic enzyme. Determining its phenotype before CYP2D6 substrate treatment can avoid dose-dependent adverse events or therapeutic failures. Alternative phenotyping methods of CYP2D6 were compared to aluate the appropriate and precise time points for phenotyping after single-dose and ultiple-dose of 30-mg controlled-release (CR) dextromethorphan (DM) and to explore the antimodes for potential sampling methods.
ALDH1A1 is one of the promising cancer stem cell markers, it has been found in different cancers, including lung cancer. We aimed to assess its immunohistochemical expression in spectral lung lesions (neoplastic versus non neoplastic) and to correlate its expression with certain pathological parameters (e.g. histopathological type and tumor grade).
SLC34A2 had been reported to be down-regulated in human NSCLC cells and patient tissues, and played a significant role in lung cancer. However, the mechanism of its unusual expressionin NSCLC has not been fully elucidated. In present study, we identified SLC34A2 was a direct target of miR-410 and could be inhibited by miR-410 transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. MiR-410 promoted the growth, invasion and migration of NSCLC cells in vitro. An orthotopic xenograft nude mouse model further affirmed that miR-410 promoted NSCLC cell growth and metastasis in vivo. Moreover, restoring SLC34A2 expression effectively reversed the miR-410-mediated promotion of cell growth, invasion and migration in NSCLC cells. In addition, miR-410high /SLC34A2low expression signature frequently existed in NSCLC cells and tumor tissues. MiR-410 significantly increased the expression of DVL2 and β-catenin protein while decreased that of Gsk3β protein of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, while SLC34A2 partly blocked the effects of miR-410 on those protein expressions. Hence, our data for the first time delineated that unusual expression of SLC34A2 was modulated by miR-410, and miR-410 might positivelycontribute to the tumorigenesis and development of NSCLC by down-regulating SLC34A2 and activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. MiR-410 might be a new potential therapeutic target for NSCLC. 
CD36 is a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the scavenger receptor class B family which plays crucial roles in innate immunity. Although CD36 is widely documented in mammals, the study of its functions in fish is still limited. Here we report the identification of a zebrafish cd36 homologue. Zebrafish cd36 has a higher gene expression in the tissues of intestine and liver but very low in kidney and swim bladder. We find cd36 mRNA is maternally expressed and is mainly restricted to the intestine, branchial arches and regions around the lips after the segmentation stage during embryogenesis. Functionally, the recombinant Cd36 corresponding to the large extracellular loop is capable of binding both the Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. These results indicate that zebrafish Cd36 is a microbial-binding molecule. The study expands our knowledge of the function of scavenger receptor molecules in fish innate immune process. 
PTEN is part of large family of tyrosine phosphatases and has been found inactivated in a wide variety of human cancers.
CP is the most common cause of chronic disability in childhood occurring in 2-2.5/1000 births. It is a severe disorder and a significant number of patients present cognitive delay and difficulty in walking. The use of botulinum toxin (BTX) has become a popular treatment for CP especially for spastic and dystonic muscles while avoiding deformity and pain. Moreover, the combination of physiotherapy, casting, orthotics and injection of BTX may delay or decrease the need for surgical intervention while reserving single-event, multi-level surgery for fixed musculotendinous contractures and bony deformities in older children. This report highlights the utility of BTX in the treatment of cerebral palsy in children. We include techniques for administration, side effects, and possible resistance as well as specific use in the upper and lower limbs muscles. 
ATP11C is a homolog of ATP8B1, both of which catalyze the transport of phospholipids in biological membranes. Mutations in ATP8B1 cause progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type1 in humans, which is characterized by a canalicular cholestasis. Mice deficient in ATP11C are characterized by a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and an unconjugated hypercholanemia. Here, we have studied the hypothesis that ATP11C deficiency interferes with basolateral uptake of unconjugated bile salts, a process mediated by organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B2. ATP11C localized to the basolateral membrane of central hepatocytes in the liver lobule of control mice. In ATP11C-deficient mice, plasma total bilirubin levels were 6-fold increased, compared to control, of which ∼65% was conjugated and ∼35% unconjugated. Plasma total bile salts were 10-fold increased and were mostly present as unconjugated species. Functional studies in ATP11C-deficient mice indicated that hepatic uptake of unconjugated bile salts was strongly impaired whereas uptake of conjugated bile salts was unaffected. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated near absence of basolateral bile salt uptake transporters OATP1B2, OATP1A1, OATP1A4, and Na(+) -taurocholate-cotransporting polypeptide only in central hepatocytes of ATP11C-deficient liver. In vivo application of the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, partially restored expression of these proteins, but not their localization. Furthermore, we observed post-translational down-regulation of ATP11C protein in livers from cholestatic mice, which coincided with reduced OATP1B2 levels.
SMYD3 is a SET domain-containing N-lysine methyltransferase associated with multiple cancers. Its reported substrates include histones (H3K4 and H4K5), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1 Lys(831)) and MAP3 kinase kinase (MAP3K2 Lys(260)). To reveal the structural basis for substrate preference and the catalytic mechanism of SMYD3, we have solved its co-crystal structures with VEGFR1 and MAP3K2 peptides. Our structural and biochemical analyses show that MAP3K2 serves as a robust substrate of SMYD3 because of the presence of a phenylalanine residue at the -2 position. A shallow hydrophobic pocket on SMYD3 accommodates the binding of the phenylalanine and promotes efficient catalytic activities of SMYD3. By contrast, SMYD3 displayed a weak activity toward a VEGFR1 peptide, and the location of the acceptor lysine in the folded kinase domain of VEGFR1 requires drastic conformational rearrangements for juxtaposition of the acceptor lysine with the enzymatic active site. Our results clearly revealed structural determinants for the substrate preference of SMYD3 and provided mechanistic insights into lysine methylation of MAP3K2. The knowledge should be useful for the development of SMYD3 inhibitors in the fight against MAP3K2 and Ras-driven cancer. 
CYP2B6 plays an increasingly important role in xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the pregnane X receptor (PXR) have been established as predominant regulators for the inductive expression of CYP2B6 gene in human liver. However, there are dramatic interindividual variabilities in CYP2B6 expression that cannot be fully explained by the CAR/PXR-based modulation alone. Here, we show that expression level of CYP2B6 was correlated with that of hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β (HNF3β) in human primary hepatocytes prepared from 35 liver donors. Utilizing recombinant virus-mediated overexpression or knockdown of HNF3β in HepG2 cells, as well as constructs containing serial deletion and site-directed mutation of HNF3β binding motifs in CYP2B6 luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrated that the presence or lack of HNF3β expression markedly correlated with CYP2B6 gene expression and its promoter activity. Novel enhancer modules of HNF3β located upstream of the CYP2B6 gene transcription start site were identified and functionally validated as key elements governing HNF3β-mediated CYP2B6 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in human primary hepatocytes and surface plasmon resonance binding affinity experiments confirmed the essential role of these enhancers in the recruitment of HNF3β to the promoter of CYP2B6 gene. Overall, these findings indicate that HNF3β represents a new liver enriched transcription factor that is involved in the transcription of CYP2B6 gene and contributes to the large interindividual variations of CYP2B6 expression in human population. 
CYP2D6 is one of the most important members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. Its genetic polymorphism significantly influences the efficacy and safety of some drugs, which might cause adverse effects and therapeutic failure.
ABO blood groups have been shown to be associated with increased risks of venous thromboembolic and arterial disease. However, the reported magnitude of this association is inconsistent and is based on evidence from small-scale studies.
ATP1B4 genes represent a rare instance of orthologous vertebrate gene co-option that radically changed properties of the encoded BetaM proteins, which function as Na,K-ATPase subunits in lower vertebrates and birds. Eutherian BetaM has lost its ancestral function and became a muscle-specific resident of the inner nuclear membrane. Our earlier work implicated BetaM in regulation of gene expression through direct interaction with the transcriptional co-regulator SKIP. To gain insight into evolution of BetaM interactome we performed expanded screening of eutherian and avian cDNA libraries using yeast-two-hybrid and split-ubiquitin systems. The inventory of identified BetaM interactors includes lamina-associated protein LAP-1, myocyte nuclear envelope protein Syne1, BetaM itself, heme oxidases HMOX1 and HMOX2; transcription factor LZIP/CREB3, ERGIC3, PHF3, reticulocalbin-3, and β-sarcoglycan. No new interactions were found for chicken BetaM and human Na,K-ATPase β1, β2 and β3 isoforms, indicating the uniqueness of eutherian BetaM interactome. Analysis of truncated forms of BetaM indicates that residues 72-98 adjacent to the membrane in nucleoplasmic domain are important for the interaction with SKIP. These findings demonstrate that evolutionary alterations in structural and functional properties of eutherian BetaM proteins are associated with the increase in its interactome complexity. 
ABCB1 and ABCG2 work together at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to limit brain distribution of dual ABCB1/ABCG2 substrates. In this pilot study we used positron emission tomography (PET) to assess brain distribution of two model ABCB1/ABCG2 substrates ([(11) C]elacridar and [(11) C]tariquidar) in healthy subjects without (c.421CC) or with (c.421CA) the ABCG2 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) c.421C>A. Subjects underwent PET scans under conditions when ABCB1 and ABCG2 were functional and during ABCB1 inhibition with high-dose tariquidar. In contrast to the ABCB1-selective substrate (R)-[(11) C]verapamil, [(11) C]elacridar and [(11) C]tariquidar showed only moderate increases in brain distribution during ABCB1 inhibition. This provides evidence for a functional interplay between ABCB1 and ABCG2 at the human BBB and suggests that both ABCB1 and ABCG2 need to be inhibited to achieve substantial increases in brain distribution of dual ABCB1/ABCG2 substrates. During ABCB1 inhibition c.421CA subjects had significantly higher increases in [(11) C]tariquidar brain distribution than c.421CC subjects, pointing to impaired cerebral ABCG2 function.
NSD1 is a SET-domain histone methyltransferase that methylates lysine 36 of histone 3. In the crystal structure of NSD1, the post-SET loop is in an autoinhibitory position that blocks binding of the histone peptide as well as the entrance to the lysine-binding channel. The conformational dynamics preceding histone binding and the mechanism by which the post-SET loop moves to accommodate the target lysine is currently unknown, although potential models have been proposed. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we have identified potential conformations of the post-SET loop differing from those of previous studies, as well as proposed a model of peptide-bound NSD1. Our simulations illustrate the dynamic behavior of the post-SET loop and the presence of a few distinct conformations. In every case, the post-SET loop remains in an autoinhibitory position blocking the peptide-binding cleft, suggesting that another interaction is required to optimally position NSD1 in an active conformation. This finding provides initial evidence for a mechanism by which NSD1 preferentially binds nucleosomal substrates. 
PC (pancreatic cancer) is the fourth most common cause of death due to cancer worldwide. The incidence and mortality rates have been increasing year by year worldwide, and this review has analyzed the most recent incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer occurrence in China. Several possible risk factors have been discussed here, involving known established risk factors and novel possible risk factors. The development of this cancer is a stepwise progression through intraepithelial neoplasia to carcinoma. Though early and accurate diagnosis is promising based on a combination of recent techniques including tumor markers and imaging modalities, lacking early clinical symptoms makes the diagnosis late. Correct staging is critical because treatment is generally based on this parameter. Treatment options have improved throughout the last decades. However, surgical excision remains the primary therapy and efficacy of conventional chemoradiotherapy for PC is limited. Recently, some novel new therapies have been developed and will be applied in clinics soon. This review will provide an overview of pancreatic cancer, including an understanding of the developments and controversies. 
CYP2D6 is involved in the biotransformation of a large number of drugs, including risperidone. This study was designed to detect CYP2D6 polymorphisms with a Luminex assay, including assessment the relationship of CYP2D6 polymorphisms and risperidone plasma concentration in autism spectrum disorder children (ASD) treated with risperidone. All 84 ASD patients included in this study had been receiving risperidone at least for 1 month. The CYP2D6 genotypes were determined by Luminex assay. Plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were measured using LC/MS/MS. Among the 84 patients, there were 46 (55.42%) classified as EM, 33 (39.76%) as IM, and 4(4.82%) as UM. The plasma concentration of risperidone and risperidone/9-hydroxyrisperidone ratio in the patients were significant differences among the CYP2D6 predicted phenotype group (P = 0.001 and P < 0.0001 respectively). Moreover, the plasma concentration of risperidone and risperidone/9-hydroxyrisperidone ratio in the patients with CYP2D6 activity score 0.5 were significantly higher than those with the CYP2D6 activity score 2.0 (P = 0.004 and P = 0.002 respectively). These findings suggested that the determination of the accurate CYP2D6 genotype-predicted phenotype is essential in the clinical setting and individualization of drug therapy. The use of the Luminex assay for detection of CYP2D6 polymorphisms could help us more accurately identify an individual's CYP2D6 phenotype.
AKR1B10 is involved in hepatocarcinogenesis via modulation of fatty acid and lipid synthesis. AKR1B10 inhibition results in apoptosis of tumor cells whose lipids, especially phospholipids, were decreased by over 50%, suggesting involvement of phospholipids like sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in AKR1B10's oncogenic function. Using a co-culture system, we found that co-culture of QSG-7701 (human hepatocyte) with HepG2 (hepatoma cell line) increases QSG-7701's proliferation, in which AKR1B10-S1P signaling plays a pivotal role. Consistent with previous findings, AKR1B10 mRNA and protein levels were higher in primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) tissues than in peri-tumor tissues. Interestingly, the level of S1P was also higher in PHC tissues than in peri-tumor tissues. After analyzing the correlation between AKR1B10 mRNA expression in PHC tissues and the clinical data, we found that AKR1B10 mRNA expression was associated with serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, and lymph node metastasis, but not with other clinicopathologic variables. A higher AKR1B10 mRNA expression level is related to a shorter DFS (disease free survival) and OS (overall survival), serving as an independent predictor of DFS and OS in PHC patients with surgical resection. 
CYP1A1 gene is involved in estrogen metabolism, and previously, we have reported association of variant rs2606345 with altered anti-epileptic drugs (AED) response in North Indian women with epilepsy (WWE). The present study aims to replicate the pharmacogenetic association, perform functional characterization and study its distribution within ethnically diverse Indian population. The variant was genotyped in 351 patients to assess the pharmacogenetic association and 552 healthy individuals belonging to 24 different ethnic groups to examine the distribution in Indian population. We observed significant overrepresentation of 'A' allele and 'AA' genotype in poor responders in WWE at Bonferroni-corrected significance levels. The recessive allele was found to lower the promoter activity by ~70-80% which was further substantiated by thermally less stable hairpin formed by it (ΔT
CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are transcriptionally activated in the human normal breast epithelial cell line MCF10A following exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Shifting MCF10A cultures to medium deficient in serum and epidermal growth factor (EGF) caused rapid reductions in the activated (i.e., phosphorylated) forms of extracellular regulated kinases (ERKs) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Shifting to serum/EGF-deficient medium also enhanced TCDD-mediated induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A1 Treatment of cells cultured in complete medium with the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib (Iressa), AG1478, and CI-1033 resulted in concentration-dependent reductions of active EGFR and ERKs, and increased CYP1A1 mRNA content ∼3- to 18-fold above basal level. EGFR inhibitors synergized with TCDD and resulted in transient CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNA accumulations ∼8-fold greater (maximum at 5 hours) than that achieved with only TCDD. AG1478, gefitinib, and TCDD individually induced small increases (∼1.2- to 2.5-fold) in CYP1A1 protein content but did not cause additive or synergistic accumulations of CYP1A1 protein when used in combination. The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD184352 inhibited ERK and EGFR activation in a concentration-dependent fashion without causing CYP1A1 mRNA accumulation. However, cotreatment with PD184352 potentiated TCDD-mediated CYP1A1 induction. TCDD-mediated induction of CYP1A1 in MCF7-TET on-EGFR cells, a MCF7 variant in which EGFR expression can be controlled, was not affected by the activity status of EGFR or ERKs. Hence, EGFR signaling mutes both basal and ligand-induced expression of two aryl hydrocarbon receptor-responsive P450s in MCF10A cultures. However, these effects are cell context-dependent. Furthermore, CYP1A1 mRNA and protein abundance are not closely coupled in MCF10A cultures.
AKR1B10 is a member of the human aldo-keto reductase superfamily which is highly expressed in several types of cancers, and has been regarded as a promising cancer therapeutic target. In this paper, a series of polyhydroxy steroids were designed and synthesized to selectively inhibit AKR1B10 activity. The most selective compound, novel compound 6, has an IC50 of 0.83±0.07μM and a selectivity of more than 120-fold for AKR1B10/AKR1B1. Structure-activity relation analyses indicate that hydroxyl at C-19 can significantly improve the selective inhibition of AKR1B10. The binding mode of AKR1B10 and its inhibitors were studied.
CYP2D6 is an important member of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme super family, with at least 100 CYP2D6 alleles being previously identified. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 significantly influence the efficacy and safety of some drugs, which might cause adverse effects and therapeutic failure. The aim of this study was to clarify the catalytic activities of 24 CYP2D6 alleles on the oxidative in vitro metabolism of methadone. Reactions were incubated with 50-2000  µM methadone for 30 min at 37 °C and terminated by cooling to -80 °C immediately. Methadone and the major metabolite EDDP were analyzed by an ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) system. Compared with wild-type CYP2D6*1, most variants showed significantly altered values in V
GNE myopathy is an autosomal recessive muscular disorder of young adults characterized by progressive skeletal muscle weakness and wasting. It is caused by a mutation in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene, which encodes a key enzyme in sialic acid biosynthesis. The mutated hypofunctional GNE is associated with intracellular accumulation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in patient muscles through as yet unknown mechanisms. We found here for the first time that an experimental reduction in sialic acid favors Aβ1-42 endocytosis in C2C12 myotubes, which is dependent on clathrin and heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Accordingly, Aβ1-42 internalization in myoblasts from a GNE myopathy patient was enhanced. Next, we investigated signal changes triggered by Aβ1-42 that may underlie toxicity. We observed that p-Akt levels are reduced in step with an increase in apoptotic markers in GNE myopathy myoblasts compared to control myoblasts. The same results were experimentally obtained when Aβ1-42 was overexpressed in myotubes. Hence, we propose a novel disease mechanism whereby hyposialylation favors Aβ1-42 internalization and the subsequent apoptosis in myotubes and in skeletal muscle from GNE myopathy patients. 
PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome refers to a spectrum of disorders caused by mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene. Cowden syndrome, the principal PTEN-related disorder is characterized by multiple neoplasms and hamartomas, mucosal papillomatosis, and skin lesions, trichilemmomas. Trichilemmomas and mucocutaneous papillomatous papules are one of the first signs of the disease. Early recognition of these skin lesions may help on diagnosing an underlying malignancy and early cancer screening. 
PRDX3 is a mitochondrial peroxide reductase that regulates cellular redox state. It has been reported that PRDX3 is overexpressed in liver cancer, but how PRDX3 is involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis and progression has not been well-characterized. In the present study, we established two stable cell lines by overexpressing or knocking down PRDX3 in HepG2 cells. We found that PRDX3 silencing decreased the growth rate of HepG2 cells and increased mtDNA oxidation. Quantitative proteomics identified 475 differentially expressed proteins between the PRDX3 knockdown and the control cells. These proteins were involved in antioxidant activity, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, cell growth, ATP synthesis, nucleic acid binding, redox, and chaperones. PRDX3 knockdown led to the down-regulation of ATP synthases and the decreased cellular ATP level, contributing to the slow-down of cell growth. Furthermore, silencing PRDX3 enhanced invasive properties of HepG2 cells via TIMP-1 down-regulation and the increased ECM degradation. Taken together, our results indicate that PRDX3 promotes HCC growth and mediates cell migration and invasiveness and is a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
SMYD3 has been implicated in a range of cancers; however, until now no potent selective small molecule inhibitors have been available for target validation studies. A novel oxindole series of SMYD3 inhibitors was identified through screening of the Epizyme proprietary histone methyltransferase-biased library. Potency optimization afforded two tool compounds, sulfonamide EPZ031686 and sulfamide EPZ030456, with cellular potency at a level sufficient to probe the in vitro biology of SMYD3 inhibition. EPZ031686 shows good bioavailability following oral dosing in mice making it a suitable tool for potential in vivo target validation studies. 
NEU3 sialidase has been shown to be a key player in many physio- and pathological processes, including cell differentiation, cellular response to hypoxic stress, and carcinogenesis. The enzyme, peculiarly localized on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, has been shown to be able to remove sialic acid residues from the gangliosides present on adjacent cells, thus creating cell to cell interactions. Nonetheless, herein we report that the enzyme localization is dynamically regulated between the plasma membrane and the endosomes, where a substantial amount of NEU3 is stored with low enzymatic activity. However, under opportune stimuli, NEU3 is shifted from the endosomes to the plasma membrane, where it greatly increases the sialidase activity. Finally, we found that NEU3 possesses also the ability to interact with specific proteins, many of which are different in each cell compartment. They were identified by mass spectrometry, and some selected ones were also confirmed by cross-immunoprecipitation with the enzyme, supporting NEU3 involvement in the cell stress response, protein folding, and intracellular trafficking. 
ABO blood group system, a well-known genetic risk factor, has clinically been demonstrated to be linked with thrombotic vascular diseases. However, the relationship between ABO blood group and coronary artery disease (CAD) is still controversial. We here performed an updated meta-analysis of the related studies and tried to elucidate the potential role of ABO blood group as a risk factor for CAD. All detectable case-control and cohort studies comparing the risk of CAD in different ABO blood groups were collected for this analysis through searching PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Ultimately, 17 studies covering 225,810 participants were included. The combined results showed that the risk of CAD was significantly higher in blood group A (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.26, p = 0.01) and lower in blood group O (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.78 to 0.94, p = 0.0008). Even when studies merely about myocardial infarction (MI) were removed, the risk of CAD was still significantly higher in blood group A (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.10, p = 0.03) and lower in blood group O (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.85 to 0.93, p < 0.00001). This updated systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that both blood group A and non-O were the risk factors of CAD.
ABCA1 exports excess cholesterol from cells to apoA-I and is essential for HDL synthesis. Genetic studies have shown that ABCA1 protects against cardiovascular disease. We have previously shown that the interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1 activates signaling molecule Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), which optimizes the cholesterol efflux activity of ABCA1. ABCA1-mediated activation of JAK2 also activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which significantly attenuates proinflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages. To determine the mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effects of apoA-I/ABCA1 interaction, we identified two special ABCA1 mutants, one with normal STAT3-activating capacity but lacking cholesterol efflux ability and the other with normal cholesterol efflux ability but lacking STAT3-activating capacity. We showed that activation of STAT3 by the interaction of apoA-I/ABCA1 without cholesterol efflux could significantly decrease proinflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages. Mechanistic studies showed that the anti-inflammatory effect of the apoA-I/ABCA1/STAT3 pathway is suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 dependent. Moreover, we showed that apoA-I/ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux without STAT3 activation can also reduce proinflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages. These findings suggest that the interaction of apoA-I/ABCA1 activates cholesterol efflux and STAT3 branch pathways to synergistically suppress inflammation in macrophages.
CYP1A1 is a potential target for anticancer drug development due to its overexpression in certain cancer cells and role in cancer progression. To identify new leads for CYP1A1 mediated anticancer action, we attempted ligand based pharmacophore mapping, virtual screening of databases, molecular docking, MetaSite based filtering, and molecular dynamics simulations. Initial computational and in vitro screening identified 11 compounds from which we identified two lead compounds, ZINC33468944 and ZINC32101539, showed potential antitumor activity on MDA-MB-435 cell lines (GI50 < 0.1 μM) and CYP1A1 inhibition of 0.13 and 0.3 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the lead compounds were evaluated for CYP1A1 mediated metabolism, showing N-hydroxylated metabolites, which have potential of DNA adduct formation and cause cancerous cell death. Analysis of molecular dynamics simulations provided important guidelines for the further modification of the lead compounds. Hence, we claim the lead molecules for further development in anticancer drug discovery.
CYP1B1 is a dioxin-inducible enzyme belonging to the cytochrome P450 superfamily. It has been observed to be important in a variety of developmental processes including in utero development of ocular structures. Owing to its role in the developmental biology of eye, its dysfunction can lead to ocular developmental defects. This has been found to be true and CYP1B1 mutations have been observed in a majority of primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) patients from all over the globe. Primary congenital glaucoma is an irreversibly blinding childhood disorder (onset at birth or early infancy) typified by anomalous development of trabecular meshwork (TM). How CYP1B1 causes PCG is not known; however, some basic investigations have been reported. Understanding the CYP1B1 mediated etiopathomechanism of PCG is very important to identify targets for therapy and preventive management. In this perspective, we will make an effort to reconstruct the pathomechanism of PCG in the light of already reported information about the disease and the CYP1B1 gene.

CD36 is a multifunctional immuno-metabolic receptor with many ligands. One of its physiological functions in the heart is the high-affinity uptake of long-chain fatty acids (FAs) from albumin and triglyceride rich lipoproteins. CD36 deletion markedly reduces myocardial FA uptake in rodents and humans. The protein is expressed on endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes and at both sites is likely to contribute to FA uptake by the myocardium. CD36 also transduces intracellular signaling events that influence how the FA is utilized and mediate metabolic effects of FA in the heart. CD36 transduced signaling regulates AMPK activation in a way that adjusts oxidation to FA uptake. It also impacts remodeling of myocardial phospholipids and eicosanoid production, effects exerted via influencing intracellular calcium (iCa(2+)) and the activation of phospholipases. Under excessive FA supply CD36 contributes to lipid accumulation, inflammation and dysfunction. However, it is also important for myocardial repair after injury via its contribution to immune cell clearance of apoptotic cells. This review describes recent progress regarding the multiple actions of CD36 in the heart and highlights those areas requiring future investigation. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Heart Lipid Metabolism edited by G.D. Lopaschuk.
CD36 is a scavenger and antiangiogenic receptor that is important in atherothrombotic diseases, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and obesity. Lysophosphatidic acid, a phospholipid signaling mediator, abolishes endothelial cell responses to antiangiogenic proteins containing thrombospondin type 1 homology domains by downregulating endothelial CD36 transcription via protein kinase D1 (PKD-1) signaling. We aimed to understand mechanisms by which lysophosphatidic acid-mediated angiogenic signaling is integrated to regulate CD36 transcription and endothelial cell function via a nuclear transcriptional complex.
DGKH is a replicated risk gene of bipolar disorder (BD). However, the pathophysiological role of the coded protein, diacylglycerol kinase eta, remains elusive.
AQP9 is known to facilitate hepatocyte glycerol uptake. Murine AQP9 protein expression has been verified in liver, skin, epididymis, epidermis and neuronal cells using knockout mice. Further expression sites have been reported in humans. We aimed to verify AQP9 expression in a large set of human normal organs, different cancer types, rheumatoid arthritis synovial biopsies as well as in cell lines and primary cells. Combining standardized immunohistochemistry with high-throughput mRNA sequencing, we found that AQP9 expression in normal tissues was limited, with high membranous expression only in hepatocytes. In cancer tissues, AQP9 expression was mainly found in hepatocellular carcinomas, suggesting no general contribution of AQP9 to carcinogenesis. AQP9 expression in a subset of rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue samples was affected by Humira, thereby supporting a suggested role of TNFα in AQP9 regulation in this disease. Among cell lines and primary cells, LP-1 myeloma cells expressed high levels of AQP9, whereas low expression was observed in a few other lymphoid cell lines. AQP9 mRNA and protein expression was absent in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Overall, AQP9 expression in human tissues appears to be more selective than in mice.
ASAH1 gene encodes for acid ceramidase that is involved in the degradation of ceramide into sphingosine and free fatty acids within lysosomes. ASAH1 variants cause both the severe and early-onset Farber disease and rare cases of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME), phenotypically characterized by childhood onset of proximal muscle weakness and atrophy due to spinal motor neuron degeneration followed by occurrence of severe and intractable myoclonic seizures and death in the teenage years. We studied two subjects, a 30-year-old pregnant woman and her 17-year-old sister, affected with a very slowly progressive non-5q SMA since childhood. No history of seizures or myoclonus has been reported and EEG was unremarkable. The molecular study of ASAH1 gene showed the presence of the homozygote nucleotide variation c.124A>G (r.124a>g) that causes the amino acid substitution p.Thr42Ala. Biochemical evaluation of cultured fibroblasts showed both reduction in ceramidase activity and accumulation of ceramide compared with the normal control. This study describes for the first time the association between ASAH1 variants and an adult SMA phenotype with no myoclonic epilepsy nor death in early age, thus expanding the phenotypic spectrum of ASAH1-related SMA. ASAH1 molecular analysis should be considered in the diagnostic testing of non-5q adult SMA patients.
ABCA3 is a lipid transporter in the limiting membrane of lamellar bodies in alveolar type II cells. Mutations in the ABCA3 gene cause respiratory distress syndrome in new-borns and childhood interstitial lung disease. ABCA3 is N-terminally cleaved by an as yet unknown protease, a process believed to regulate ABCA3 activity.
PTEN plays an important role in diabetes pathogenesis not only as a key negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway required for insulin action, but also via its role in other cell processes required to maintain metabolic homeostasis. We describe the generation of tissue-specific PTEN knockout mice and models of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which we have found useful for the study of diabetes pathogenesis. We also outline common methods suitable for the characterization of glucose homeostasis in rodent models, including techniques to measure beta cell function and insulin sensitivity.
PTEN expression can be dysregulated in cancers via multiple mechanisms including genomic loss, epigenetic silencing, transcriptional repression, and posttranscriptional regulation by microRNAs. MicroRNAs are short, noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to recognition sites on target transcripts. Recent studies have demonstrated that the competition for shared microRNAs between both protein-coding and noncoding transcripts represents an additional facet of gene regulation. Here, we describe in detail an integrated computational and experimental approach to identify and validate these competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interactions. 
PTEN subcellular localization is fundamental in the execution of the distinct PTEN biological activities, including not only its PI(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase activity when associated to membranes but also its subcellular compartment-specific interactions with regulatory and effector proteins, including those exerted in the nucleus. As a consequence, PTEN subcellular localization is tightly regulated in vivo by both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. The plasma membrane/nucleus/cytoplasm partitioning of PTEN has been the focus of several studies, both from a mechanistic and from a disease-association point of view. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on PTEN plasma membrane/nucleus/cytoplasm distribution, and present subcellular fractionation, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemical methods to study the distribution and shuttling of PTEN between these subcellular compartments. 
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) is the first tumor suppressor identified to have phosphatase activity and its gene is the second most frequently deleted or mutated tumor-suppressor gene associated with human cancers. Germline PTEN mutations are the cause of three inherited autosomal dominant disorders. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5,-triphosphate (PIP3), the product of the PI3 kinase, is one of the key intracellular targets of PTEN's phosphatase activity, although PTEN's phosphatase-independent activities have also been identified. PTEN is critical for stem cell maintenance, which contributes to its controlled tumorigenesis. PTEN loss leads the development of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that share properties with somatic stem cells, including the capacity for self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation. Methods to isolate and functionally test stem cells and CSCs are important for understanding PTEN functions and the development of therapeutic approaches to target CSCs without having adverse effects on normal stem cells. Here, we describe protocols for the isolation and functional analysis of PTEN deficient embryonic stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells and leukemia-initiating cells (LICs), neural stem cells, and prostate stem cells and CSCs.
LPL hydrolyzes triglycerides in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins along the capillaries of heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. The activity of LPL is repressed by angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Our objective was to study the cellular location and mechanism for LPL inhibition by ANGPTL4. We performed studies in transfected cells, ex vivo studies, and in vivo studies with Angptl4(-/-) mice. Cotransfection of CHO pgsA-745 cells with ANGPTL4 and LPL reduced intracellular LPL protein levels, suggesting that ANGPTL4 promotes LPL degradation. This conclusion was supported by studies of primary adipocytes and adipose tissue explants from wild-type and Angptl4(-/-) mice. Absence of ANGPTL4 resulted in accumulation of the mature-glycosylated form of LPL and increased secretion of LPL. Blocking endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi transport abolished differences in LPL abundance between wild-type and Angptl4(-/-) adipocytes, suggesting that ANGPTL4 acts upon LPL after LPL processing in the ER. Finally, physiological changes in adipose tissue ANGPTL4 expression during fasting and cold resulted in inverse changes in the amount of mature-glycosylated LPL in wild-type mice, but not Angptl4(-/-) mice. We conclude that ANGPTL4 promotes loss of intracellular LPL by stimulating LPL degradation after LPL processing in the ER.
CYP2D6 participates in the biotransformation of many commonly used drugs. Large genetic variability in CYP2D6 results in a wide interindividual variability in the response to CYP2D6 substrate drugs. Previous studies have assessed the phenotype and genotype distributions of CYP2D6 in relatively small Finnish population samples. The aim of our study was to investigate the frequencies of CYP2D6 genotypes in a larger Finnish population cohort of 857 healthy volunteers. The volunteers were genotyped for 10 CYP2D6 genetic variants (*2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *9, *10, *17, *39, *41) and copy number variation performed with TaqMan genotyping assays and copy number assay targeting exon 9. CYP2D6 phenotypes were inferred from the genotype data with the classical and activity score methods. According to the classical method, a large majority of the study cases were extensive metabolizers (EM; 87.3%; 95% confidence interval 84.9-89.3) and the second largest group was ultrarapid metabolizers (UM; 7.2%; 5.7-9.2%). Intermediate (IM) and poor metabolizers (PM) were in clear minority (3.0%; 2.1-4.4% and 2.3%; 1.5-3.6%, respectively). The activity score method yielded similar phenotype predictions. These results show that the frequency of UM genotype is higher and that of PM and IM genotype is lower in the Finnish population than in other North European populations. Accordingly, CYP2D6 genetic profile of the Finnish population differs from its geographically close neighbours, which has implications for the effective and safe use of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. 
G6PD is a housekeeping gene expressed in all cells. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is part of the pentose phosphate pathway, and its main physiologic role is to provide NADPH. G6PD deficiency, one of the commonest inherited enzyme abnormalities in humans, arises through one of many possible mutations, most of which reduce the stability of the enzyme and its level as red cells age. G6PD-deficient persons are mostly asymptomatic, but they can develop severe jaundice during the neonatal period and acute hemolytic anemia when they ingest fava beans or when they are exposed to certain infections or drugs. G6PD deficiency is a global health issue. 
CYP2D6 is a high polymorphic enzyme from P450, responsible for metabolizing almost 25% of drugs. The distribution of different mutations among CYP2D6 alleles has been associated with poor, intermediate, extensive and ultra-metabolizers.
ABO incompatibility has been considered as an important immunological barrier for renal transplantation. With the advent of effective preconditioning protocols, it is now possible to do renal transplants across ABO barrier. We hereby present a single center retrospective analysis of all consecutive ABOi renal transplants performed from November 2011 to August 2014. Preconditioning protocol consisted of rituximab, plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and maintenance immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate sodium, and prednisolone. The outcome of these ABOi transplants was compared with all other consecutive ABO-compatible (ABOc) renal transplants performed during same time. Twenty ABOi renal transplants were performed during the study period. Anti-blood group antibody titer varied from 1:2 to 1:512. Patient and graft survival was comparable between ABOi and ABOc groups. Biopsy proven acute rejection rate was 15% in ABOi group, which was similar to ABOc group (16.29%). There were no antibody-mediated rejections in ABOi group. The infection rate was also comparable. We conclude that the short-term outcome of ABOi and ABOc transplants is comparable. ABOi transplants should be promoted in developing countries to expand the donor pool. 
ADCY5 mutations have been reported as a cause of early onset hyperkinetic movements associated with delayed motor milestones, hypotonia, and exacerbation during sleep. The movement disorder may be continuous or episodic, and can vary considerably in severity within families and in individuals. The authors report a case series of 3 patients with ADCY5 mutations treated with deep brain stimulation after unsuccessful medication trials. All had extensive imaging, metabolic, and genetic testing prior to confirmation of their ADCY5 mutation. Two of the patients had the c.1252C>T; p.R418W mutation, while the youngest and most severely affected had a de novo c.2080_2088del; p.K694_M696 mutation. All had variable and incomplete, but positive responses to deep brain stimulation. The authors conclude that deep brain stimulation may provide benefit in ADCY5-related movement disorders. Long-term efficacy remains to be confirmed by longitudinal observation. ADCY5 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of early onset hyperkinetic movement disorders, and may respond to deep brain stimulation.
SMYD3 is a lysine methyltransferase overexpressed in colorectal, breast, prostate, and hepatocellular tumors, and has been implicated as an oncogene in human malignancies. Methylation of MEKK2 by SMYD3 is important for regulation of the MEK/ERK pathway, suggesting the possibility of selectively targeting SMYD3 in RAS-driven cancers. Structural and kinetic characterization of SMYD3 was undertaken leading to a co-crystal structure of SMYD3 with a MEKK2-peptide substrate bound, and the observation that SMYD3 follows a partially processive mechanism. These insights allowed for the design of GSK2807, a potent and selective, SAM-competitive inhibitor of SMYD3 (Ki = 14 nM). A high-resolution crystal structure reveals that GSK2807 bridges the gap between the SAM-binding pocket and the substrate lysine tunnel of SMYD3. Taken together, our data demonstrate that small-molecule inhibitors of SMYD3 can be designed to prevent methylation of MEKK2 and these could have potential use as anticancer therapeutics.
MTHFR is an important enzyme in the metabolism of folic acid and is crucial for reproductive function. Variation in the sequence of MTHFR has been implicated in subfertility, but definitive data are lacking. In the present study, a detailed analysis of two common MTHFR polymorphisms (c.677C>T and c.1298A>C) was performed. Additionally, for the first time, the frequencies of different MTHFR alleles were assessed in preimplantation embryos. Several striking discoveries were made. Firstly, results demonstrated that maternal MTHFR c.1298A>C genotype strongly influences the likelihood of a pregnancy occurring, with the 1298C allele being significantly overrepresented amongst women who have undergone several unsuccessful assisted reproductive treatments. Secondly, parental MTHFR genotypes were shown to affect the production of aneuploid embryos, indicating that MTHFR is one of the few known human genes with the capacity to modulate rates of chromosome abnormality. Thirdly, an unusual deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was noted for the c.677C>T polymorphism in subfertile patients, especially those who had experienced recurrent failure of embryo implantation or miscarriage, potentially explained by a rare case of heterozygote disadvantage. Finally, a dramatic impact of the MTHFR 677T allele on the capacity of chromosomally normal embryos to implant is described. Not only do these findings raise a series of interesting biological questions, but they also argue that testing of MTHFR could be of great clinical value, identifying patients at high risk of implantation failure and revealing the most viable embryos during in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles. 
SLC26A3 or Downregulated in adenoma (DRA) is the major Cl(-)/HCO3 (-) exchanger involved in electroneutral NaCl absorption in the mammalian intestine. Alterations in DRA function and expression have been implicated in diarrheal diseases associated with inflammation or infection. Therefore, agents that upregulate DRA activity may serve as potential antidiarrheals. In this regard, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a member of the bioactive sphingolipid family, has been shown to modulate various cellular processes including improvement of intestinal barrier function. However, the role of S1P in modulating intestinal chloride absorption by regulating DRA is not known. Therefore, the present studies were designed to examine the direct effects of S1P on apical Cl(-)/HCO3 (-) exchange activity and DRA expression. S1P significantly increased Cl(-)/HCO3 (-) exchange activity and also significantly increased DRA mRNA and protein expression. Increased DRA mRNA by S1P was accompanied by enhanced DRA promoter activity, indicating involvement of transcriptional mechanisms. The specific S1P receptor subtype-2 (S1PR2) antagonist JTE-013 blocked the stimulatory effects of S1P on DRA promoter activity, indicating the involvement of S1PR2 S1P-mediated increase in DRA promoter activity involved PI3K/Akt pathway. Progressive deletions of the DRA promoter indicated that the putative S1P-responsive elements are present in the -790/-398 region of the DRA promoter. Furthermore, results obtained from electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that S1P stimulated DRA promoter activity via increased binding of Ying-Yang1 (YY1) in the S1P-responsive region. In conclusion, transcriptional modulation of DRA expression and function in response to S1P through a PI3/Akt pathway represents a novel role of S1P as a potential proabsorptive agent.
ECHS1 encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the degradation of essential amino acids and fatty acids. Recently, ECHS1 mutations were shown to cause a new severe metabolic disorder presenting as Leigh or Leigh-like syndromes. The objective of this study was to describe a family with 2 siblings affected by different dystonic disorders as a resulting phenotype of ECHS1 mutations.
B4GALT1 is one of seven beta-1, 4-galactosyltransferase (B4GALT) genes, which has distinct functions in various malignances. Here, we evaluate the association of B4GALT1 expression with oncologic outcome in patients with non-metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). A retrospective analysis of 438 patients with non-metastatic ccRCC at two academic medical centers between 2005 and 2009 was performed. The first cohort with 207 patients was treated as training cohort and the other as validation cohort. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were created in triplicate from formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded specimens. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed and the association of B4GALT1 expression with standard pathologic features and prognosis were evaluated. B4GALT1 expression was significantly associated with tumor T stage (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively), Fuhrman grade (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively) and necrosis (P=0.021 and P=0.002, respectively) in both training and validation cohorts. And high B4GALT1 expression indicated poor overall survival (OS) (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively) in the two cohorts. Furthermore, B4GALT1 expression was identified as an independent adverse prognostic factor for survival (P=0.007 and P=0.002, respectively). Moreover, the accuracy of established prognostic models was improved when B4GALT1 expression was added. Therefore, a predictive nomogram was generated with identified independent prognosticators to assess patients' OS at 5 and 10 years. Increased B4GALT1 expression is a potential independent adverse prognostic factor for OS in patients with non-metastatic ccRCC. 
NME1 is a well-known metastasis suppressor which has been reported to be downregulated in some highly aggressive cancer cells. Although most studies have focused on NME1, the NME1 gene also encodes the protein (NME1L) containing N-terminal 25 extra amino acids by alternative splicing. According to previous studies, NME1L has potent anti-metastatic activity, in comparison with NME1, by interacting with IKKβ and regulating its activity. In the present study, we tried to define the role of the N-terminal 25 amino acids of NME1L in NF-κB activation signaling. Unfortunately, the sequence itself did not interact with IKKβ, suggesting that it may be not enough to constitute the functional structure. Further construction of NME1L fragments and biochemical analysis revealed that N-terminal 84 residues constitute minimal structure for homodimerization, IKKβ interaction and regulation of NF-κB signaling. The inhibitory effect of the fragment on cancer cell migration and NF-κB-stimulated gene expression was equivalent to that of whole NME1L. The data suggest that the N-terminal 84 residues may be a core region for the anti-metastatic activity of NME1L. Based on this result, further structural analysis of the binding between NME1L and IKKβ may help in understanding the anti-metastatic activity of NME1L and provide direction to NME1L and IKKβ-related anti-cancer drug design. 
GSTM1 gene deletion is one of the most known copy number polymorphisms in human genome. It is most likely caused by homologous recombination between the repeats flanking the gene. However, taking into account that the deletion has no crucial effects on human well-being, and the ability of other GSTMs to compensate for the lack of GSTM1, a role for additional factors affecting GSTM1 deletion can be proposed. Our goal was to explore the relationships between GSTM1 deletion polymorphism and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the region of the GSTM cluster that includes GSTM2, GSTM3, GSTM4, and GSTM5 in addition to GSTM1.
CYP3A5 gene polymorphism rs776746 has been associated with lower tacrolimus dose requirements and bioavailability in both adults and children. This variant causes a loss of CYP3A5 activity owing to a splice site variant leading to a truncated inactive enzyme. The aim of this study was to determine if the rs776746 gene polymorphism is related to the time to reach tacrolimus therapeutic levels in renal transplant children.
"DOT1L is the sole protein methyltransferase that methylates histone H3 on lysine 79 (H3K79), and is a promising drug target against cancers. Small-molecule inhibitors of DOT1L such as FED1 are potential anti-cancer agents and useful tools to investigate the biological roles of DOT1L in human diseases. FED1 showed excellent in vitro inhibitory activity against DOT1L, but its cellular effect was relatively poor. In this study, we designed and synthesized photo-reactive and ""clickable"" affinity-based probes (AfBPs), P1 and P2, which were cell-permeable and structural mimics of FED1. The binding and inhibitory effects of these two probes against DOT1L protein were extensively investigated in vitro and in live mammalian cells (in situ). The cellular uptake and sub-cellular localization properties of the probes were subsequently studied in live-cell imaging experiments, and our results revealed that, whereas both P1 and P2 readily entered mammalian cells, most of them were not able to reach the cell nucleus where functional DOT1L resides. This offers a plausible explanation for the poor cellular activity of FED1. Finally with P1/P2, large-scale cell-based proteome profiling, followed by quantitative LC-MS/MS, was carried out to identify potential cellular off-targets of FED1. Amongst the more than 100 candidate off-targets identified, NOP2 (a putative ribosomal RNA methyltransferase) was further confirmed to be likely a genuine off-target of FED1 by preliminary validation experiments including pull-down/Western blotting (PD/WB) and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA)."
"CYP2C19 contributes to N-desmethyl rosuvastatin formation in ""in vitro"" models. Approximately 80% of Taiwanese are CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers (EMs, CYP2C19*1/*1, *1/*2, or *1/*3). We studied the potential effect of CYP2C19 genotypes on rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy Taiwanese subjects following single and multiple daily oral doses of rosuvastatin calcium (20 mg). Geometric mean ratios for poor metabolizers (PMs): EMs for rosuvastatin were 0.974 and 0.872 for area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration on day 1 (1.01 and 0.965 on day 17) and for N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, 1.21 and 1.07 on day 1 (1.14 and 1.09 on day 17), respectively. Changes of lipid profiles from baseline to day 18 for PMs and EMs were -52.4% and -53.3% (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and -34.2% and -30.0% (total cholesterol), respectively. Rosuvastatin was generally well-tolerated by both PMs and EMs. These results suggest that CYP2C19 polymorphism does not affect rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy Taiwanese in a clinically meaningful way."
CYP3A4 expression varies up to 100-fold among individuals, and, to date, genetic causes remain elusive. As a major drug-metabolizing enzyme, elucidation of such genetic causes would increase the potential for introducing personalized dose adjustment of therapies involving CYP3A4 drug substrates. The foetal CYP3A isoform, CYP3A7, is reported to be expressed in ∼10% of European adults and may thus contribute towards the metabolism of endogenous substances and CYP3A drug substrates. However, little is known about the distribution of the variant expressed in the adult.
SLC26A4 mutations cause fluctuating and progressive hearing loss associated with enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (EVA). SLC26A4 encodes a transmembrane anion exchanger called pendrin expressed in nonsensory epithelial cells of the lateral wall of cochlea, vestibular organs and endolymphatic sac. We previously described a transgenic mouse model of EVA with doxycycline (dox)-inducible expression of Slc26a4 in which administration of dox from conception to embryonic day 17.5 (DE17.5) resulted in hearing fluctuation between 1 and 3months of age. In the present study, we hypothesized that Slc26a4 is required to stabilize hearing in DE17.5 ears between 1 and 3months of age. We tested our hypothesis by evaluating the effect of postnatal re-induction of Slc26a4 expression on hearing. Readministration of dox to DE17.5 mice at postnatal day 6 (P6), but not at 1month of age, resulted in reduced click-evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds, less fluctuation of hearing and a higher surface density of pendrin expression in spindle-shaped cells of the stria vascularis. Pendrin expression in spindle-shaped cells was inversely correlated with ABR thresholds. These findings suggest that stabilization of hearing by readministration of dox at P6 is mediated by pendrin expression in spindle-shaped cells. We conclude that early re-induction of Slc26a4 expression can prevent fluctuation of hearing in our Slc26a4-insufficient mouse model. Restoration of SLC26A4 expression and function could reduce or prevent fluctuation of hearing in EVA patients.
NAMPT may represent a novel target for drug discovery in various therapeutic areas, including oncology and inflammation. Additionally, recent work has suggested that targeting NAMPT has potential in treating axon degeneration. In this work, publicly available X-ray co-crystal structures of NAMPT and the structures of two known NAMPT inhibitors were used as the basis for a structure- and ligand-based virtual screening campaign. From this, two novel series of NAMPT inhibitors were identified, one of which showed a statistically significant protective effect when tested in a cellular model of axon degeneration.
AKR1C3 is a critical enzyme for producing testosterone and 5α-DHT in the human body. Inhibiting AKR1C3 is a potential target for treating castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). To find AKR1C3 inhibitors with a new molecular skeleton and binding mode, we analyzed the in vitro inhibitory activity of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and eight other phenolic acid analogues towards AKR1C3 and six other human AKR1 enzymes. We analyzed CAPE and octyl gallate interactions with AKR1C3 using X-ray crystallography, which provided a molecular basis for understanding the phenolic acid inhibitory activity and selectivity towards human AKR1s. 
PTEN protein is an important tumour suppressor factor detectable by immunohistochemistry. The goal of the present study was to investigate the prognostic role of PTEN gene expression focusing on length of survival in breast cancer patients. This descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 100 breast cancer cases referred to Sabzevar hospitals in the north east of Iran between 2010 and 2011, followed up to 2015. The PTEN gene expression of tumour tissue samples was determined using specific monoclonal antibodies. The data were analyzed using Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. Patient length of survival was analyzed after 4 years of follow-up using the Cox regression model. The PTEN gene was expressed in 70 of 100 samples, while being found at a high level in all noncancerous samples. There was an inverse significant relationship between expression of PTEN and tumour stage and grade (p<0.001). In addition, expression of PTEN in invasive ductal tumours was less than in non-invasive tumours. There was also an inverse significant relationship between the likelihood of death and PTEN gene expression (p<0.01). These findings indicate that lack of PTEN gene expression can be sign for a poor prognosis in breast cancer.
PTEN loss is a promising prognostic and predictive biomarker in prostate cancer. Because it occurs most commonly via PTEN gene deletion, we developed a clinical-grade, automated, and inexpensive immunohistochemical assay to detect PTEN loss. We studied the sensitivity and specificity of PTEN immunohistochemistry relative to four-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for detection of PTEN gene deletion in a multi-institutional cohort of 731 primary prostate tumors. Intact PTEN immunostaining was 91% specific for the absence of PTEN gene deletion (549/602 tumors with two copies of the PTEN gene by FISH showed intact expression of PTEN by immunohistochemistry) and 97% sensitive for the presence of homozygous PTEN gene deletion (absent PTEN protein expression by immunohistochemistry in 65/67 tumors with homozygous deletion). PTEN immunohistochemistry was 65% sensitive for the presence of hemizygous PTEN gene deletion, with protein loss in 40/62 hemizygous tumors. We reviewed the 53 cases where immunohistochemistry showed PTEN protein loss and FISH showed two intact copies of the PTEN gene. On re-review, there was ambiguous immunohistochemistry loss in 6% (3/53) and failure to analyze the same tumor area by both methods in 34% (18/53). Of the remaining discordant cases, 41% (13/32) revealed hemizygous (n=8) or homozygous (n=5) PTEN gene deletion that was focal in most cases (11/13). The remaining 19 cases had two copies of the PTEN gene detected by FISH, representing truly discordant cases. Our automated PTEN immunohistochemistry assay is a sensitive method for detection of homozygous PTEN gene deletions. Immunohistochemistry screening is particularly useful to identify cases with heterogeneous PTEN gene deletion in a subset of tumor glands. Mutations, small insertions, or deletions and/or epigenetic or microRNA-mediated mechanisms may lead to PTEN protein loss in tumors with normal or hemizygous PTEN gene copy number.
MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), although the results of previous studies have been inconsistent. The aim of this study was to explore whether these polymorphisms play a role in the genetic susceptibility to MI. A comprehensive search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was conducted for studies evaluating the association between the C667T and A1298C polymorphisms and MI risk. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of association in the dominant model, recessive model, allelic model, and genotypes contrast. A total of 47 studies were finally included in this meta-analysis. Overall, the results showed no statistically significant association between C667T and A1298C polymorphisms and MI risk. However, in subgroup analysis by ethnicity, the T allele of C677T polymorphism was associated with a 63% increased risk of MI compared with the C allele (T vs. C, OR=1. 63, 95%CI=1.15-2.10, fixed effects) in African populations, while compared to wild homozygote genotype, CT genotype was associated with a decreased risk of MI in North American populations (CT vs. CC, OR=0.81, 95%CI=0.64-0.98, fixed effects). Moreover, C677T polymorphism had a protective effect against MI risk under the dominant model (OR=0.93, 945%CI=0.87-0.99, fixed effects) in elderly (≥50) population. The A1298C polymorphism was not significantly associated with MI risk. Unlike A1298C polymorphism, C677T polymorphism was associated with risk of MI in African, North American, and elderly populations. 
PFKFB4 is reported to regulate glycolysis by synthesizing fructose-2, 6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP) and has proved to be associated with most malignancies. However, the underlying mechanism for increased PFKFB4 expression in bladder cancer remains unclear. The present study demonstrated that PFKFB4 was overexpressed in bladder cancer tissues. In addition, the expression of PFKFB4 elevated in bladder cancer cells in the hypoxic condition, while in nomoxic condition, the expression of PFKFB4 still very low. Furthermore, we identified the hypoxia-responsive elements (HRE)-D from five putative HREs in the promoter region of PFKFB4 and demonstrated that the HRE-D was transactivated by the HIF-1α in bladder cancer cells. By using the Double-immunofluorescence co-localization assay, we revealed that the HIF-1α expression was associated with PFKFB4 expression in human bladder cancer specimens. Altogether, our study for the first time identified the pivotal role of HIF-1α in the connection between PFKFB4 and hypoxia in bladder cancer, which may prove to be a potential target for the treatment of bladder cancer.
"ABCG2 is a multidrug transporter with wide substrate specificity, and is believed to protect several cell types from various xenobiotics and endobiotics. This ""guardian"" function is important in numerous cell types and tissue barriers but becomes disadvantageous by being responsible for the multidrug resistance phenotype in certain tumor cells. ABCG2 regulation at the protein level has already been extensively studied, however, regulation at the mRNA level, especially the functional role of the various 5' untranslated exon variants (5' UTRs) has been elusive. In the present work, we describe a comprehensive characterization of four ABCG2 mRNA variants with different exon 1 sequences, investigate drug inducibility, stem cell specificity, mRNA stability, and translation efficiency. Although certain variants (E1B and E1C) are considered as ""constitutive"" mRNA isoforms, we show that chemotoxic drugs significantly alter the expression pattern of distinct ABCG2 mRNA isoforms. When examining human embryonic stem cell lines, we provide evidence that variant E1A has an expression pattern coupled to undifferentiated stem cell stage, as its transcript level is regulated parallel to mRNAs of Oct4 and Nanog pluripotency marker genes. When characterizing the four exon 1 variants we found no significant differences in terms of mRNA stabilities and half-lives of the isoforms. In contrast, variant E1U showed markedly lower translation efficiency both at the total protein level or regarding the functional presence in the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results indicate that the different 5' UTR variants play an important role in cell type specific regulation and fine tuning of ABCG2 expression. "
SLC1A4 deficiency is a recently described neurodevelopmental disorder associated with microcephaly, global developmental delay, abnormal myelination, thin corpus callosum and seizures. It has been mainly reported in the Ashkenazi-Jewish population with affected individuals homozygous for the p.Glu256Lys variant. Exome sequencing performed in an Irish proband identified a novel homozygous nonsense SLC1A4 variant [p.Trp453*], confirming a second case of SLC1A4-associated infantile spasms. As this is the first European identified, population ancestry analysis of the Exome Aggregation Consortium database was performed to determine the wider ethnic background of SLC1A4 deficiency carriers. p.Glu256Lys was found in Hispanic and South Asian populations. Other potential disease-causing variants were also identified. Investigation for SLC1A4 deficiency should be performed regardless of ethnicity and extend to include unexplained early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. 
CYP2C19 is an important member of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme super family and is responsible for clearing approximately 10% of commonly used clinical drugs that undergo phase I metabolism. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C19 significantly influence the efficacy and safety of some drugs, which might cause undesirable adverse effects or cure failure at standard dosages. The aim of this study was to clarify the catalytic activities of 31 CYP2C19 alleles on the oxidative in vitro metabolism of methadone. Insect microsomes expressing the CYP2C19 alleles were incubated with 50-2000 μM methadone for 30 min at 37 °C and terminated by cooling to -80 °C immediately. Methadone and its metabolite EDDP were analyzed by an ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) system. Of the 31 tested CYP2C19 allelies variants, CYP2C19*1 is the wild-type. Compared with CYP2C19*1, two CYP2C19 variants (CYP2C19*3 and *35FS) had no detectable enzyme activity, one variant L16F exhibited slightly increased intrinsic clearance values, and one variant N277K showed no significant difference. In addition, 26 variants exhibited significantly decreased values (from 1.48% to 80.40%). These findings suggest that more attention should be paid in clinical administration of methadone to individuals carrying these CYP2C19 alleles. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
SLC4A3 has been shown to cause retinal degeneration in a genetically engineered knockout mouse, and in a naturally occurring form of canine progressive retinal atrophy considered to be the equivalent of retinitis pigmentosa in humans (RP). This study was undertaken to investigate if SLC4A3 coding variants were implicated in human retinal degeneration. SLC4A3 exons were amplified and sequenced in 200 patients with autosomal recessive retinal degeneration who had no known molecular diagnosis for their condition, which included 197 unrelated individuals with suspected RP and three individuals with other forms of retinal disease. Three rare variants were identified that were predicted to be potentially pathogenic, however each variant was heterozygous in a single patient and therefore not considered disease-causing in isolation. Of these three variants, SNP-3 was the rarest, with an allele frequency of 7.06 x 10(-5) (>46,000 exomes from the ExAC database). In conclusion, no compound heterozygous or homozygous potentially pathogenic variants were identified that would account for recessive RP or retinal degeneration in this cohort, however the possibility remains that the rare variants identified could be acting with as yet undiscovered mutations in introns or regulatory regions. SLC4A3 remains an excellent candidate gene for human retinal degeneration, and with the advent of whole exome and whole genome sequencing of cohorts of molecularly unsolved patients with syndromic and non-syndromic forms of retinal degeneration, SLC4A3 may yet be implicated in human disease.
ECHS1 is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that catalyzes an important step in the β-oxidation spiral of fatty acid catabolism, and individuals with mutations in the ECHS1 gene suffer from an autosomal recessive condition typified by delayed psychomotor development, mitochondrial encephalopathy, hypotonia, and cardiomyopathy. Here we report the first Arab case of ECHS1 Deficiency. The patient was born to consanguineous parents with all growth parameters being low for gestational age, and was persistently desaturated. Cord blood gas and later blood analysis showed severe metabolic acidosis. Tandem MS revealed increased levels of valine, and Leucine/Isoleucine and decreased level of Glutamine. There was also a large patent ductus arteriosus with right to left shunt and a possible small muscular ventricular septal defect. Whole Exome Sequencing revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation in the ECHS1 gene; c.842 A > G (p.Glu281Gly). In-silico analysis suggests that the residue affected by this mutation may be involved in an important functional or structural role.
ALDH2 is involved in the metabolism of styrene, a widely used industrial material, but no data are available regarding the influence of this enzyme on the metabolic fate as well as toxic effects of this chemical. In this study, we recruited 329 workers occupationally exposed to styrene and 152 unexposed controls. DNA strand breaks, DNA-base oxidation in leukocytes and urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) were assayed as biomarkers to measure genotoxic effects. Meanwhile, we examined the genetic polymorphisms, including ALDH2, EXPH1, GSTM1, GSTT1 and CYP2E1, and also analyzed the levels of styrene exposure through detecting urinary styrene metabolites and styrene concentration in air. In terms of DNA damage, the three genotoxic biomarkers were significantly increased in exposed workers as compared with controls. And the styrene-exposed workers with inactive ALDH2 *2 allele were subjected to genotoxicity in a higher degree than those with ALDH2 *1/*1 genotype. Also, lower levels of urinary styrene metabolites (MA + PGA) were observed in styrene-exposed workers carrying ALDH2 *2 allele, suggesting slower metabolism of styrene. The polymorphisms of other enzymes showed less effect. These results suggested that styrene metabolism and styrene-induced genotoxicity could be particularly modified by ALDH2 polymorphisms. The important role of ALDH2 indicated that the accumulation of styrene glycoaldehyde, a possible genotoxic intermediate of styrene, could account for the genotoxicity observed, and should be taken as an increased risk of cancer.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor that functions to negatively regulate the PI3K/AKT pathway as the lipid phosphatase for phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. Phosphorylation of a cluster of Ser/Thr residues (amino acids 380-385) on the C-terminal tail serves to alter the conformational state of PTEN from an open active state to a closed inhibited state, resulting in a reduction of plasma membrane localization and inhibition of enzyme activity. The relative contribution of each phosphorylation site to PTEN autoinhibition and the structural basis for the conformational closure is still unclear. To further the structural understanding of PTEN regulation by C-terminal tail phosphorylation, we used protein semisynthesis to insert stoichiometric and site-specific phospho-Ser/Thr(s) in the C-terminal tail of PTEN. Additionally, we employed photo-cross-linking to map the intramolecular PTEN interactions of the phospho-tail. Systematic evaluation of the PTEN C-tail phospho-cluster showed autoinhibition, and conformational closure was influenced by the aggregate effect of multiple phospho-sites rather than dominated by a single phosphorylation site. Moreover, photo-cross-linking suggested a direct interaction between the PTEN C-tail and a segment in the N-terminal region of the catalytic domain. Mutagenesis experiments provided additional insights into how the PTEN phospho-tail interacts with both the C2 and catalytic domains.
NAMPT has been suggested association with atherosclerosis and insulin resistance. However, the impact of NAMPT on atherosclerosis remained unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use a NAMPT loss-of-function approach to investigate the effect of NAMPT on atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic mice. We demonstrated that a specific NAMPT knockdown increased plasma HDL-C levels, reduced the plaque area of the total aorta en face and the cross-sectional aortic sinus, decreased macrophage number and apoptosis, and promoted RCT in HFD-fed ApoE KO mice. These changes were accompanied by increased PPARα, LXRα, ABCA1 and ABCG1 expressions in the liver. NAMPT knockdown also facilitated cholesterol efflux in RAW264.7 cells. We further investigated the effect of NAMPT knockdown on the PPARα-LXRα pathway of cholesterol metabolism with MK886 (a selective inhibitor of PPARα) in RAW264.7 macrophages. MK886 abolished the ability of NAMPT knockdown to decrease intracellular cholesterol levels to enhance the rate of (3)H-cholesterol efflux and to increase ABCA1/G1 and LXRα expressions in RAW264.7 macrophages. Our observations demonstrate that NAMPT knockdown exerted antiatherogenic effects by promoting cholesterol efflux and macrophage RCT through the PPARα- LXRα- ABCA1/G1pathway in vitro and in vivo.
LPL is a pivotal rate-limiting enzyme to catalyze the hydrolysis of TG in circulation, and plays a critical role in regulating lipid metabolism. However, little attention has been paid to LPL in the adult liver due to its relatively low expression. Here we show that endogenous hepatic LPL plays an important physiological role in plasma lipid homeostasis in adult mice. We generated a mouse model with the Lpl gene specifically ablated in hepatocytes with the Cre/LoxP approach, and found that specific deletion of hepatic Lpl resulted in a significant decrease in plasma LPL contents and activity. As a result, the postprandial TG clearance was markedly impaired, and plasma TG and cholesterol levels were significantly elevated. However, deficiency of hepatic Lpl did not change the liver TG and cholesterol contents or glucose homeostasis. Taken together, our study reveals that hepatic LPL is involved in the regulation of plasma LPL activity and lipid homeostasis.
BCAT1 initiates the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids. Here, we investigated the function of BCAT1 and its transcriptional regulatory mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
CYP2C8 is involved in the metabolic clearance of several important drugs and recent reports have shown that acyl glucuronides of gemfibrozil and clopidogrel are potent time-dependent inhibitors of CYP2C8 activity. In the present study, the inhibitory effect of steviol acyl glucuronide (SVAG), a circulating metabolite formed after the ingestion of rebaudioside A, was investigated using in vitro and in vivo systems. Results indicated that SVAG was a reversible but not a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP2C8-mediated paclitaxel 6α-hydroxylation. SVAG was also capable of inhibiting CYP2C8-mediated repaglinide 3'-hydroxylation in human liver microsomes and recombinant human CYP2C8, with Ki values of 15.8 μM and 11.6 μM, respectively. In contrast, SVAG did not exhibit inhibitory effect on CYP2C8 activity in rat liver microsomes. In addition, co-administration of rebaudioside A with repaglinide in rats did not lead to AUC and Cmax changes of repaglinide. Although mathematic prediction using a simplified mechanistic model revealed a moderate interaction potential between repaglinide and SVAG, cautions should be given to patients with hypoglycemia if repaglinide and rebaudioside A are used in combination for the blood sugar control. 
BSG is composed of two major fractions with different molecular weight: PER-BSG (5980kgmol(-1)) and SUPER-BSG (1045kgmol(-1)). In the present work, the emulsifying and foaming properties of BSG and its fractions were investigated as a function of molecular weight, chain flexibility and physicochemical features (protein and acid uronic content). BSG prevented creaming of emulsion for 4 weeks. This high stabilization may be related to formation a solid-like structure and viscoelastic film of BSG around oil droplets which protected oil droplets against aggregation. The low molecular weight fraction (SUPER-BSG) created more stable emulsion than high molecular weight fraction (PER-BSG). The foam capacity and stability of albumin solution increased by adding BSG. The highest foam stability was observed at the highest gum concentration (0.3% w/v). Removing protein moieties of BSG led to emulsion and foam stabilization properties of BSG weakened, which presents the importance of protein in emulsifying and foaming properties of BSG. 
ABO incompatibility is not a contraindication for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, but this procedure requires an extra effort for erythrocyte or plasma depletion in certain well established conditions. Some acute or delayed immunohematological complications such as acute or chronic hemolysis and pure red cell aplasia may be encountered. In this study the outcome and transplant related complications of ABO incompatible and identical cases, who have received allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells from their HLA identical siblings were compared with each other. Ninety-one patients (CML 36, AML 37, other 18) were analyzed retrospectively including 51 (60.4%) ABO identical patients and 36 (39.6%) ABO mismatched (MM) patients, who have a bi-directional MM (n= 5), major MM (n= 16), minor MM (n= 9) and Rh MM (n= 6). Median follow up was 13 (0.5-43.0) months. We did not observed any significant differences between two groups (identical vs non-identical) in terms of acute hemolysis preceding stem cell infusion, peritransplant transfusion demand, acute- and chronic graft versus host disease. There was no change in estimated disease free survival and overall survival durations. We did not observed any influence of ABO/Rh incompatibility on short term outcome in allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in our series and did not recommend further manipulation of the infused stem cells. 
ABCC11 is reported to be associated with breast cancer. However, whether ABCC11 polymorphisms relate to breast cancer risk remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate any association of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs17822931, in ABCC11 with breast cancer in Koreans. Genomic DNA samples of 170 women with breast cancer and 100 controls were assessed for SNP rs17822931 of ABCC11 by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing. A 27-bp deletion (Δ27) of ABCC11 was analyzed by PCR amplification. The genotype of SNP rs17822931 was confirmed to be AA in all samples from breast cancer patients and Δ27 was found in none of the samples. Our finding indicated that the SNP rs17822931 in ABCC11 is not associated with breast cancer. However, this study does provide information on fundamental genetic aspects of ABCC11 with regard to breast cancer risk in Koreans. 
ABCB1 (or P-glycoprotein) is implicated in the multidrug-resistance phenotype, including the resistance toward anticancer drugs such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vitro the influence of the ABCB1 1199G>A SNP on ABCB1 transport activity toward selected TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib) that are currently used in chronic myelogenous leukemia.
MTHFR gene polymorphisms has been shown to be associated with methotrexate (MTX) toxicity in adult hematological malignancies; however, the results remain inconclusive.
IDH1 mutated glioblastoma (GB) has a better prognosis than IDH1 wildtype GB. However, it remains unknown whether patients (pts) with IDH1 mutated GB have a higher 6-month progression free survival (PFS6) or radiographic response (RR) rate on clinical trials for recurrence. Retrospective review of GB pts at MDACC between 2006 and 2012 identified 330 patients in recurrent GB trials. 93 patients (28 %) had either PFS6 or a complete/partial RR per RANO criteria. 49/93 (53 %) patients with PFS6 or a complete/partial RR had tumor tissue for IDH1 testing. A matched cohort of 49 patients on recurrent GB clinical trials that failed to achieve PFS6 or RR (also with tissue for IDH1 testing) was identified for comparison. IDH1 status was obtained in 92/98 (94 %) patients of which 17 (18 %) had an IDH1 mutation. PFS6 was seen in 26/49 (53 %) patients. IDH status was unknown in two of these patients. 5/24 (21 %) were IDH1 mutated compared to 5/24 (21 %) of their matched cohort without PFS6. RR was found in 47/49 (94 %) patients. IDH status was unknown in four of these patients. IDH1 mutation was present in 7/43 (16 %) patients with RR compared to 10/43 (23 %) in the matched cohort without RR (p = 0.48). Median OS for trials at first recurrence was 9.8 months for IDH1 wildtype GB vs. 19.32 months for IDH1 mutated GB (p = 0.14). IDH1 mutation status was not predictive of PFS6 or RR in recurrent GB trials for this data set. However, further examination in larger randomized prospective studies is needed.
IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) mutation might be encounter in the low grade glioma and directs the progression of the tumor to a higher grade.
CFTR is an apical membrane anion channel that regulates fluid homeostasis in many organs including the airways, colon, pancreas and sweat glands. In cystic fibrosis, CFTR dysfunction causes significant morbidity/mortality. Whilst CFTR's function as an ion channel has been well described, its ability to regulate other proteins is less understood. We have previously shown that plasma membrane CFTR increases the surface density of the adenosine 2B receptor (A2BR), but not of the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR), leading to an enhanced, adenosine-induced cAMP response in the presence of CFTR. In this study, we have found that the C-terminal PDZ-domain of both A2BR and CFTR were crucial for this interaction, and that replacing the C-terminus of A2BR with that of β2AR removed this CFTR-dependency. This observation extended to intact epithelia and disruption of the actin cytoskeleton prevented A2BR-induced but not β2AR-induced airway surface liquid (ASL) secretion. We also found that CFTR expression altered the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and PDZ-binding proteins in both HEK293T cells and in well-differentiated human bronchial epithelia. Furthermore, removal of CFTR's PDZ binding motif (ΔTRL) prevented actin rearrangement, suggesting that CFTR insertion in the plasma membrane results in local reorganization of actin, PDZ binding proteins and certain GPCRs.
ABCG2 is one of at least three human ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters which can facilitate the export from cells of a wide range of chemically unrelated drug molecules. This capacity for multidrug transport is not only a confounding factor in chemotherapy, but is also one of the more perplexing phenomena in transporter biochemistry. Since its discovery in the last decade of the 20th century much has been revealed about ABCG2's localization, physiological function and its broad substrate range. There have also been many investigations of its structure and molecular mechanism. In this mini review article we take a Rumsfeldian approach to ABCG2 and essentially ask what we do know about this transporter, and what we will need to know about this transporter if we wish to use modulation of ABCG2 activity as a therapeutic approach.
CYP2C9 is one of the most important phase I drug-metabolizing enzymes in liver. The objective of this work was to investigate the effects of apigenin on the metabolism of losartan and human CYP2C9 and rat CYP2C11 activity in vitro.
CYP2B6 polymorphisms contribute to inter-individual variations in pharmacokinetics of methadone. Increased pain sensitivity is frequently reported by opioid dependent patients on methadone maintenance therapy (MMT). It is possible, therefore, that genetic polymorphisms in CYP2B6, which affects the metabolism of methadone, influence pain sensitivity among patients on MMT. This study investigated CYP2B6 polymorphisms and pain sensitivity in this group.
ABCG2 is a multidrug resistance efflux pump expressed in many diverse tumors. The overexpression of ABCG2 is associated with resistance to a wide variety of anticancer agents, providing a noticeable setback to successful cancer therapy. Therapies targeting ABCG2 may therefore be a promising candidate for reversal of chemoresistance. The anti-ABCG2 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody was constructed by phage display peptide library technology. Immunoblotting, ELISA and immunocytochemistry were used to evaluate the soluble expression and immunoreactivity of the scFv. The effects of scFv on cell function and chemosensitization were confirmed by colony formation, cell migration and CCK-8 assays. Flow cytometry was used to analyse the cell cycle and apoptosis. Radioimmunoimaging and nude mouse tumorigenicity assays were taken to determine the biodistribution and antitumor capacity of the scFv antibody. We have successfully screened out the candidate scFv antibody with an apparent molecular weight of 34 kDa. The scFv demonstrated favourable binding ability to lung adenocarcinoma cells and ABCG2 antigen, and the radioactivity was specifically aggregated at the tumor location. Furthermore, the internalized scFv resulted in antibody-mediated downregulation of ABCG2, proliferation inhibition, apoptosis and cisplatin (DDP) sensitivity. The anti-ABCG2 scFv antibody possesses good tumoraffin and antitumor activity and may therefore be an effective therapeutic agent for lung adenocarcinoma that is dependent on ABCG2 for drug resistance and survival. 
PTEN is a lipid phosphatase that converts phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-phosphate (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-phosphate (PIP2) and plays a critical role in the regulation of tumor growth. PTEN is subject to regulation by a variety of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation on a C-terminal cluster of four Ser/Thr residues (380, 382, 383, and 385) and ubiquitylation by various E3 ligases, including NEDD4-1 and WWP2. It has previously been shown that C-terminal phosphorylation of PTEN can increase its cellular half-life. Using in vitro ubiquitin transfer assays, we show that WWP2 is more active than NEDD4-1 in ubiquitylating unphosphorylated PTEN. The mapping of ubiquitylation sites in PTEN by mass spectrometry showed that both NEDD4-1 and WWP2 can target a broad range of Lys residues in PTEN, although NEDD4-1 versus WWP2 showed a stronger preference for ubiquitylating PTEN's C2 domain. Whereas tetraphosphorylation of PTEN did not significantly affect its ubiquitylation by NEDD4-1, it inhibited PTEN ubiquitylation by WWP2. Single-turnover and pull-down experiments suggested that tetraphosphorylation of PTEN appears to weaken its interaction with WWP2. These studies reveal how the PTEN E3 ligases WWP2 and NEDD4-1 exhibit distinctive properties in Lys selectivity and sensitivity to PTEN phosphorylation. Our findings also provide a molecular mechanism for the connection between PTEN Ser/Thr phosphorylation and PTEN's cellular stability.
PTEN is a critical tumor suppressor whose dysregulation leads to metabolic disease and cancer. How these diseases are linked at a molecular level is poorly understood. Maf1 is a novel PTEN target that connects PTEN's ability to repress intracellular lipid accumulation with its tumor suppressor function. Maf1 represses the expression of rRNAs and tRNAs to restrain biosynthetic capacity and oncogenic transformation. Recent studies demonstrate that Maf1 also controls intracellular lipid accumulation. In animal models, dysregulation of RNA polymerase I- and III-dependent transcription, and subsequent upregulation of rRNAs and tRNAs, leads to altered lipid metabolism and storage. Together these results identify unexpected connections between RNA and lipid metabolism that may help explain the strong epidemiological association between obesity and cancer.
PIK3CA gene was found in generation of p110 alpha (p110α) protein through an instruction process. p110 alpha acts as a catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) proceed phosphorylation of signal molecules through PI3K pathway. This PI3K involved in regulation of cellular growth, transformation, adhesion, apoptosis, survival and motility. In some situations the PI3K/Akt pathway get altered due to mutation in PIK3CA gene produced oncogenic event in human malignancy.
ABO blood type is associated with cardiovascular disease, although the underlying mechanisms are presumed to be complex. While the relationship between non-O blood types and von Willebrand Factor (vWF) is well-established, associations with cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) across diverse populations are understudied.
CYP1B1 is a promising drug target for developing novel drugs against hormonal cancers and hypertension. The development of CYP1B1-specific inhibitors is hindered mainly due to non-specific action of known CYP inhibitors. The active site of CYP1B1 is similar to other cytochromes with different substrate preferences rendering a scope to develop specific inhibitors. We have developed a novel in silico approach for design of selective CYP1B1 inhibitors. The approach consists of deriving details of CYP1B1-specific molecular interactions from prior studies, which is used to perform screening of CYP1B1 with NCI compounds. The conventional compound screening is also complemented with the concept of cutoff distance between heme (Fe) and compounds. The binding free energies and HB percentage occupancy calculations of 94 compounds of cluster 1 have verified the docking results using MD. The docking interactions in the active-site cavity of 7 clusters are also taken into account for optimal binding. Hence, we used knowledgebase filtering and MD simulations to enable discovery of selective CYP1B1 inhibitors. The final filtered lead candidates consist of compounds sandwiched between phenylalanine π-π stacking and less than 6 Å from heme (Fe) for enzymatic action. The findings in the study can help development of novel CYP1B1 selective inhibitors.
CD36 transmembrane proteins have diverse roles in lipid uptake, cell adhesion and pathogen sensing. Despite numerous in vitro studies, how they act in native cellular contexts is poorly understood. A Drosophila CD36 homologue, sensory neuron membrane protein 1 (SNMP1), was previously shown to facilitate detection of lipid-derived pheromones by their cognate receptors in olfactory cilia. Here we investigate how SNMP1 functions in vivo. Structure-activity dissection demonstrates that SNMP1's ectodomain is essential, but intracellular and transmembrane domains dispensable, for cilia localization and pheromone-evoked responses. SNMP1 can be substituted by mammalian CD36, whose ectodomain can interact with insect pheromones. Homology modelling, using the mammalian LIMP-2 structure as template, reveals a putative tunnel in the SNMP1 ectodomain that is sufficiently large to accommodate pheromone molecules. Amino-acid substitutions predicted to block this tunnel diminish pheromone sensitivity. We propose a model in which SNMP1 funnels hydrophobic pheromones from the extracellular fluid to integral membrane receptors.
PIK3R1 (encoding the p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) is the 11th most frequently mutated gene across tumors. We recently reported neomorphic p85α mutants that induce signaling cascades not predicted by the canonical functions of p85α, suggesting the need to functionally annotate specific mutations in cancer genes for effective genome-informed personalized therapy. 
NAMPT is a novel therapeutic target of ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a potential NAMPT activator, P7C3-A20, an aminopropyl carbazole derivative, on ischemic stroke.
CYP3A5 (cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 5) expression stimulates the sodium retentive actions of the mineralocorticoid receptor causative of hypertension, probably by means of its ability to substantially increase the level of 6β-hydroxylase activity. Most Black individuals are functional CYP3A5 expressers, and this is a candidate gene for the high incidence of hypertension in Black populations. The study investigates whether CYP3A5 expression results in higher blood pressure in a Ghanaian population. Real-time PCR was used to genotype 898 DNA samples for the CYP3A5*3 and CYP3A5*6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with technically adequate genotyping for 881 samples. Of these, 803 were genetic CYP3A5 expressers, 44 nonexpressers and 34 uncertain (CYP3A5*3/*6). Although there was a trend in the proportion of hypertensive individuals as CYP3A5 expression decreased, using a two-sided t-test, no statistically significant relationship was established between systolic or diastolic pressure and CYP3A5*3 or CYP3A5*6 genotypes, or their haplotypes (Systolic confidence interval: -8.44 to -7.70, P=0.93, Diastolic confidence interval: -4.89 to 4.85, P=0.99). We conclude, therefore, that there is either no association between CYP3A5 expression and blood pressure or, if there is a relationship, the strength of the association is very small.
CD36 is a transmembrane glycoprotein, a multi-ligand receptor, possesses various biological functions. CD36 deficiency may stimulate the body to produce anti-CD36 alloimmune antibodies through the several pathways, such as blood transfusion, pregnancy or organ transplantation and so on, leading to the refractoriness of immune platelet transfusion and other diseases. The recent research advances of CD36 deficiency and its molecular biological basis, platelet transfusion and CD36 antibody detection are summarized briefey in this review. 
INPP4B has been recently shown to be a poor prognostic marker and confer chemo- or radio-resistance in AML cells, whereas, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we aimed to explore the possible mechanisms mediated the resistance to chemotherapy in AML. We found that INPP4B-mediated resistance to genotoxic drug, cytarabine, was accompanied by lower p-H2AX accumulation in KG-1 cells, and INPP4B knockdown evidently sensitized KG-1 cells to cytarabine, meanwhile, p-H2AX expression was increased dramatically. Then, we observed that INPP4B knockdown inhibited the loss of p-H2AX expression after cytarabine removal in INPP4B-silenced KG-1 cells, whereas, in control KG-1 cells, the expression of p-H2AX was reduced in a time-dependent manner. Next, INPP4B knockdown can significantly downregulate ATM expression and subsequently inhibit the activation of ATM downstream targets of p-ATM, p-BRCA1, p-ATR, and p-RAD51. Furthermore, nuclear localization of p65 was inhibited after INPP4B knockdown, and reactivation of p65 can rescue the INPP4B knockdown-induced inhibition of ATM, p-ATM, p-BRCA1, p-ATR, and p-RAD51. Finally, INPP4B expression was positively correlated with ATM expression in AML cells, both INPP4B knockdown and KU55933 can significantly sensitize primary myeloid leukemic cells to cytarabine treatment.Collectively, these data suggest that enhanced ATM-dependent DNA repair is involved in resistance to chemotherapy in INPP4B
ABCA3 is a surfactant lipid transporter in the limiting membrane of lamellar bodies in alveolar type II cells. Mutations in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A (ABC1), member 3 (ABCA3) gene cause respiratory distress syndrome in newborns, and chronic interstitial lung disease in children and adults. ABCA3 belongs to the class of full ABC transporters, which are supposed to be functional in their monomeric forms. Although other family members e.g., ABCA1 and ABCC7 have been shown to function as oligomers, the oligomerization state of ABCA3 is unknown. In the present study, the oligomerization of ABCA3 was investigated in cell lysates and crude membrane preparations from transiently and stably transfected 293 cells using blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE), gel filtration and co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally, homooligomerization was examined in vivo in cells using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Using BN-PAGE and gel filtration, we demonstrate that non-denatured ABCA3 exists in different oligomeric forms, with monomers (45%) and tetramers (30%) being the most abundant forms. Furthermore, we also show the existence of 20% dimers and 5% trimers. BRET analyses verified intermolecular interactions in vivo. Our results also demonstrated that the arrest of ABCA3 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), either through drug treatment or induced by mutations in ABCA3, inhibited the propensity of the protein to form dimers. Based on our results, we suggest that transporter oligomerization is crucial for ABCA3 function and that a disruption of oligomerization due to mutations represents a novel pathomechanism in ABCA3-associated lung disease. 
PTEN acts as a phosphatase for PIP3 and negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT pathway, and p27(KIP1) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that regulates the G1 to S-phase transition by binding to and regulating the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases. Genetic alterations of PTEN or CDKN1B (p27(KIP1)) are common in hematological malignancies. To better understand how mutations in these two genes might cooperate in leukemogenesis, we inactivated both genes in the hematological compartment in mice. Here, we show that the combined inactivation of Pten and Cdkn1b results in a more severe myeloproliferative neoplasm phenotype associated with lower hemoglobin, enlarged spleen and liver, and shorter lifespan compared to inactivation of Pten alone. More severe anemia and increased myeloid infiltration and destruction of the spleen contributed to the earlier death of these mice, and elevated p-AKT, cyclin D1, and cyclin D3 might contribute to the development of this phenotype. In conclusion, PTEN and p27(KIP1) cooperate in tumor suppression in the hematological compartment. 
CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) alleles adversely affect clinical outcome of clopidogrel therapy. Recent introduction of a newer-generation drug-eluting stent (DES) has significantly reduced the occurrence of stent thrombosis.The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of CYP2C19 LOF alleles on clinical outcome in patients treated with the newer-generation DES.The effects of CYP2C19 genotypes were evaluated on clinical outcome of clopidogrel therapy in 2062 patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention using either first-generation DES (sirolimus- and paclitaxel-eluting stent, n = 1349) or newer-generation DES (everolimus- and zotarolimus-eluting stent, n = 713). The primary clinical outcome was major cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) including cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and stent thrombosis during 1 year of follow-up.CYP2C19 LOF alleles were significantly associated with a higher risk of MACCE in patients treated with first-generation DES (hazard ratio [HR] 2.599, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.047-6.453; P = 0.034). In contrast, CYP2C19 LOF alleles were not associated with primary outcome in newer-generation DES (HR 0.716, 95% CI 0.316-1.622; P = 0.522). In the further multivariate analysis, CYP2C19 LOF alleles were not associated with MACCE in patients receiving newer-generation DES (adjusted HR 0.540, 95% CI 0.226-1.291; P = 0.166), whereas they were demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for MACCE in those implanted with first-generation DES (adjusted HR 3.501, 95% CI 1.194-10.262; P = 0.022).In contradiction to their clinical impact in first-generation DES era, CYP2C19 LOF alleles may not affect clinical outcome of clopidogrel therapy in patients treated with newer-generation DES. 
CNP is a natural regulator of adipogenesis playing a role in the development of obesity in childhood. Aim of the study was to evaluate CNP plasma levels in normal-weight (N), overweight (OW) and obese adolescents (O). Eighty two subjects (age:12.8±2.4, years) without cardiac dysfunction were enrolled and CNP plasma levels were measured by RIA. NT-proBNP, MR-proANP, AGEs, reactive hyperemia index (RHI) and standard clinical chemistry parameters were also measured. O and OW adolescents had higher values of BMI and fat mass than N. CNP levels were significantly lower in OW:4.79[3.29-21.15] and O:3.81[1.55-13.4] than in N:13.21[7.6-37.8]; p<0.0001N vs O, p=0.0003N vs OW). LogCNP values correlated significantly and inversely with BMI z-score, FM%, TF% and circulating levels of CRP, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides, in addition to an inverse relationship with skin AGEs and a direct correlation with RHI. LogCNP was also inversely associated with LogNT-proBNP and LogMR-proANP values. Using ROC analysis the risk of obesity resulted significantly (p≪0.0001) associated with CNP values (AUC=0.9724). These results suggest that CNP may play a more important role than BNP and ANP related peptides, as risk marker of obesity, in addition to its involvement in adipogenesis and endothelial dysfunction. 
CYP24A1 gene mutations induce infantile hypercalcemia, with high 1,25(OH)
COQ2 mutations have been implicated in the etiology of multiple system atrophy (MSA) in Japan. However, several genetic screenings have not confirmed the role of its variants in the disease. We performed COQ2 sequence analysis in 87 probable MSA. A homozygous change p.A43G was found in an MSA-C patient. Cosegregation analysis and the evaluation of CoQ10 content in muscle and fibroblasts did not support the pathogenic role of this variant.
PTEN functions as a guardian of the genome through multiple mechanisms. We have previously established that PTEN maintains the structural integrity of chromosomes. In this report, we demonstrate a fundamental role of PTEN in controlling chromosome inheritance to prevent gross genomic alterations. Disruption of PTEN or depletion of PTEN protein phosphatase activity causes abnormal chromosome content, manifested by enlarged or polyploid nuclei. We further identify polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) as a substrate of PTEN phosphatase. PTEN can physically associate with PLK1 and reduce PLK1 phosphorylation in a phosphatase-dependent manner. We show that PTEN deficiency leads to PLK1 phosphorylation and that a phospho-mimicking PLK1 mutant causes polyploidy, imitating functional deficiency of PTEN phosphatase. Inhibition of PLK1 activity or overexpression of a non-phosphorylatable PLK1 mutant reduces the polyploid cell population. These data reveal a new mechanism by which PTEN controls genomic stability during cell division. 
CYP27B1 converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, playing a vital role in calcium homeostasis and bone growth. Vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1 (VDDR-1) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in CYP27B1.
ALOX15 (12/15-lipoxygenase) orthologs have been implicated in maturational degradation of intracellular organelles and in the biosynthesis of antiinflammatory and proresolving eicosanoids. Here we hypothesized that lower mammals (mice, rats, pigs) express 12-lipoxygenating ALOX15 orthologs. In contrast, 15-lipoxygenating isoforms are found in higher primates (orangutans, men), and these results suggest an evolution of ALOX15 specificity. To test this hypothesis we first cloned and characterized ALOX15 orthologs of selected Catarrhini representing different stages of late primate evolution and found that higher primates (men, chimpanzees) express 15-lipoxygenating orthologs. In contrast, lower primates (baboons, rhesus monkeys) express 12-lipoxygenating enzymes. Gibbons, which are flanked in evolution by rhesus monkeys (12-lipoxygenating ALOX15) and orangutans (15-lipoxygenating ALOX15), express an ALOX15 ortholog with pronounced dual specificity. To explore the driving force for this evolutionary alterations, we quantified the lipoxin synthase activity of 12-lipoxygenating (rhesus monkey, mouse, rat, pig, humIle418Ala) and 15-lipoxygenating (man, chimpanzee, orangutan, rabbit, ratLeu353Phe) ALOX15 variants and found that, when normalized to their arachidonic acid oxygenase activities, the lipoxin synthase activities of 15-lipoxygenating ALOX15 variants were more than fivefold higher (P < 0.01) [corrected]. Comparative molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations indicated that, for the 15-lipoxygenating rabbit ALOX15, the energy barrier for C13-hydrogen abstraction (15-lipoxygenation) was 17 kJ/mol lower than for arachidonic acid 12-lipoxygenation. In contrast, for the 12-lipoxygenating Ile418Ala mutant, the energy barrier for 15-lipoxygenation was 10 kJ/mol higher than for 12-lipoxygenation. Taken together, our data suggest an evolution of ALOX15 specificity, which is aimed at optimizing the biosynthetic capacity for antiinflammatory and proresolving lipoxins.
PIK3CA is often mutated in a variety of malignancies, including colon, gastric, ovary, breast, and brain tumors. We investigated PIK3CA expression in gastric cancer and explored the relationships between the PIK3CA expression level and clinicopathological features as well as survival of the patients.
CP Grade II titanium was first anodized in order to form TiO2 nanotubes, and then the TiO2 nano- tubes were coated with hydroxyapatite using the sol-gel method. The electrochemical properties of pure Ti, anodized TiO2 nanotubes, and HA-coated TiO2 nanotubes were investigated using poten- tiodynamic polarization and impedance tests. The sol-gel-coated HA nanoparticles were observed to sufficiently penetrate into the TiO2 nanotubes, and the polarization resistance of the HA-coated titanium nanotubes was higher than that of those that had just been anodized. In conclusion, the HA coating on the TiO2 nanotubes provides improved electrochemical properties and can be effective in overcoming the negative influence of passive TiO2 films.
RPE scales are used in exercise science research to assess perceptions of physical effort. RPE scale validity has been evaluated by assessing correlations between RPE and physiological indicators. Cross-sectional studies indicate that RPE scale validity improves with age; however, this has not been studied longitudinally.
FH is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by increased TC and LDL level, which leads to xanthomas, atherosclerosis, and cardiac complications even in childhood. The treatment options are diet, medical treatment, lipid apheresis, and LT. The aim of our study was to analyze our data of patients with FH. Between 2004 and 2015, there were 51 patients who underwent pediatric LT at our center. All patients with FH were identified, and the data were retrospectively analyzed. There were eight patients with homozygous FH in the median age of 10 years (IQR 6-12) who underwent LT. The median pre-operative TC and LDL levels were 611 mg/dL (IQR: 460-844) and 574 mg/dL (IQR: 398-728) and decreased to normal levels 1 week after LT (TC: 193 mg/dL and LDL: 141 mg/dL). Two patients died two and 18 months after LT due to sudden cardiac arrest. Both patients were diagnosed with cardiovascular disease pre-operatively. The LT is the only curative treatment for this disease. To achieve an excellent outcome, it should be performed before the development of cardiovascular disease, because the regression of severe cardiovascular disease after transplantation is limited.
SYNJ1 encodes a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase, synaptojanin 1, which contains two consecutive phosphatase domains and plays a prominent role in synaptic vesicle dynamics. Autosomal recessive inherited variants in SYNJ1 have previously been associated with two different neurological diseases: a recurrent homozygous missense variant (p.Arg258Gln) that abolishes Sac1 phosphatase activity was identified in three independent families with early onset parkinsonism, whereas a homozygous nonsense variant (p.Arg136*) causing a severe decrease of mRNA transcript was found in a single patient with intractable epilepsy and tau pathology. We performed whole exome or genome sequencing in three independent sib pairs with early onset refractory seizures and progressive neurological decline, and identified novel segregating recessive SYNJ1 defects. A homozygous missense variant resulting in an amino acid substitution (p.Tyr888Cys) was found to impair, but not abolish, the dual phosphatase activity of SYNJ1, whereas three premature stop variants (homozygote p.Trp843* and compound heterozygote p.Gln647Argfs*6/p.Ser1122Thrfs*3) almost completely abolished mRNA transcript production. A genetic follow-up screening in a large cohort of 543 patients with a wide phenotypical range of epilepsies and intellectual disability revealed no additional pathogenic variants, showing that SYNJ1 deficiency is rare and probably linked to a specific phenotype. While variants leading to early onset parkinsonism selectively abolish Sac1 function, our results provide evidence that a critical reduction of the dual phosphatase activity of SYNJ1 underlies a severe disorder with neonatal refractory epilepsy and a neurodegenerative disease course. These findings further expand the clinical spectrum of synaptic dysregulation in patients with severe epilepsy, and emphasize the importance of this biological pathway in seizure pathophysiology.
ABCA3 glycoprotein belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters, which utilize the energy derived from hydrolysis of ATP for the translocation of a wide variety of substrates across the plasma membrane. Mutations in the ABCA3 gene are knowingly causative for fatal surfactant deficiency, particularly respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in term babies.
CYP1A1 is an important phase I xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme involved in the metabolism of numbers of toxins, endogenous hormones and drugs. Polymorphisms in this phase I gene can alter enzyme activity and induction, also are known to be associated with cancer susceptibility related to environmental toxins and hormone exposure. The present study was aimed to determine the frequencies of commonly known functional polymorphismsof CYP1A1 gene including CYP1A1 m1 (MspI), and CYP1A1 m2 (Ile-Val) in a healthy population from the west of Mazandaran province, Iran. A total of 200 unrelated healthy subjects from Mazandaran province, residing in Tonekabon city, coming for blood donating at Tonekabon Blood Transfusion Center were enrolled. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes of each subject. All subjects were genotyped for CYP1A1 m1 (T>C) and m2 (A>G) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The frequencies of the TT(wt/wt), TC(wt/mt) and CC(mt/mt) genotypes were as 65.5%, 32.0% and 2.5% respectively for m1 and frequencies of the AA(wt/wt), AG(wt/mt) and GG(mt/mt) genotypes were as 84.5%, 15% and 0.5% respectively for the m2. The frequencies of T and C alleles in the population were 81.5% and 18.5% respectively and the frequencies of A and G alleles were 92% and 8% respectively. Results of the present study might be important in understanding the distribution of CYP1A1 (m1) and CYP1A1 (m2) polymorphisms in Mazandaran province of Iran. Moreover, these results may determine the susceptibilities of individuals towards environmental procarcinogens that result in several cancers. 
HAL colectomy is a technique perceived to provide the benefits of laparoscopic surgery while improving tactile feedback and operative time. Published data are largely limited to small, single-institution studies.
CD36 is known to be an orosensory receptor for dietary long-chain fatty acids, as well as being involved in the chemosensory mechanisms within the human gut. Recent data have demonstrated an association between CD36 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and lipid consumption behaviours in humans. This study aimed to test for associations between CD36 SNPs and response to a high-fat meal in a young healthy Australian cohort. Secondary associations were tested between CD36 gene variants and fasting lipid parameters, body composition, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and measures of oral fat preference.
SLC5A8 has been shown to be associated with a large number of cancer progressions. However, the biological functions of SLC5A8 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unclear. Therefore, we performed this research to explore the functions of SLC5A8 in HCC progression. In this study, SLC5A8 protein and mRNA expression were examined by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively, and we found significantly lower expression levels in HCCs than in the corresponding normal liver tissues. Low SLC5A8 expression was significantly correlated with the clinicopathological features of HCC patients. Patients with low SLC5A8 expression have a shorter overall survival time. This interpretation is confirmed by the results obtained from our in vitro experiments; functional assays indicated that overexpression of SLC5A8, by infection with a recombinant plasmid containing SLC5A8, significantly suppressed HCC cell growth, invasion, and migration and induced HCC cell apoptosis. Moreover, the expression levels of beta-catenin, cyclin D1, c-Myc, MMP-2, and FAK detected by western blotting were downregulated in SLC5A8-transfected HCC cells compared with control-transfected cells, indicating that SLC5A8 has a tumor-suppressive function that acts by interfering with Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HCC.
SLC52A3 was recently identified as a susceptibility gene for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, associations between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs13042395 (C > T) and rs3746803 (G > A) in SLC52A3 and risk, tumor characteristics and survival of ESCC patients remain inconclusive and of unknown prognostic significance.
ABCG2 (BCRP - breast cancer resistance protein) belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. It plays an important role in the disposition and elimination of xeno- and endobiotics and/or their metabolites in mammals. Likewise, the protective role of ABC transporters, including Abcg2, has been reported for aquatic organisms. In our previous study we have cloned the full gene sequence of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Abcg2a and showed its high expression in liver and primary hepatocytes. Based on those insights, the main goal of this study was to perform a detailed functional characterization of trout Abcg2a using insect ovary cells (Spodoptera frugiperda, Sf9) as a heterologous expression system. Membrane vesicles preparations from Sf9 cells were used for the ATPase assay determinations and basic biochemical properties of fish Abcg2a versus human ABCG2 have been compared. A series of 39 physiologically and/or environmentally relevant substances was then tested on interaction with trout Abcg2a and human ABCG2. Correlation analysis reveals highly similar pattern of activation and inhibition. Significant activation of trout Abcg2a ATPase was observed for prazosin, doxorubicine, sildenafil, furosemid, propranolol, fenofibrate and pheophorbide. Pesticides showed either a weak activation (malathione) or strong (endosulfan) to weak (chlorpyrifos, fenoxycarb, DDE) inhibition of trout Abcg2a ATPase while the highest activation was obtained for benzo(a)pyrene, curcumine and testosterone. In conclusion, data from this study offer the first characterization of fish Abcg2a, reveal potent interactors among physiologically or environmentally relevant substances and point to similarities regarding strengths and interactor preferences between human ABCG2 and fish Abcg2a.
PIK3CA is the most frequent somatic mutated oncogene in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. We previously observed an association between PIK3CA genotype and aromatase inhibitors (AI) treatment outcome. This study now evaluates whether expression of mRNAs and miRs are linked to PIK3CA genotype and are independently related to AI therapy response in order to define potential expressed biomarkers for treatment outcome.
COQ2 (p-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyl transferase) encodes the enzyme required for the second step of the final reaction sequence of Coenzyme Q
LPL contains two principal domains: an amino-terminal catalytic domain (residues 1-297) and a carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 298-448) that is important for binding lipids and binding glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) (an endothelial cell protein that shuttles LPL to the capillary lumen). The LPL sequences required for GPIHBP1 binding have not been examined in detail, but one study suggested that sequences near LPL's carboxyl terminus (residues ∼403-438) were crucial. Here, we tested the ability of LPL-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to block the binding of LPL to GPIHBP1. One antibody, 88B8, abolished LPL binding to GPIHBP1. Consistent with those results, antibody 88B8 could not bind to GPIHBP1-bound LPL on cultured cells. Antibody 88B8 bound poorly to LPL proteins with amino acid substitutions that interfered with GPIHBP1 binding (e.g., C418Y, E421K). However, the sequences near LPL's carboxyl terminus (residues ∼403-438) were not sufficient for 88B8 binding; upstream sequences (residues 298-400) were also required. Additional studies showed that these same sequences are required for LPL binding to GPIHBP1. In conclusion, we identified an LPL mAb that binds to LPL's GPIHBP1-binding domain. The binding of both antibody 88B8 and GPIHBP1 to LPL depends on large segments of LPL's carboxyl-terminal domain.
ABO incompatible kidney transplant recipients receive higher dose of immunosuppression. Previous data indicate that the incidence of malignancy is not higher in these patients. Compared to the general population, renal transplant recipients are at 4.4-fold higher risk of developing myeloma. We describe a case of posttransplant multiple myeloma in an ABO incompatible renal transplant recipient of a second graft. 
PTEN is a one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressors in human cancers. It is essential for regulating diverse biological processes and through its lipid phosphatase activity regulates the PI 3-Kinase signaling pathway. Sensitive phosphatase assays are employed to study the catalytic activity of PTEN against phospholipid substrates. Here we describe protocols to assay PTEN lipid phosphatase activity using either purified enzyme (purified PTEN lipid phosphatase assay) or PTEN immunopurified from tissues or cultured cells (cellular IP PTEN lipid phosphatase assay) against vesicles containing radiolabeled PIP3 substrate.
CYP2D6 is an important cytochrome P450 (P450) enzyme that metabolizes approximately 25% of therapeutic drugs. Its genetic polymorphisms may significantly influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clinically used drugs. Studying the effects of CYP2D6 on drug metabolism can help reduce adverse drug reactions and therapeutic failure to some extent. This study aimed to investigate the role of CYP2D6 in nebivolol metabolism by evaluating the effect of 24 CYP2D6 variants on the metabolism of nebivolol in vitro. CYP2D6 variants expressed by insect cell systems were incubated with 0.1-80 μM nebivolol for 30 minutes at 37°C and the reaction was terminated by cooling to -80°C immediately. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system was used to analyze nebivolol and its metabolite 4-hydroxy nebivolol. Compared with CYP2D6.1, the intrinsic clearance values of most variants were significantly altered, and most of these variants exhibited either reduced V
GBA gene mutations are the greatest cause of Parkinson disease (PD). GBA encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) but the mechanisms by which loss of GCase contributes to PD remain unclear. Inhibition of autophagy and the generation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are both implicated. Mutant GCase can unfold in the ER and be degraded via the unfolded protein response, activating ER stress and reducing lysosomal GCase. Small molecule chaperones that cross the blood brain barrier help mutant GCase refold and traffic correctly to lysosomes are putative treatments for PD. We treated fibroblast cells from PD patients with heterozygous GBA mutations and Drosophila expressing human wild-type, N370S and L444P GBA with the molecular chaperones ambroxol and isofagomine. Both chaperones increased GCase levels and activity, but also GBA mRNA, in control and mutant GBA fibroblasts. Expression of mutated GBA in Drosophila resulted in dopaminergic neuronal loss, a progressive locomotor defect, abnormal aggregates in the ER and increased levels of the ER stress reporter Xbp1-EGFP. Treatment with both chaperones lowered ER stress and prevented the loss of motor function, providing proof of principle that small molecule chaperones can reverse mutant GBA-mediated ER stress in vivo and might prove effective for treating PD.
NAMPT inhibitors may show potential as therapeutics for oncology. Throughout our NAMPT inhibitor program, we found that exposed pyridines or related heterocyclic systems in the left-hand portion of the inhibitors are necessary pharmacophores for potent cellular NAMPT inhibition. However, when combined with a benzyl group in the center of the inhibitors, such pyridine-like moieties also led to consistent and potent inhibition of CYP2C9. In an attempt to reduce CYP2C9 inhibition, a parallel synthesis approach was used to identify central benzyl group replacements with increased Fsp3. A spirocyclic central motif was thus discovered that was combined with left-hand pyridines (or pyridine-like systems) to provide cellularly potent NAMPT inhibitors with minimal CYP2C9 inhibition. Further optimization of potency and ADME properties led to the discovery of compound 68, a highly potent NAMPT inhibitor with outstanding efficacy in a mouse tumor xenograft model and lacking measurable CYP2C9 inhibition at the concentrations tested.
PTEN acts as a tumor suppressor primarily by antagonizing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. PTEN is frequently mutated in human cancers; however, in type II endometrial cancers its mutation rate is very low. Overexpression of TGF-β1 and its receptors has been reported to correlate with metastasis of human cancers and reduced survival rates. Although TGF-β1 has been shown to regulate PTEN expression through various mechanisms, it is not yet known if the same is true in type II endometrial cancer. In the present study, we show that treatment with TGF-β1 stimulates the migration of two type II endometrial cancer cell lines, KLE and HEC-50. In addition, TGF-β1 treatment down-regulates both mRNA and protein levels of PTEN. Overexpression of PTEN or inhibition of PI3K abolishes TGF-β1-stimulated cell migration. TGF-β1 induces SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and knockdown of common SMAD4 inhibits the suppressive effects of TGF-β1 on PTEN mRNA and protein. Interestingly, TGF-β1 induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation and pre-treatment with a MEK inhibitor attenuates the suppression of PTEN protein, but not mRNA, by TGF-β1. This study provides important insights into the molecular mechanisms mediating TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of PTEN and demonstrates an important role of PTEN in the regulation of type II endometrial cancer cell migration.
DCK is a rate-limiting enzyme in cytarabine activation. rs4643786 and rs67437265 (P122S) variants are reported to affect DCK activity.
SMYD3 is a member of the SET and MYND-domain family of methyl-transferases, the increased expression of which correlates with poor prognosis in various types of cancer. In liver and colon tumors, SMYD3 is localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with RNA Pol II and H3K4me3 and functions as a selective transcriptional amplifier of oncogenes and genes that control cell proliferation and metastatic spread. Smyd3 expression has a high discriminative power for the characterization of liver tumors and positively correlates with poor prognosis. In lung and pancreatic cancer, SMYD3 acts in the cytoplasm, potentiating oncogenic Ras/ERK signaling through the methylation of the MAP3K2 kinase and the subsequent release from its inhibitor. A clinico-pathological analysis of lung cancer patients uncovers prognostic significance of SMYD3 only for first progression survival. However, stratification of patients according to their smoking history significantly expands the prognostic value of SMYD3 to overall survival and other features, suggesting that smoking-related effects saturate the clinical analysis and mask the function of SMYD3 as an oncogenic potentiator.
PIK3CA mutation represents a clinical subset of diverse carcinomas. We explored the status of PIK3CA mutation and evaluated its genetic variability, treatment, and prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. A total of 810 patients with completely resected lung adenocarcinoma were recruited between 2008 and 2013. The status of PIK3CA mutation and other three genes, that is, EGFR mutation, KRAS mutation and ALK fusion were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Survival curves were plotted with the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank for comparison. Cox proportional hazard model was performed for multivariate analysis. Among the 810 patients, 23 cases of PIK3CA mutation were identified with a frequency of 2.8%. There were 14 men and 9 women with a median age of 61 years. Seventeen tumors revealed concurrent gene abnormalities of EGFR mutation (n = 12), KRAS mutation (n = 3), and ALK fusion (n = 2). Seven patients with EGFR & PIK3CA mutations recurred and administrated of EGFR-TKIs yielded a median progression free-survival of 6.0 months. Among four eviromous-treated patients, stable disease was observed in three patients with a median Progression-free survival (PFS) of 3.5 months. Patients with and without PIK3CA mutation had different overall survivals (32.2 vs. 49.6 months, P = 0.003). Multivariate analysis revealed that PIK3CA mutation was an independent predictor of poor overall survival (HR = 2.37, P = 0.017). The frequency of PIK3CA mutation was around 2.8% in the Chinese patients of lung adenocarcinoma. PIK3CA mutation was associated with reduced PFS of EGFR-TKIs treatment and shorter overall survival.
NQO1 (NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1) reduces quinones and xenobiotics to less-reactive compounds via 2-electron reduction, one feature responsible for the role of NQO1 in antioxidant defense in several tissues. In contrast, NADPH cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CYP450OR), catalyzes the 1-electron reduction of quinones and xenobiotics, resulting in enhanced superoxide formation. However, to date, the roles of NQO1 and CYP450OR in pancreatic β-cell metabolism under basal conditions and oxidant challenge have not been characterized. Using NQO1 inhibition, over-expression and knock out, we have demonstrated that, in addition to protection of β-cells from toxic concentrations of the redox cycling quinone menadione, NQO1 also regulates the basal level of reduced-to-oxidized nucleotides, suggesting other role(s) beside that of an antioxidant enzyme. In contrast, over-expression of NADPH cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CYP450OR) resulted in enhanced redox cycling activity and decreased cellular viability, consistent with the enhanced generation of superoxide and H
ABO blood group-incompatible kidney transplantation (ABOiKTx) outcomes are good, but complications are more common than in conventional transplantation. Regimens that use extracorporeal antibody removal therapy (EART) and enhanced immunosuppression are guided by titration of ABO blood group antibodies (using hemagglutination [HA] dilution assays), and these assays vary significantly in performance between centers. This study aims to describe the differences in titer measurement and the effect on clinical practice and outcomes.
SMYD3 methyltransferase is nearly undetectable in normal human tissues but highly expressed in several cancers, including breast cancer, although its contributions to pathogenesis in this setting are unclear. Here we report that histone H2A.Z.1 is a substrate of SMYD3 that supports malignancy. SMYD3-mediated dimethylation of H2A.Z.1 at lysine 101 (H2A.Z.1K101me2) increased stability by preventing binding to the removal chaperone ANP32E and facilitating its interaction with histone H3. Moreover, a microarray analysis identified cyclin A1 as a target coregulated by SMYD3 and H2A.Z.1K101me2. The colocalization of SMYD3 and H2A.Z.1K101me2 at the promoter of cyclin A1 activated its expression and G
SETDB2 is a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) tri-methyltransferase that is involved in transcriptional gene silencing. Since it is still unknown whether SETDB2 is linked to carcinogenesis, we studied alterations and functions of SETDB2 in human gastric cancers (GCs). SETDB2 protein was highly expressed in 30 of 72 (41.7%) primary GC tissues compared with their normal counterparts by immunohistochemistry. SETDB2 overexpression was significantly associated with the late stage of GCs (P<0.05) and poor prognosis of GC patients (P<0.05). The GC cell lines with SETDB2 knockdown and overexpression significantly decreased and increased cell proliferation, migration and invasion, respectively (P<0.05). Knockdown of SETDB2 in MKN74 and MKN45 cells reduced global H3K9 tri-methylation (me3) levels. Microarray analysis indicated that expression of WWOX and CADM1, tumor suppressor genes, was significantly enhanced in MKN74 cells after SETDB2 knockdown. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the H3K9me3 levels at the promoter regions of these two genes corresponded to the SETDB2 expression levels in GC cells. Moreover, ectopic SETDB2 protein was recruited to their promoter regions. Our data suggest that SETDB2 is associated with transcriptional repression of WWOX and CADM1, and hence overexpression of SETDB2 may contribute to GC progression.
HSD3B1 (1245A>C) has been mechanistically linked to castration-resistant prostate cancer because it encodes an altered enzyme that augments dihydrotestosterone synthesis from non-gonadal precursors. We postulated that men inheriting the HSD3B1 (1245C) allele would exhibit resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).
ABO is a blood group system of high clinical significance due to the prevalence of ABO variation that can cause major, potentially life-threatening, transfusion reactions.
PIK3CA (which encodes the PI3K alpha isoform) is the most frequently mutated oncogene in breast cancer. Small-molecule PI3K inhibitors have shown promise in clinical trials; however, intrinsic and acquired resistance limits their utility. We used a systematic gain-of-function approach to identify genes whose upregulation confers resistance to the PI3K inhibitor BYL719 in breast cancer cells. Among the validated resistance genes, Proviral Insertion site in Murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinases conferred resistance by maintaining downstream PI3K effector activation in an AKT-independent manner. Concurrent pharmacologic inhibition of PIM and PI3K overcame this resistance mechanism. We also observed increased PIM expression and activity in a subset of breast cancer biopsies with clinical resistance to PI3K inhibitors. PIM1 overexpression was mutually exclusive with PIK3CA mutation in treatment-naïve breast cancers, suggesting downstream functional redundancy. Together, these results offer new insights into resistance to PI3K inhibitors and support clinical studies of combined PIM/PI3K inhibition in a subset of PIK3CA-mutant cancers.
ABO blood group antigen incompatibility (ABO mismatch) is not an obstacle to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). However, the impact on clinical outcome after allo-SCT remains controversial. We analyzed 512 patients after allogeneic peripheral blood SCT (allo-PBSCT) for an association of ABO mismatch with transfusion requirements, myeloid and platelet engraftment, the incidence of GvHD, relapse, transplant-related mortality (TRM), and overall survival (OS). A total of 260 patients underwent ABO-mismatched transplantation and the control group consisted of 252 patients with ABO-matched allo-PBSCT. We found a significant association between major-0 ABO mismatch (group 0 recipient/group A, B, or AB donor) and increased red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusion requirements (both P<.001) as well as delayed platelet engraftment (P<.001). Minor-A (group A recipient/group 0 donor) and minor-AB (group AB recipient/group 0, A, or B donor) ABO mismatch was significantly associated with an increased TRM after allo-PBSCT (P=.001 and P=.02). In multivariate analysis performed using Cox regression, minor ABO mismatch appeared as independent risk factor for TRM after allo-PBSCT. No association was found for ABO mismatch with the incidence of GvHD, relapse, and OS. Our results suggest that ABO blood group mismatch has a significant impact on the outcome and that minor-A and minor-AB ABO mismatch represents a risk factor for increased TRM after allo-PBSCT.
BCAT1 (branched-chain amino acid trasaminase1) expression is necessary for the progression of IDH1 wild-type (WT) glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is known to be associated with aggressive tumors. The purpose of our study is to investigate the bevacizumab resistance increased by the expression of BCAT1 in IDH1 WT GBM in a rat model, which was evaluated using DSC perfusion MRI. BCAT1 sh#1 inhibits cell proliferation and limits cell migration potential in vitro. In vivo MRI showed that the increase in both tumor volume and nCBV after bevacizumab treatment in IDH1 WT tumors was significantly higher compared with BCAT1 sh#1tumors. In a histological analysis, more micro-vessel reformation by bevacizumab resistance was observed in IDH1 WT tumors than BCAT1 sh#1 tumors. These findings indicate that BCAT1 expression in IDH1 WT GBM increases resistance to bevacizumab treatment, which could be assessed by DSC perfusion MRI, and that nCBV can be a surrogate imaging biomarker for the prediction of antiangiogenic treatment in GBM.
SUCLA2 defects have been associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion and the triad of hypotonia, dystonia/Leigh-like syndrome, and deafness. A 9-year-old Brazilian boy of consanguineous parents presented with psychomotor delay, deafness, myopathy, ataxia, and chorea. Despite the prominent movement disorder, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal while 
CD36 is a scavenger receptor involved in fatty acid metabolism, innate immunity and angiogenesis. It interacts with lipoprotein particles and facilitates uptake of long chain fatty acids. It is also the most common target of the PfEMP1 proteins of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, tethering parasite-infected erythrocytes to endothelial receptors. This prevents their destruction by splenic clearance and allows increased parasitaemia. Here we describe the structure of CD36 in complex with long chain fatty acids and a CD36-binding PfEMP1 protein domain. A conserved hydrophobic pocket allows the hugely diverse PfEMP1 protein family to bind to a conserved phenylalanine residue at the membrane distal tip of CD36. This phenylalanine is also required for CD36 to interact with lipoprotein particles. By targeting a site on CD36 that is required for its physiological function, PfEMP1 proteins maintain the ability to tether to the endothelium and avoid splenic clearance.
PFKFB3 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase) synthesizes fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6P2), which is an allosteric activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1), the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis. Overexpression of the PFKFB3 enzyme leads to high glycolytic metabolism, which is required for cancer cells to survive in the harsh tumor microenvironment. The objective of this study was to investigate the antitumor activity of PFK15 (1-(4-pyridinyl)-3-(2-quinolinyl)-2-propen-1-one), a small molecule inhibitor of PFKFB3, against gastric cancer and to explore its potential mechanisms. The effects of PFK15 on proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle progression in gastric cancer cells were evaluated by cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays, flow cytometry, and western blotting. In addition, the invasion inhibition effects of PFK15 were measured by transwell invasion assay and western blot analysis, and a xenograft tumor model was used to verify the therapeutic effect of PFK15 in vivo. Results showed that PFK15 inhibited the proliferation, caused cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase by blocking the Cyclin-CDKs/Rb/E2F signaling pathway, and induced apoptosis through mitochondria in gastric cancer cells. Tumor volume and weight were also significantly reduced upon intraperitoneal injection with PFK15 at 25 mg/kg. In addition, PFK15 inhibited the invasion of gastric cancer cells by downregulating focal adhesion kinase (FAK) expression and upregulating E-cadherin expression. Taken together, our findings indicate that PFK15 is a promising anticancer drug for treating gastric cancer.
SMS is a widely used technology globally and may also improve ART adherence, yet SMS notifications to social supporters following real-time detection of missed doses showed no clear benefit in a recent pilot trial. We examine the demographic and social-cultural dynamics that may explain this finding. In the trial, 63 HIV-positive individuals initiating ART received a real-time adherence monitor and were randomized to two types of SMS reminder interventions versus a control (no SMS). SMS notifications were also sent to 45 patient-identified social supporters for sustained adherence lapses. Like participants, social supporters were interviewed at enrollment, following their matched participant's adherence lapse and at exit. Social supporters with regular income (RR = 0.27, P = 0.001) were significantly associated with fewer adherence lapses. Instrumental support was associated with fewer adherence lapses only among social supporters who were food secure (RR = 0.58, P = 0.003). Qualitative interview data revealed diverse and complex economic and relationship dynamics, affecting social support. Resource availability in emotionally positive relationships seemingly facilitated helpful support, while limited resources prevented active provision of support for many. Effective social support appeared subject to social supporters' food security, economic stability and a well-functioning social network dependent on trust and supportive disclosure.
G6PD deficiency has been the most pervasive inherited disorder in the world since having been discovered. G6PD has an antioxidant role by functioning as a major nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) provider to reduce excessive oxidative stress. NADPH can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) mediated by NADPH oxidase (NOX) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), respectively. Hence, G6PD also has a pro-oxidant role. Research in the past has focused on the enhanced susceptibility of G6PD-deficient cells or individuals to oxidative challenge. The cytoregulatory role of G6PD has largely been overlooked. By using a metabolomic approach, it is noted that upon oxidant challenge, G6PD-deficient cells will reprogram the GSH metabolism from regeneration to synthesis with exhaustive energy consumption. Recently, new cellular/physiologic roles of G6PD have been discovered. By using a proteomic approach, it has been found that G6PD plays a regulatory role in xenobiotic metabolism possibly via NOX and the redox-sensitive Nrf2-signaling pathway to modulate the expression of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. Since G6PD is a key regulator responsible for intracellular redox homeostasis, G6PD deficiency can alter redox balance leading to many abnormal cellular effects such as the cellular inflammatory and immune response against viral infection. G6PD may play an important role in embryogenesis as G6PD-knockdown mouse cannot produce offspring and G6PD-deficient C. elegans with defective egg production and hatching. This array of findings indicates that the cellular and physiologic roles of G6PD, other than the classical role as an antioxidant enzyme, deserve further attention.
FAXDC2 (fatty acid hydroxylase domain containing 2) is a member of the fatty acid hydroxylase superfamily. Given the important role of fatty acids in megakaryocytes, we have studied the role of this gene in the development of this lineage. Here we show that the expression of FAXDC2 is constantly elevated during megakaryocyte maturation. In contrast, FAXDC2 is significantly downregulated in acute myeloid leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Moreover, FAXDC2 overexpression promotes the differentiation of megakaryocytic cell lines and primary cells, whereas its knockdown disrupts their maturation. Mechanism study shows that FAXDC2 overexpression enhances extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and increases RUNX1 (Runt-related transcription factor 1) expression. FAXDC2 also restores megakaryocytic differentiation in cells exposed to an ERK inhibitor or those expressing a dominant negative form of RUNX1. Finally, FAXDC2 overexpression leads to an increase in sphingolipid GM3 synthase, suggesting a potential role of FAXDC2 in lipid metabolism that increases ERK signaling and facilitates megakaryocyte differentiation. Together, these results show that FAXDC2 plays a novel role in development of megakaryocytes and its dysregulation may contribute to abnormal hematopoietic cell development in leukemia.
CFTR biogenesis starts with its co-translational insertion into the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum and folding of the cytosolic domains, towards the acquisition of a fully folded compact native structure. Efficiency of this process is assessed by the ER quality control system that allows the exit of folded proteins but targets unfolded/misfolded CFTR to degradation. If allowed to leave the ER, CFTR is modified at the Golgi and reaches the post-Golgi compartments to be delivered to the plasma membrane where it functions as a cAMP- and phosphorylation-regulated chloride/bicarbonate channel. CFTR residence at the membrane is a balance of membrane delivery, endocytosis, and recycling. Several adaptors, motor, and scaffold proteins contribute to the regulation of CFTR stability and are involved in continuously assessing its structure through peripheral quality control systems. Regulation of CFTR biogenesis and traffic (and its dysregulation by mutations, such as the most common F508del) determine its overall activity and thus contribute to the fine modulation of chloride secretion and hydration of epithelial surfaces. This review covers old and recent knowledge on CFTR folding and trafficking from its synthesis to the regulation of its stability at the plasma membrane and highlights how several of these steps can be modulated to promote the rescue of mutant CFTR.
CFTR protein is an ion channel regulated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and expressed in many types of epithelial cells. CFTR-mediated chloride and bicarbonate secretion play an important role in the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Pharmacological modulators of CFTR represent promising drugs for a variety of diseases. In particular, correctors and potentiators may restore the activity of CFTR in cystic fibrosis patients. Potentiators are also potentially useful to improve mucociliary clearance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. On the other hand, CFTR inhibitors may be useful to block fluid and electrolyte loss in secretory diarrhea and slow down the progression of polycystic kidney disease.
DIO3 gene encoding type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase is an imprinted gene, located in the DLK1-DIO3 (delta-like 1 homolog-type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase) imprinted domain, and is potentially involved in degrading excessive amounts of thyroid hormone to protect embryogenesis. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism of the imprinted DIO3 gene expression during fetal and neonatal development in goats has not been elucidated. In this study, we explored the DNA methylation patterns of the caprine DIO3 intragenic CpG island and quantified gene expression level in six tissues from Chinese Nanjiang Yellow 3-day old kids. The expression of the DIO3 gene was determined using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCRs), while the identification of methylation patterns was determined using bisulfite-sequencing PCRs. Modest, and non-significant (P > 0.05), methylation patterns were noted for the DIO3 CpG island methylation in the brain, heart, liver, kidney, lung, and longissimus dorsi tissues (ranging from 26.48 to 34.92%). The expression level of the DIO3 mRNA was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the liver tissue than in the other five tissues. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that there was no significant relationship between methylation and gene expression (P > 0.05), which indicated that the expression of the caprine DIO3 gene was likely modified by other regulatory elements. This study identified DNA methylation and expression patterns of the DIO3 gene in goats and provided insights into further regulatory mechanisms of expression and imprinting in the DLK1-DIO3 domain.
PTEN is a tyrosine phosphatase with significant function in inhibiting STAT3 activation. Recently, inactivation of STAT3 has been demonstrated as a therapeutic candidate for autoimmune arthritis. The expression of PTEN controlled by p53 regulates autoimmune arthritis through modulating the balance between Th17 and Treg. We hypothesized that PTEN regulated by p53 might reduce CIA severity and inflammatory response via inhibiting STAT3 activation. Our results revealed that PTEN could ameliorate experimental autoimmune arthritis by reducing STAT3 activity and Th17 differentiation. Systemic infusion of PTEN overexpression downregulated CIA severity. In addition, PTEN overexpression decreased the activation of T cells and modulated reciprocal differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells. We observed that PTEN expression downregulated by p53 deficiency induced the activation of STAT3. Loss of p53 exacerbated autoimmune arthritis and dysregulated the population of Th17 and Treg. These data suggest that induction of STAT3-modulatory activity of PTEN may be a therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis therapy.
PTEN is a key tumor suppressor gene that can play a regulatory role in the cellular proliferation, survival and apoptosis. In this study, the full-length PTEN (EcPTEN) was obtained, containing a 5'UTR of 745 bp, an ORF of 1269 bp and a 3'UTR of 106 bp. The EcPTEN gene encoded a polypeptide of 422 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 49.14 KDa and a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 6.34. The deduced amino acid sequence analysis showed that EcPTEN comprised the conserved residues and the characteristic domains known to the critical functionality of PTEN. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that EcPTEN mRNA was broadly expressed in all the examined tissues, while the highest expression level was observed in liver, followed by the expression in blood, kidney, spleen, heart, gill, muscle and intestine. The groupers challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus showed a sharp increase of EcPTEN mRNA expression in immune tissues. In addition, western blotting analysis confirmed that the up-regulation of EcPTEN protein expression was steadily induced in liver. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that EcPTEN was localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Overexpression of EcPTEN can activate the apoptotic cascade and abrogate NF-kB, AP-1, Stat3 and Myc promoter activity in Hela cells. These results indicated that EcPTEN harboring highly-conserved domains with a close sequence similarity to those of PTP superfamily may disrupt the mammalian signalings and play a regulatory role in the apoptotic process.
CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 are generally served as the major adult and fetal liver forms, respectively, and exhibited a developmental switch during liver maturation. The objective of this study was to explore the potential mechanisms associated with the developmental switch of CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 in the Chinese Han population. We analyzed CYP3A4/7, nuclear receptors, and epigenetic modifications in human liver samples. We found that the expression levels of CYP3A4 mRNA in adults were significantly higher than the levels in fetus. In contrast, CYP3A7 mRNA expression reached a maximal level at an estimated gestational age of 25 weeks and then substantially decreased during the first year after birth. We also found that the expression level of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) was most associated with CYP3A4 expression in adult liver; whereas the expression level of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was intensively correlated with CYP3A7 expression in fetal liver. Furthermore, we illustrated the dynamic changes of H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 in the developmental switch of CYP3A7 and CYP3A4. In summary, our data suggested that HNF4A and GR, and epigenetic changes of H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 are associated with the ontogenic expressions of CYP3A4/3A7 in the livers of the Chinese Han population.
LPIN1 is a protein that exhibits dual functions as a phosphatidic acid phosphatase enzyme in regulation of triglyceride and glycerophospholipid metabolism and a transcriptional coregulator. Through unknown tumour-promoting mechanism, LPIN1 frequently observed in various human cancer cell lines controls main cellular processes involved in cancer progression. Here, we demonstrate that LPIN1 enhances the tumour-promoting function of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) by controlling IRS1 stability. LPIN1 interacts with IRS1 in an insulin growth factor-1-dependent signalling pathway and inhibits its serine phosphorylation, and thereby eliminating ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IRS1 via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. Consequently, LPIN1 overexpression increases IRS1 abundance and enhances IRS1's ability to induce epithelial cell proliferation and mammary tumourigenesis. By contrast, depletion or inhibition of LPIN1 in breast cancer cells leads to a decreased IRS1 level, which subsequently inhibits the RAF1-mediated signalling pathway and AP-1 activity. In the syngeneic 4T1 breast cancer model, LPIN1 overexpression increased tumour development, whereas inhibition of LPIN1 and IRS1 suppressed it. Consistent with these observations, LPIN1 levels were positively correlated with IRS1 expression in human breast cancer. Thus, our results indicate a mechanism by which IRS1 expression is increased in breast cancer, and LPIN1 may be a promising drug target for anticancer therapy.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene characterized as a phosphatase that antagonizes the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway in the cytoplasm. Nuclear PTEN plays roles in chromosomal stability, in which the double-strand breaks (DSB) repair mediated by homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is critical. Herein, the role of nuclear PTEN in DSB repair and the underlying molecular mechanism was investigated in this study. Using human breast cancer BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, we reveal a specific feature of PTEN that controls poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of Ku70 and interferes with binding of Ku70 at DSB. Plasmid-based end joining and reporter assays showed that nuclear PTEN restrained NHEJ efficacy. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that nuclear PTEN impaired Ku70 complex binding to DSB by 3-fold. Co-immunoprecipitation assay showed PTEN regulated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of Ku70 instead of directly interacting with Ku70, while PTEN promoted the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP1 and induced the degradation of PARP1 in PTEN-WT cells exposed to DSB agents. Of note, the role of PTEN in DSB repair mostly depends on its nuclear localization rather than its phosphatase activity. As a result, the absence of nuclear PTEN rather than phosphatase-negative PTEN confers cell hypersensitivity to anti-tumor DNA damage drugs. This finding contributes to understanding the effect of PTEN in repair of DSB and using defined anti-tumor DSB drugs to treat tumor cells with aberrant PTEN.
CYP2C19 and P2Y12 polymorphisms have been claimed to alter the pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel. ABCB1 polymorphism has been associated with the efflux of clopidogrel resulting in decreased bioavailability. Due to paucity of data from Indian population, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the association of genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C19, P2Y12, and ABCB1 with inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by clopidogrel.
ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) is the principal protein responsible for cellular cholesterol efflux. Abundance and functionality of ABCA1 is regulated both transcriptionally and post-translationally, with endocytosis of ABCA1 being an important element of post-translational regulation. Functional ABCA1 resides on the plasma membrane but can be internalized and either degraded or recycled back to the plasma membrane. The interaction between the degradative and recycling pathways determines the abundance of ABCA1 and may contribute to the efflux of intracellular cholesterol.
SLC7A10 (Asc-1) is a sodium-independent amino acid transporter known to facilitate transport of a number of amino acids including glycine, L-serine, L-alanine, and L-cysteine, as well as their D-enantiomers. It has been described as a neuronal transporter with a primary role related to modulation of excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission. We find that SLC7A10 is substantially enriched in a subset of astrocytes of the caudal brain and spinal cord in a distribution corresponding with high densities of glycinergic inhibitory synapses. Accordingly, we find that spinal cord glycine levels are significantly reduced in Slc7a10-null mice and spontaneous glycinergic postsynaptic currents in motor neurons show substantially diminished amplitudes, demonstrating an essential role for SLC7A10 in glycinergic inhibitory function in the central nervous system. These observations establish the etiology of sustained myoclonus (sudden involuntary muscle movements) and early postnatal lethality characteristic of Slc7a10-null mice, and implicate SLC7A10 as a candidate gene and auto-antibody target in human hyperekplexia and stiff person syndrome, respectively.
KMT2A mutations cause Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WDSTS), which is characterized by hypertrichosis cubiti, short stature, and distinct facial features in general. Here, we report two Chinese boys with novel nonsense KMT2A mutations. Most of their phenotypes are concordant with WDSTS. They, however, lack the key WDSTS feature-hypertrichosis cubiti. Additionally, their transverse palmar creases are absent. We further summarized the genotypes and phenotypes of the KMT2A mutation carriers. The consensus phenotypes include postnatal growth retardation, developmental delay, short stature, and intellectual disability. The common facial features include thick eyebrows, long eyelashes, downslanting, and narrow palpebral fissures, wide nasal bridge, and broad nasal tip. They have generalized hypertrichosis. A hairy back can be observed as frequently as hairy elbows in patients with KMT2A mutations. Absent palmar proximal transverse creases are only observed in these two Chinese boys. This might be due to the difference in ethnic background. Thus far, all mutations in KMT2A are located before the FYRC domain. They would truncate KMT2A mRNA transcripts. Haploinsufficiency of the histone methyltransferase activity would therefore influence transcriptional regulation. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
AMPD1 is an adenosine monophosphate deaminase that catalyzes the deamination of AMP to IMP. To understand the physiological function of AMPD1, we obtained a strain of Ampd1 mutant mice from KOMP repository, which was generated by a knockout-first strategy. An elevated AMP level and almost complete lack of IMP was detected in the skeletal muscle of E18.5 Ampd1
ABCG2 belongs to the superfamily of ATP binding cassette (ABC) proteins and is associated with the limited success of anticancer chemotherapy, given its responsibility for the cross-resistance of tumor cells, known as multidrug resistance (MDR). Several classes of ABCG2 inhibitors were developed for increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy. A series of chalcones coupled to an additional aromatic residue was synthesized and investigated for their inhibition of ABC transporters. In our previous work we determined the preferred position of the linker on the A-ring to be ortho, and found several substitution patterns at the additional ring that improved potency. In this study we investigated whether a methoxy group that improved the inhibitory activity of chalcones would also be beneficial for the acryloylphenylcarboxamide scaffold. Indeed, this modification led to highly potent ABCG2 inhibitors. To support the hypothesis of a beneficial effect of the amide linker, six acryloylphenylcarboxylates were synthesized and investigated for their inhibitory activity. Replacement of the amide linker with an ester group resulted in decreased inhibition. Molecular modeling showed that the conformational preference of both series differs, thereby explaining the positive effect of the amide linker. Several compounds were characterized in detail by investigating their intrinsic cytotoxicity and capacity to reverse MDR in MTT assays and their effect on vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity.
CYP2C9 is one of the major drug metabolizing enzymes, however, little is known about polymorphisms in CYP2C9 gene and pharmacological implications in Mexican indigenous populations. Thus, frequencies of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles were evaluated in indigenous groups located in northwest (Cora), center (Mazahua and Teenek), south (Chatino and Mixteco) and southeast (Chontal and Maya) regions Mexico.
RBP4 is produced mainly by hepatocytes. In type 2 diabetes and obesity, circulating RBP4 is increased and may act systemically to cause insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Observations that adipocyte RBP4 mRNA increases in parallel with circulating RBP4 in these conditions, whereas liver RBP4 mRNA does not, led to a widely held hypothesis that elevated circulating RBP4 is a direct result of increased production by adipocytes. To test this, we generated mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of RBP4 (liver RBP4 knockout or LRKO mice). Adipose tissue RBP4 expression and secretion remained intact in LRKO mice and increased as expected in the setting of diet-induced insulin resistance. However, circulating RBP4 was undetectable in LRKO mice. We conclude that adipocyte RBP4 is not a significant source of circulating RBP4, even in the setting of insulin resistance. Adipocyte RBP4, therefore, may have a more important autocrine or paracrine function that is confined within the adipose tissue compartment.
"CLC anion channels are homodimeric proteins. Each subunit is comprised of 18 α-helices designated ""A-R"" and an intracellular carboxy-terminus containing two cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS1 and CBS2) domains. Conformational coupling between membrane and intracellular domains via poorly understood mechanisms is required for CLC regulation. The activity of the C. elegans CLC channel CLH-3b is reduced by phosphorylation of a carboxy-terminus ""activation domain,"" which disrupts its interaction with CBS domains. CBS2 interfaces with a short intracellular loop, the H-I loop, connecting membrane helices H and I. Alanine mutation of a conserved H-I loop tyrosine residue, Y232, prevents regulation demonstrating that the loop functions to couple phosphorylation-dependent CBS domain conformational changes to channel membrane domains. To gain further insight into the mechanisms of this coupling, we mutated conserved amino acid residues in membrane helices H and I. Only mutation of the H-helix valine residue V228 to leucine prevented phosphorylation-dependent channel regulation. Structural and functional studies of other CLC proteins suggest that V228 may interact with Y529, a conserved R-helix tyrosine residue that forms part of the CLC ion conduction pathway. Mutation of Y529 to alanine also prevented CLH-3b regulation. Intracellular application of the sulfhydryl reactive reagent MTSET using CLH-3b channels engineered with single-cysteine residues in CBS2 indicate that V228L, Y529A, and Y232A disrupt putative regulatory intracellular conformational changes.

NQO1 is a dimeric flavoprotein which intimately associated with cancer and overexpressed in the cytosol of numerous human tumor cells. Given that the cellular environment is quite dynamic and versatile, further investigation of the function of NQO1 depends on tools for specific detection of it. Currently, several activity-based assays have been developed to detect NQO1-expressing cancerous tissues. Herein, we report the development of a functional affinity-based small-molecule probe which is composed of a potent small-molecule NQO1 inhibitor 3d as the recognition group, a linker and the fluorophores group FITC. The probe exhibits good inhibitory activity of NQO1 and has been successfully used to label the protein in A549 cells at the micromolar level. These features make the probe favorable for mechanistic studies and cancer diagnostic biomarker. Based on these preliminary results, our laboratory will focus on the further development of fluorescent probe for NQO1, which could be anticipated to be applied in physiological and pathological studies of NQO1.
GNE myopathy is an autosomal recessive distal myopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in the GNE gene, which encodes UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase (GNE), a key enzyme in sialic-acid biosynthesis. By comprehensive screening of manifesting patients using a fine-mapped targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), we identified copy number variations (CNVs) in 13 patients from 11 unrelated families. The nine unique CNVs largely vary in size from 0.3 to 72 kb. Over half of the cases carry different deletions spanning merely exon 2, which contains the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the muscle major transcript hGNE1. Of most unique CNVs, either the telomeric or the centromeric breakpoint locates within intron 2, indicating rearrangement hotspots. Haplotype analysis suggested the existence of a founder allele with exon 2 deletion. The breakpoints for all CNVs were determined by long-range PCR and sequencing. All of the breakpoints of gross deletion/duplications reside within directly oriented pairs of Alu repeats. The results of this study firstly widen the spectra of mutations to CNVs encompassing 5'UTR, underscoring the pivotal role of the hGNE1 transcript. Alu-mediated non-recurrent CNVs may have been overlooked in a wide variety of recessive phenotypes, especially in those associated with genomic Alu-rich genes such as GNE.
CFTR is implicated in cutaneous wound healing although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In other cell types, CFTR is reported to regulate MAPK/ NF-κB signaling. We undertook the present study to explore a possible role of CFTR in regulating MAPK/NF-κB during cutaneous wound healing. Methods&amp; Results: The splint-excisional and incisional wound healing models were used in CFTR mutant (DF508) mice. The cell-scratch model was used in a human keratinocyte line, HaCaT, in conjunction with CFTR knockdown or overexpression. The epidermal inflammation, keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, as well as MAPK/NF-κB signaling were examined. Inhibitors of MAPK/NF-κB were also used.
CNDP1 gene, present on chromosome 18q22.3-23, encodes carnosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in hydrolysis of carnosine to ß-alanine and L-histidine. Linkage of CTG trinucleotide (leucine) repeat polymorphism in CNDP1 gene with diabetic nephropathy has been observed in several populations. However, this association is conflicting and population-dependent. We investigated this association in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with and without nephropathy in north India.
ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, ABCB1/MDR1) is one of the major members of the ABC transporters linked to MDR in cancer cells. In this study, we observed that pristimerin, a natural triterpenoid, potently decreased P-gp in a dose-dependent manner in both drug-resistant KBv200 and stable transfected HEK293/ABCB1 cell lines. Moreover, pristimerin also inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in both cell lines. Intriguingly, reverse transcription-PCR, real-time PCR and protein turn-over assay revealed that the decrease of P-gp was independent of mRNA level but primarily owing to its protein stability. Furthermore, immunofluorescence study with anti-P-gp antibody showed that pristimerin disturbed the subcellular distribution of P-gp with decreased location in the plasma membrane. Taken together, these data suggest that subcellular distribution of P-gp and subsequent downregulation by pristimerin contribute to overcoming ABCB1-mediated chemotherapeutic drug resistance. Our findings suggested inducing the decrease of P-gp membrane protein could be a new promising alternative therapeutic strategy in ABCB1-mediated MDR.
LPL hydrolyzes triglycerides in plasma lipoproteins. Due to the complex regulation mechanism, it has been difficult to mimic the physiological conditions under which LPL acts in vitro. We demonstrate that isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), using human plasma as substrate, overcomes several limitations of previously used techniques. The high sensitivity of ITC allows continuous recording of the heat released during hydrolysis. Both initial rates and kinetics for complete hydrolysis of plasma lipids can be studied. The heat rate was shown to correspond to the release of fatty acids and was linearly related to the amount of added enzyme, either purified LPL or postheparin plasma. Addition of apoC-III reduced the initial rate of hydrolysis by LPL, but the inhibition became less prominent with time when the lipoproteins were triglyceride poor. Addition of angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL)3 or ANGPTL4 caused reduction of the activity of LPL via a two-step mechanism. We conclude that ITC can be used for quantitative measurements of LPL activity and interactions under in vivo-like conditions, for comparisons of the properties of plasma samples from patients and control subjects as substrates for LPL, as well as for testing of drug candidates developed with the aim to affect the LPL system.
AKR1C3 is a promising drug target for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Here, 3D-QSAR analysis were performed on 3-(3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-ylsulfonyl)benzoic acids to correlate their chemical structures with their observed AKR1C3 inhibitory activity. Three structural alignment methods employing various conformers were used to scrutinize the effect of conformation selection on the predictive accuracy of QSAR models. Using docked conformation, the best CoMFA and CoMSIA models were developed and validated with a training set of 61 molecules and a test set of 7 molecules. Detailed analysis of contour maps provided helpful structural insights to rational design of AKR1C3 inhibitors with enhanced potency.
CAD is a well-established comorbidity associated with HIV infection. This association is in large part due to ongoing inflammation propagated by viremia and dysregulation of the immune system. Despite this knowledge, evidence to guide clinical management and screening for CAD among HIV-infected patients is lacking. The following editorial discusses recent evidence that HIV-infected patients with abnormal cardiovascular stress testing are more likely to undergo subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention. Importantly, the cardiovascular consequences of HIV infection and potential clinical implications are discussed.
GNE Myopathy (GNEM) is a progressive adult-onset myopathy likely caused by deficiency of sialic acid (SA) biosynthesis.
ABCG2 encodes the mitoxantrone resistance protein (MXR; breast cancer resistance protein), an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux membrane transporter. Computational analysis of the ∼300 kb region of DNA surrounding ABCG2 (chr4:88911376-89220011, hg19) identified 30 regions with potential cis-regulatory capabilities. These putative regulatory regions were tested for their enhancer and suppressor activity in a human liver cell line using luciferase reporter assays. The in vitro enhancer and suppressor assays identified four regions that decreased gene expression and five regions that increased expression >1.6-fold. Four of five human hepatic in vitro enhancers were confirmed as in vivo liver enhancers using the mouse hydrodynamic tail vein injection assay. Two of the in vivo liver enhancers (ABCG2RE1 and ABCG2RE9) responded to 17β-estradiol or rifampin in human cell lines, and ABCG2RE9 had ChIP-seq evidence to support the binding of several transcription factors and the transcriptional coactivator p300 in human hepatocytes. This study identified genomic regions surrounding human ABCG2 that can function as regulatory elements, some with the capacity to alter gene expression upon environmental stimulus. The results from this research will drive future investigations of interindividual variation in ABCG2 expression and function that contribute to differences in drug response.
GNE myopathy is a rare autosomal recessively inherited muscle disease resulting from mutations in the gene encoding GNE (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase), a key enzyme in sialic acid biosynthesis. 154 different pathogenic variants have been previously associated with GNE myopathy.
GNE myopathy (previous names: HIBM, DMRV, IBM2) is a unique distal myopathy with quadriceps sparing. This recessively inherited myopathy has been diagnosed in various regions of the world with more than 150 disease-causing mutations already identified. Several of those are proven or suspected to be founder mutations in certain regional clusters and are described in this review. The review also discusses some historical aspects that might be relevant to the mutational distribution.
CYP2B6 is a polymorphic detoxification gene which plays a vital role in the degradation of genotoxic compounds. In this study we hypothesized that inadequate detoxification due to CYP2B6 polymorphisms may contribute to AML. To evaluate the potential impact of CYP2B6 polymorphisms on AML development and induction of its specific chromosomal abnormalities we studied C
CYP2D6 is an important cytochrome P450 enzyme that plays an important role in the metabolism of about 25% of currently prescribed drugs. The presence of polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene may modulate enzyme level and activity, thereby affecting individual responses to pharmacological treatments. The most prevalent diseases in the admixed population from Venezuela are cardiovascular and cancer, whereas viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases, particularly malaria, are prevalent in Amerindian populations; in the treatment of these diseases, several drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 are used. In this work, we reviewed the data on CYP2D6 variability and predicted metabolizer phenotypes, in healthy volunteers of two admixed and five Amerindian populations from Venezuela. The Venezuelan population is very heterogeneous as a result of the genetic admixture of three major ethnical components: Europeans, Africans and Amerindians. There are noticeable inter-regional and inter-population differences in the process of mixing of this population. Hitherto, there are few published studies in Venezuela on CYP2D6; therefore, it is necessary to increase research in this regard, in particular to develop studies with a larger sample size. There is a considerable amount of work remaining before CYP2D6 is integrated into clinical practice in Venezuela.
SDHB mutations are linked to the familial paraganglioma syndrome type 4 (PGL4), which is associated with predominantly extra-adrenal disease and has high metastatic rates. Despite the lower penetrance rates in carriers of SDHB mutations compared to mutations in other paraganglioma susceptibility genes, the aggressive behavior of SDHB-linked disease warrants intensive surveillance to identify and resect tumors early. Patients with similar SDHB genotypes in whom the PGL syndrome manifests often exhibit very heterogeneous phenotypes. Tumors can arise in various locations, and management can be considerably different, depending on tumor site and pathology. We present a case series of five SDHB mutation carriers over four generations from the same family to illustrate the complexities in management.
ABAT deficiency (OMIM 613163) is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by recessive variants in the gene 4-aminobutyric acid transaminase (ABAT), which is responsible for both the catalysis of GABA and maintenance of nucleoside pools in the mitochondria. To date, only a few patients have been reported worldwide. Their clinical presentation has been remarkably consistent with primary features of severe psychomotor retardation, encephalopathy, hypotonia, and infantile-onset refractory epilepsy. We report a new case of ABAT deficiency that marks an important departure from previous clinical findings. The patient presented at age 6 months with global developmental delay, hypotonia, hypersomnolence and mild choreiform movements. At age 18 months, the subject's clinical presentation was still milder than all previously reported patients and, most notably, did not include seizures. Clinical whole exome sequencing revealed two heterozygous ABAT missense variants that are rare and predicted damaging, but never before reported in a patient and were reported as variants of unknown significance. To test the potential pathogenicity of the variants identified in this patient we developed a cell-based system to test both functions of the ABAT protein via GABA transaminase enzyme activity and mtDNA copy number assays. This systematic approach was validated using vigabatrin, the irreversible inhibitor of ABAT, and leveraged to test the functionality of all ABAT variants in previously reported patients plus the variants in this new case. This work confirmed the novel variants compromised ABAT function to similar levels as variants in previously characterized cases with more severe clinical presentation, thereby confirming the molecular diagnosis of this patient. Additionally, functional studies conducted in cells from both mild and severe patient fibroblasts showed similar levels of compromise in mitochondrial membrane potential, respiratory capacity, ATP production and mtDNA depletion. These results illustrate how cell-based functional studies can aid in the diagnosis of a rare, neurological disorder. Importantly, this patient marks an expansion in the clinical phenotype for ABAT deficiency to a milder presentation that is more commonly seen in pediatric genetics and neurology clinics.
NT5E encodes ecto-5'-nucleotidase (e5NT, CD73) which hydrolyses extracellular AMP to adenosine. Adenosine has been shown to play a protective role against aortic valve calcification (AVC). We identified two nonsynonymous missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (c.1126A > G, p.T376A and c.1136T > C, p.M379T) in exon 6 of the human NT5E gene. Since both substitutions might affect e5NT activity and consequently alter extracellular adenosine levels, we evaluated the association between NT5E alleles and calcific aortic valve disease in 119 patients (95 patients with AVC and 24 controls). In AVC patients, the frequency of the G allele at c.1126 and the frequency of the GG genotype as well as the frequency of the C allele at c.1136, and the frequencies of CC and TC genotypes tended to be higher as compared to controls. The allele and genotype frequencies in AVC patients and controls were also compared to those calculated from the 1000 Genomes Project data for control individuals of European ancestry (n = 503). We found that the frequency of the C allele at c.1136 is significantly higher in patients with AVC than in the European controls (0.111 vs. 0.054, P = 0.0052). Moreover, e5NT activity in aortic valves showed a trend toward lower levels in AVC patients with CC and TC genotypes than in those with the TT genotype. Our findings indicate that the genetic polymorphism of NT5E may contribute to the pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease and that the C allele of SNP c.1136 is associated with an increased risk of AVC.
FABP4 is widely expressed in both normal and pathologic tissues. It promotes cell proliferation, survival and migration of endothelial cells, and therefore, angiogenesis. However, the role of FABP4 in hemangioma or hemangioma endothelial cells (HemECs) has not been explored. In this study, we investigated whether FABP4 directly regulates the proliferation of HemECs. The expression of cell cycle checkpoint genes was analyzed with the microarray data of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDVECs) and infantile hemangioma endothelial cells. Real-time RT-PCR and western blotting were used to examine the expression of FABP4 in HemECs. Next, the FABP4 expression was inhibited in HemECs using siRNA or rapamycin and upregulated using retroviral transduction of HemECs to assess its influence on proliferation of HemECs. The microarray data showed that cell cycle checkpoint genes were upregulated in HemECs. Moreover, HemECs showed significantly higher proliferation rates than HDVECs. The expression of FABP4 and mTOR was increased in the HemECs. While FABP4 knockdown reduced the BrdU incorporation and cell number of HemECs as expected, cell proliferation was accelerated by FABP4 over-expression. Moreover, rapamycin (10nM) inhibited mTOR-FABP4 signaling and HemEC proliferation. Taken together, these results indicated that mTOR signaling pathway-activated FABP4 directly regulates the proliferation of endothelial cells in hemangioma. Rapamycin and inhibitors of FABP4 have therapeutic potential for treating infantile hemangiomas.
CD36 is implicated in fatty-acid uptake in multiple tissues, including hepatocytes and adipocytes. Circulating CD36 (sCD36) is increased in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We explored this association further by investigating correlations between sCD36 levels, intrahepatic lipid content and markers of obesity in NAFLD patients and controls.
CYP3A4 and P-gp together form a highly efficient barrier for orally absorbed drugs and always share the same substrates. Our previous work revealed that chrysosplenetin (CHR) significantly augmented the rat plasma level and anti-malarial efficacy of artemisinin (ART), partially due to the uncompetitive inhibition effect of CHR on rat CYP3A. But the impact of CHR on P-gp is still unknown.
CD38 is an ectoenzyme that catalyzes the conversion of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (β-NAD) to cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose (cADPR) and adenosine diphosphoribose (ADPR) and NADP to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) and adenosine diphosphoribose-2'-phosphate (ADPR-P). The metabolites of NAD and NADP have roles in calcium signaling in different cell types including airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. In ASM cells, inflammatory cytokines augment CD38 expression and to a greater magnitude in cells from asthmatics, indicating a greater capacity for the generation of cADPR and ADPR in ASM from asthmatics. CD38 deficient mice develop attenuated airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine following allergen sensitization and challenge compared to wild-type mice indicating its potential role in asthma. Regulation of CD38 expression in ASM cells is achieved by mitogen activated protein kinases, specific isoforms of PI3 kinases, the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1, and post-transcriptionally by microRNAs. This review will focus on the role of CD38 in intracellular calcium regulation in ASM, contribution to airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in mouse models of allergic airway inflammation, the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms of regulation of expression, and outline approaches to inhibit its expression and activity.
LCAT synthesizes most of the plasma cholesteryl esters, and plays a major role in HDL metabolism. Mutations in the LCAT gene cause two syndromes, familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) and fish-eye disease (FED), both characterized by severe alterations in plasma lipoprotein profile. Renal disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in FLD cases, but an established therapy is not currently available. The present therapy of LCAT deficiency is mainly aimed at correcting the dyslipidemia associated with the disease and at delaying evolution of chronic nephropathy. LCAT deficiency represents a candidate disease for enzyme replacement therapy. In vitro and in vivo studies proved the efficacy of recombinant human LCAT (rhLCAT) in correcting dyslipidemia, and rhLCAT is presently under development.
CBS (Conyza blinii saponin) is the total triterpenoidal saponins of Conyza blinii H.Lév which is a type of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). We have discovered that CBS has a profound cytostatic activity against a range of solid tumour cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We also confirm that the cytostatic activity of CBS originates from its apoptosis induction effect. Additionally, we use immunoblot to find out that the apoptosis induction effect of CBS is attributable to the activation of mitochondrial pathway. Mechanistic study demonstrates that CBS is an effective NF-κB inhibitor. It inhibits p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB downstream gene expression, including XIAP, survivin, Bcl-xL, COX-2, cyclin D1, MMP-2, MMP-9 in HeLa cells. Tumour xenografted animal models verify the anti-cancer efficacy in vivo. Tumour growth is significantly repressed in two CBS-treated groups compared with the controls (P < 0.001). CBS treatment (i.g.) leads to a 48.5% and 57.0% reduction in terms of tumour weight for the 10 and 20 mg/kg dosed groups respectively. Also no apparent observable adverse effects can be seen. These results suggest that CBS obliterate tumour, at least in part due to its NF-κB inhibition, which creates potential for CBS to be developed as a practical cancer treatment.
ABO blood groups have been confirmed to be associated with cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease. However, whether ABO blood group is correlated with coronary artery calcium (CAC) is still unknown.
MDH2 encodes mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH), which is essential for the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate as part of the proper functioning of the Krebs cycle. We report bi-allelic pathogenic mutations in MDH2 in three unrelated subjects presenting with early-onset generalized hypotonia, psychomotor delay, refractory epilepsy, and elevated lactate in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Functional studies in fibroblasts from affected subjects showed both an apparently complete loss of MDH2 levels and MDH2 enzymatic activity close to null. Metabolomics analyses demonstrated a significant concomitant accumulation of the MDH substrate, malate, and fumarate, its immediate precursor in the Krebs cycle, in affected subjects' fibroblasts. Lentiviral complementation with wild-type MDH2 cDNA restored MDH2 levels and mitochondrial MDH activity. Additionally, introduction of the three missense mutations from the affected subjects into Saccharomyces cerevisiae provided functional evidence to support their pathogenicity. Disruption of the Krebs cycle is a hallmark of cancer, and MDH2 has been recently identified as a novel pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma susceptibility gene. We show that loss-of-function mutations in MDH2 are also associated with severe neurological clinical presentations in children.
SI is a significant medical problem. DFA-02 is an investigational bioresorbable modified release gel consisting of both gentamicin (16.8 mg/mL) and vancomycin (18.8 mg/mL). A Phase 2a study, where the drug was applied during surgical incision closure, suggested safety and tolerability but was not designed to assess its efficacy.
TUSC3 was recently identified as a potential tumor suppressor gene in a variety of human malignancies. However, no data are currently available regarding the expressions of TUSC3 in esophageal cancer (ESCC).The purposes of this study was to investigated the expressions of TUSC3 in ESCC tissues and assess the relationship between TUSC3 levels and clinico-pathological characteristics of ESCC patients. TUSC3 protein expressions were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue microarray slides in esophageal cancer, which included 95 esophageal squamous carcinoma specimens (ESCC), and 75 normal esophageal mucosa (NEM). We found that TUSC3 in ESCC was significant lower than that in NEM (P=0.000). According to multi-clinical classifications, TUSC3 level varied significantly with TNM stage, T stage, and N stage (p<0.001, p=0.0368, p<0.0001, respectively). Univariate analysis showed that gender, TNM stage, T stage, N stage, TUSC3 expression were prognostic factors for survival. Multivariate analysis showed that in our study, only TUSC3 expression was independent prognostic factors for ESCC. Our results indicated for the first time, a combined analysis of TUSC3 expressions as well as the clinical variables will help predict the prognosis of ESCC patients. Further large-sample validation and functional analysis should be performed to evaluate its potential prognostic and therapeutic values for ESCC patients.
CAT IV regimen or the standardized drug regimen (SDR) under the Revised National Control Program (RNTCP) uses six second-line anti-tubercular drugs in the initial intensive phase (IP). These drugs have many side effects and toxicity; they are less efficacious and have poor acceptability. The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and outcome of Cat-IV regimen and the factors which influence the treatment outcome in MDR TB patients.
MTHFR C677T is a common gene polymorphism that has been shown to be associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. Studies on the role of MTHFR in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have yielded conflicting results, perhaps due in part to genetic heterogeneity. The prevalence of the MTHFR C677T variant allele varies according to Jewish subpopulations: Ashkenazi vs non-Ashkenazi. The aim of this study was to examine the association between MTHFR C677T genotype and IBD in the different Jewish populations.DNA samples were assessed for the presence of the MTHFR C677T variant allele in 445 Jewish Israeli IBD patients: 338 with Crohn's disease [CD] (214 Ashkenazi and 124 non-Ashkenazi Jews) and 107 with ulcerative colitis [UC] (73 Ashkenazi and 34 non-Ashkenazi Jews), and in 347 healthy controls: 173 Ashkenazi and 174 Non-Ashkenazi Jews. Possible genotype-phenotype associations were investigated.We showed a significantly higher frequency of MTHFR 677T variant genotypes in non-Ashkenazi CD patients: Odds ratio of 1.86 for heterozygotes (CT) and 2.89 for homozygotes (TT) compared to non-Ashkenazi healthy controls. No significant association was found for UC in non-Ashkenazi patients or for CD or UC in Ashkenazi patients.Our findings suggest that the MTHFR 677T variant may contribute to the risk of CD in non-Ashkenazi but not Ashkenazi Jews. This may result from genetic heterogeneity and highlights the complexity of the genetic etiology of IBD.

PTEN loss and constitutive activation of the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway are key drivers of endometrial tumorigenesis. In some cancer types, PTEN-deficient tumors are reliant on class I PI3K p110β (encoded by PIK3CB) activity but little is known about this contribution in endometrial tumorigenesis. In this study, we find that p110β is overexpressed in a panel of 7 endometrial cancer cell lines compared to non-transformed cells. Furthermore, in 234 clinically annotated patient samples, PIK3CB mRNA levels increase significantly in the early phase of tumorigenesis from precursors to low grade primary malignant lesions whereas PIK3CA levels are higher in non-endometrioid compared to endometrioid primary tumors. While high levels of either PIK3CA or PIK3CB associate with poor prognosis, only elevated PIK3CB mRNA levels correlate with a high cell cycle signature score in clinical samples. In cancer cell lines, p110α inhibition reduces cell viability by inducing cell death in PIK3CA mutant cells while p110β inhibition delayed proliferation in PTEN-deficient cells, but not in WT cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that PIK3CB/p110β contributes to some of the pleiotropic functions of PI3K in endometrial cancer, particularly in the early steps by contributing to cell proliferation.
ABCB4 (MDR3) is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter expressed at the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, where it mediates phosphatidylcholine (PC) secretion. Variations in the ABCB4 gene are responsible for several biliary diseases, including progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3), a rare disease that can be lethal in the absence of liver transplantation. In this study, we investigated the effect and potential rescue of ABCB4 missense variations that reside in the highly conserved motifs of ABC transporters, involved in ATP binding. Five disease-causing variations in these motifs have been identified in ABCB4 (G535D, G536R, S1076C, S1176L, and G1178S), three of which are homologous to the gating mutations of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR or ABCC7; i.e., G551D, S1251N, and G1349D), that were previously shown to be function defective and corrected by ivacaftor (VX-770; Kalydeco), a clinically approved CFTR potentiator. Three-dimensional structural modeling predicted that all five ABCB4 variants would disrupt critical interactions in the binding of ATP and thereby impair ATP-induced nucleotide-binding domain dimerization and ABCB4 function. This prediction was confirmed by expression in cell models, which showed that the ABCB4 mutants were normally processed and targeted to the plasma membrane, whereas their PC secretion activity was dramatically decreased. As also hypothesized on the basis of molecular modeling, PC secretion activity of the mutants was rescued by the CFTR potentiator, ivacaftor (VX-770).
ABO subtypes and RhD variants are the most studied blood groups in China. Some of the polymorphisms in these two blood groups have direct clinical relevance. Molecular diagnosis of blood group polymorphisms is underway in China. In addition, research groups have developed methods such as screening for blood group mimetic peptides using phage display technology. New reagents, akin to antibodies directed against RhD and ABO, are being investigated using aptamer-based techniques. Progress is also being made in the development of synthetic exoglycosidases for conversion of group A and/or B antigens to group O. Development of methoxy-polyethylene-glycol modified red cells has been successful in vitro but has not reached clinical application. In this paper, we summarize red cell immunohematology research that has been conducted in China.
ABO blood typing in pre-transfusion testing is a major component of the high workload in blood banks that therefore requires automation. We often experienced discrepant results from an automated system, especially weak serum reactions. We evaluated the discrepant results by the reference manual method to confirm ABO blood typing.
ALDH3A1 is a corneal crystallin that protects ocular tissues from ultraviolet radiation through catalytic and non-catalytic functions. In addition, ALDH3A1 plays a functional role in corneal epithelial homeostasis by simultaneously modulating proliferation and differentiation. We have previously shown that Aldh3a1 knockout mice in a C57B6/129sV mixed genetic background develop lens cataracts. In the current study, we evaluated the corneal phenotype of Aldh3a1 knockout mice bred into a C57B/6J congenic background (KO). In vivo confocal microscopy examination of KO and wild-type (WT) corneas revealed KO mice to exhibit corneal haze, manifesting marked light scattering from corneal stroma. This corneal phenotype was further characterized by Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS) with spatial resolution that revealed a trilayer structure based on differential lipid localization. In these preliminary studies, no differences were observed in lipid profiles from KO relative to WT mice; however, changes in protein profiles of acyl-CoA binding protein (m/z 9966) and histone H4.4 (m/z 11308) were found to be increased in the corneal epithelial layer of KO mice. This is the first study to use IMS to characterize endogenous proteins and lipids in corneal tissue and to molecularly explore the corneal haze phenotype. Taken together, the current study presents the first genetic animal model of cellular-induced corneal haze due to the loss of a corneal crystallin, and strongly supports the notion that ALDH3A1 is critical to cellular transparency. Finally, IMS represents a valuable new approach to reveal molecular changes underlying corneal disease.
PDE10A is a cAMP/cGMP phosphodiesterase important in signal transduction within medium spiny neurons of the human striatum. This gene region has been associated with bipolar disorder via case-control and linkage studies. The three most studied human PDE10A isoforms differ in both their N-termini and trafficking within the cell with PDE10A2 found predominantly at the plasma membrane and PDE10A1 and PDE10A19 remaining primarily within the cytosol. RNA-sequencing and 5' RLM-RACE studies of the human putamen and caudate nucleus revealed 16 new exons and 12 novel transcripts of PDE10A, 3 of which are predicted to produce proteins with unique N-termini. The novel first exons of these transcripts are highly conserved in non-human primate species and are rarely found in other mammals. One hundred and eight previously classified intronic SNPs were found within the novel PDE10A exons of which 78% were classified as rare variants. Since most of the rare variants localize to 5' UTR regions, they may influence PDE10A transcription, translation, or mRNA stability. Dysregulation of cAMP signaling has been proposed as a cause of bipolar disorder and PDE10A inhibitors have been investigated as potential therapeutics for schizophrenia. Understanding the mechanisms contributing to PDE10A expression in the human striatum may provide evidence linking this gene to the phenotypes observed in neuropsychiatric disorders.
"SMYD3 plays a key role in cancer cell viability, adhesion, migration and invasion. SMYD3 promotes formation of inducible regulatory T cells and is involved in reducing autoimmunity. However, the nearly ""closed"" substrate-binding site and poor in vitro H3K4 methyltransferase activity have obscured further understanding of this oncogenically related protein. Here we reveal that SMYD3 can adopt an ""open"" conformation using molecular dynamics simulation and small-angle X-ray scattering. This ligand-binding-capable open state is related to the crystal structure-like closed state by a striking clamshell-like inter-lobe dynamics. The two states are characterized by many distinct structural and dynamical differences and the conformational transition pathway is mediated by a reversible twisting motion of the C-terminal domain (CTD). The spontaneous transition from the closed to open states suggests two possible, mutually non-exclusive models for SMYD3 functional regulation and the conformational selection mechanism and allostery may regulate the catalytic or ligand binding competence of SMYD3. This study provides an immediate clue to the puzzling role of SMYD3 in epigenetic gene regulation."
FABP4 is a protein primarily expressed in adipocytes and macrophages that plays a key role in fatty acid trafficking and lipid hydrolysis. FABP4 gene polymorphisms have been associated with meat quality traits in cattle, mostly in Asian breeds under feedlot conditions. The objectives of this work were to characterize FABP4 genetic variation in several worldwide cattle breeds and evaluate possible genotype effects on fat content in a pasture-fed crossbred (Angus-Hereford-Limousin) population. We re-sequenced 43 unrelated animals from nine cattle breeds (Angus, Brahman, Creole, Hereford, Holstein, Limousin, Nelore, Shorthorn, and Wagyu) and obtained 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) over 3,164 bp, including four novel polymorphisms. Haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium analyses showed a high variability. Five SNPs were selected to perform validation and association studies in our crossbred population. Four SNPs showed well-balanced allele frequencies (minor frequency > 0.159), and three showed no significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions. SNPs showed significant effects on backfat thickness and fatty acid composition (P < 0.05). The protein structure of one of the missense SNPs was analyzed to elucidate its possible effect on fat content in our studied population. Our results revealed a possible blockage of the fatty acid binding site by the missense mutation.
CD36 has immuno-metabolic actions and is abundant in the small intestine on epithelial, endothelial and immune cells. We examined the role of CD36 in gut homeostasis using mice null for CD36 (CD36KO) and with CD36 deletion specific to enterocytes (Ent-CD36KO) or endothelial cells (EC-CD36KO).
CFTR is a transmembrane protein that reaches the cell surface via the conventional Golgi mediated secretion pathway. Interestingly, ER-to-Golgi blockade or ER stress induces alternative GRASP-mediated, Golgi-bypassing unconventional trafficking of wild-type CFTR and the disease-causing ΔF508-CFTR, which has folding and trafficking defects. Here, we show that Sec16A, the key regulator of conventional ER-to-Golgi transport, plays a critical role in the ER exit of protein cargos during unconventional secretion. In an initial gene silencing screen, Sec16A knockdown abolished the unconventional secretion of wild-type and ΔF508-CFTR induced by ER-to-Golgi blockade, whereas the knockdown of other COPII-related components did not. Notably, during unconventional secretion, Sec16A was redistributed to cell periphery and associated with GRASP55 in mammalian cells. Molecular and morphological analyses revealed that IRE1α-mediated signaling is an upstream regulator of Sec16A during ER-to-Golgi blockade or ER stress associated unconventional secretion. These findings highlight a novel function of Sec16A as an essential mediator of ER stress-associated unconventional secretion.
PIK3CA mutations are expected to be potential therapeutic targets for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We aimed to clarify the concordance between PIK3CA mutations detected in endoscopic biopsy specimens and corresponding surgically resected specimens.
CYP2E1 polymorphisms have been reported to influence individual's breast cancer susceptibility as a phase I enzyme, but the results of these previous studies remain controversial. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to assess their association.
RPE may be useful for exercise testing and prescription in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), although the roles of differentiated central and peripheral fatigue during exercise are not clear. We aimed to model differentiated RPE responses during graded arm cycling in individuals with SCI and to describe their relationship to cardiorespiratory outcomes.
PTEN inducible kinase-1 (PINK1) mutant induces mitochondrial dysfunction of cells, resulting in an inherited form of Parkinson's disease. However its exact role in the cardiomyocytes is unclear. The present study examined the function of PINK1 in hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) induced H9c2 cell damage and its potential mechanism. The H/R model in H9c2 cells was established by 6 h of hypoxia and 12 h of reoxygenation. The CCK8 and LDH assay indicated that the cell viability was obviously reduced after H/R. The expression of PINK1 was decreased in H/R-induced H9c2 cells compared with control group. The vector overexpressing PINK1 was constructed to transfect into H/R-induced H9c2 cells. Our results showed that cell viability was increased, cell apoptosis and caspase 3, cytochrome C (Cyto C) levels were decreased after LV-PINK1 transfection. Furthermore, PINK1 overexpression stabilized electron transport chain (ETC) activity, increased ATP production, mPTP opening and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), inhibited ROS-generating mitochondria, implying PINK1 alleviates H/R induced mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyocytes. In addition, the TRAP-1 siRNA was transfected into PINK1 treated H9c2 cells after H/R to detected the molecular mechanism of PINK1 protecting cardiomyocytes. The results indicated that silence of TRAP-1 reversed the effects of PINK1 in H/R-induced H9c2 cells. In conclusion, these results suggest that PINK1 overexpression alleviates H/R-induced cell damage of H9c2 cells by phosphorylation of TRAP-1, and that is a valid approach for protection from myocardial I/R injury.

CD36 gene encodes a membrane glycoprotein (type B scavenger receptor) present on the surface of many types of cells and having multiple cellular functions ranging from angiogenesis to gustatory perception of fatty acids. Using a case control genetic association approach we have analyzed selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) in a total of 859 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and controls and have identified the allele A in rs3211892 polymorphism of CD36 gene as significantly increasing the risk of AD. Additionally we have investigated, in the same sample of control subjects and patients, SNP's in ApoE gene and confirmed that the previously identified AD-associated SNP's indeed increased the risk and decreased the age of onset of AD as reported by others earlier. Based on the current knowledge of CD36 biochemistry we propose that the AD risk-imparting variants of CD36 alter cholesterol homeostasis, oxidation stress or induce pathological inflammatory cascades. The SNP rs3211892 has previously been associated with heart disease and other conditions but the present study is the first to identify a significant association between variations in CD36 gene and the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
EXTL3 regulates the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), important for both skeletal development and hematopoiesis, through the formation of HS proteoglycans (HSPGs). By whole-exome sequencing, we identified homozygous missense mutations c.1382C>T, c.1537C>T, c.1970A>G, and c.2008T>G in EXTL3 in nine affected individuals from five unrelated families. Notably, we found the identical homozygous missense mutation c.1382C>T (p.Pro461Leu) in four affected individuals from two unrelated families. Affected individuals presented with variable skeletal abnormalities and neurodevelopmental defects. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with a complete absence of T cells was observed in three families. EXTL3 was most abundant in hematopoietic stem cells and early progenitor T cells, which is in line with a SCID phenotype at the level of early T cell development in the thymus. To provide further support for the hypothesis that mutations in EXTL3 cause a neuro-immuno-skeletal dysplasia syndrome, and to gain insight into the pathogenesis of the disorder, we analyzed the localization of EXTL3 in fibroblasts derived from affected individuals and determined glycosaminoglycan concentrations in these cells as well as in urine and blood. We observed abnormal glycosaminoglycan concentrations and increased concentrations of the non-sulfated chondroitin disaccharide D0a0 and the disaccharide D0a4 in serum and urine of all analyzed affected individuals. In summary, we show that biallelic mutations in EXTL3 disturb glycosaminoglycan synthesis and thus lead to a recognizable syndrome characterized by variable expression of skeletal, neurological, and immunological abnormalities.
ABO blood groups are associated with some important chronic diseases. Previous studies have observed an association between ABO blood group and risk for obesity.
ATP6V1H is a component of a large protein complex with vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) activity. We identified two generations of individuals in which short stature and osteoporosis co-segregated with a mutation in ATP6V1H. Since V-ATPases are highly conserved between human and zebrafish, we generated loss-of-function mutants in atp6v1h in zebrafish through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout. Homozygous mutant atp6v1h zebrafish exhibited a severe reduction in the number of mature calcified bone cells and a dramatic increase in the expression of mmp9 and mmp13. Heterozygous adults showed curved vertebra that lack calcified centrum structure and reduced bone mass and density. Treatment of mutant embryos with small molecule inhibitors of MMP9 and MMP13 significantly restored bone mass in the atp6v1h mutants. These studies have uncovered a new, ATP6V1H-mediated pathway that regulates bone formation, and defines a new mechanism of disease that leads to bone loss. We propose that MMP9/MMP13 could be therapeutic targets for patients with this rare genetic disease.
IDO1 is an enzyme catalyzing the initial and rate-limiting step in the catabolism of tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway. IDO1 expression could suppress immune responses by blocking T-lymphocyte proliferation locally, suggesting a role of IDO in the regulation of immune responses. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of radiofluorinated carboximidamides as selective PET radioligands for IDO1. Specific binding correlated with IDO1 expression as measured through in vitro, microPET experiments. Specific accumulation of the new radiotracer [18F]IDO49 was observed in IDO1-expressing tumors and confirmed by Western blot and IHC analyses. These results suggest that [18F]IDO49 has substantial potential as an imaging agent that targets IDO1 in tumors, and therefore may be utilized as a companion diagnostic for IDO1 targeted therapies.
SUV39H1 is an H3K9 methyltransferase involved in the formation of heterochromatin. We investigated its substrate specificity profile and show recognition of H3 residues between K4 and G12 with highly specific readout of R8. The specificity profile of SUV39H1 is distinct from its paralog SUV39H2, indicating that they can have different additional substrates. Using the specificity profile, several novel SUV39H1 candidate substrates were identified. We observed methylation of 19 novel substrates at the peptide level and for six of them at the protein level. Methylation of RAG2, SET8, and DOT1L was confirmed in cells, which all have important roles in chromatin regulation. Methylation of SET8 allosterically stimulates its H4K20 monomethylation activity connecting SUV39H1 to the generation of increased H4K20me3 levels, another heterochromatic modification. Methylation of RAG2 alters its subnuclear localization, indicating that SUV39H1 might regulate VDJ recombination. Taken together, our results indicate that beyond the generation of H3K9me3, SUV39H1 has additional roles in chromatin biology by direct stimulation of the establishment of H4K20me3 and the regulation of chromatin binding of RAG2.
CYP2D6 belongs to P450 superfamily, and is responsible for the metabolism of 25% of the drugs used clinically. Genetic variability of CYP2D6 affects individual drug or toxic response leading to differences in the drug outcome or toxicity mediating adverse drug effects. The different variant alleles are associated with increased, decreased, or abolished enzyme hydroxylation functions. The CYP2D6*10 (rs1065852, c.100C>T) allele is associated with reduced function and is one of the most studied alleles.
PRPS1 (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1), which drives the nucleotide biosynthesis pathway, modulates a variety of functions by providing central building blocks and cofactors for cell homeostasis. As tumor cells often display abnormal nucleotide metabolism, dysregulated de-novo nucleotide synthesis has potential impacts in cancers. We now report that PRPS1 is specifically and highly expressed in chemoresistant (CR) cancer cells derived from cisplatin-resistant human breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3 and MCF-7. The inhibition of PRPS1 activity in CR cells by genetic silencing reduces cell viability and increases apoptosis in vitro, both of which can be further potentiated by cisplatin treatment. Significantly, such down-regulation of PRPS1 in CR cells when administered to nude mice enhanced the survival of those animals, as demonstrated by decreased tumor growth. Knockdown of PRPSI may cause these effects by potently inducing autonomous activation of caspase-3 and inhibiting the proliferation in the engrafted CR tumors. As a result, cisplatin sensitivity in a xenograft model of CR cancer cells can be restored by the down-regulation of PRPS1. Thus, PRPS1 inhibition may afford a therapeutic approach to relapsed patients with breast cancer, resistant to chemotherapy.
CYP1A1 is a gene involved in the high aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase -inducible phenotype, which is a genetically-determined variation among individuals that has been associated with lung cancer risk. More specifically, CYP1A1*2B and *4 polymorphisms have been associated with high susceptibility to lung cancer among cigarette smokers.
AKR1C1 is a member of the AKR1C family, which not only plays an important role in hormone metabolism but is believed to be involved in carcinogen metabolism. Our previous study demonstrated that AKR1C1 was highly expressed in lung tumor tissues as compared with the tumor-adjacent tissues. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a special type of lung cancer. Surgical treatment of SCLC is usually difficult due to the high degree of malignancy and early metastasis, and difficulty in obtaining clinical specimens. There is not much basic or clinical research on SCLC in the People's Republic of China even in recent years. To investigate the mechanism of AKR1C1 in the pathogenesis of SCLC, the present study used H446 cell line to see whether AKR1C1 could affect the proliferation or migration of SCLC cells, and used a lentivirus to build the AKR1C1 overexpression and under-expression cell lines. The results indicated that AKR1C1 was an important inducement in the proliferation and migration of H446 cells. AKR1C1 promoted cell proliferation and played a vital role in the migration of SCLC cells. These results were also verified in nude mice in vivo. In conclusion, AKR1C1 plays an important role in the development and progression of SCLC and may represent an independent biomarker for assessment of the primary prognosis and therapy of SCLC.
ABO blood groups were determined in 110 cases of vitiligo and an equal number of controls among Indian Armed Forces personnel and their dependents. Statistically there was no significant difference.
ABO and Rh blood groups among 54 syphilitics were determined. A significantly increased incidence of syphilis in persons blood groups B and AB was observed; significant decrease in those having groups A and 0. A significant decrease in, the incidence of syphilis was also observed in Rh negative 'subjects. These results suggest a possible relationship between the inheritance of blood groups and the natural defence mechanism against syphilis.
ABO blood group, except its direct clinical implications for transfusion and organ transplantation, is generally accepted as an effect factor for coronary heart disease, but the associations between ABO blood group and congenital heart disease (CHD) are not coherent by previous reports. In this study, we evaluated the the potential relationship between ABO blood group and CHD risk. In 39,042 consecutive inpatients (19,795 CHD VS 19,247 controls), we used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the roles of ABO blood group, gender, and RH for CHD. The associations between ABO blood group and CHD subgroups, were further evaluated using stratification analysis, adjusted by gender. A blood group demonstrated decreased risk for isolated CHD (OR 0.82; 95% CI, 0.78-0.87) in individuals with A blood group in the overall cohort analysis, and the finding was consistently replicated in independent subgroup analysis. ABO blood group may have a role for CHD, and this novel finding provides ABO blood group as a possible marker for CHD, but more studies need to be done.
NDST1 encodes an enzyme involved in the first steps in the synthesis of heparan sulfate chains, proteoglycans that are regulators found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. Eight individuals homozygous for one of four family-specific missense mutations in the sulfotransferase domain of the enzyme have been described. They have intellectual disability. Some additionally had hypotonia, ataxia. seizures, and/or short stature, but none had history of respiratory problems. No humans with homozygous null mutations are known. ndst1b (orthologous to NDST1) morpholino knockdown in zebrafish (Danio rerio) causes delayed development, craniofacial cartilage abnormalities, shortened body and pectoral fin length. Ndst1 homozygous null mice have craniofacial abnormalities and die within the first 10 h of life of respiratory failure. We report a girl upon whom deep phenotyping, extensive genetic and biochemical investigations, and exome sequencing were performed. She had cranial nerves dysfunction, gastroesophageal reflux, history of a seizure, ataxia, developmental delays, head sparing failure to thrive, and minor malformations including distinctive facial features and a bifid uvula. Compound heterozygous mutations in NDST1 were identified, in the heparan sulfate N deacetylatase domain of one allele and the sulfotransferase domain of the other allele. This report expands the phenotypic spectrum of Ndst1 deficiency in humans. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
PTEN is an important tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Here, we examined the prognostic and predictive value of PTEN and PTEN pseudogene (PTENP1) gene expression in patients with locally advanced breast cancer given neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
AKR1B10 is a human-type aldo-keto reductase. The up-regulation of AKR1B10 has been associated with various cancers including non-small cell lung carcinoma, viral and bacterial infections, and skin diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying AKR1B10 gene regulation are not fully understood. We previously indicated the involvement of the transcription factor Nrf2 in AKR1B10 gene regulation. There are at least five potential Nrf2-responsive consensus sequences, so-called antioxidant response elements (AREs), and several ARE-like sequences in the 5'-flanking region up to -3282 bp of the AKR1B10 gene. In the present study, we attempted to identify functional AREs by luciferase reporter analyses using various mutants for each ARE. And we found that only those between -530 and -520 bp (ARE-A), which is the closest location to the translation start site, were functional among the five ARE consensus sites examined. Furthermore, ARE-A functioned co-operatively with the neighboring AP-1 site. Since the AP-1 site resembles ARE, the tandem arrangement of these two elements may be essential for augmented responsiveness to Nrf2 and plays an important role in AKR1B10 gene regulation by various Nrf2-mediating stimuli.
CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 are polymorphic drug-metabolising enzymes that are also implicated in the activation of procarcinogens in humans. Some of their alleles and haplotypes, often varied in prevalence across populations, are thought to influence activity despite the known contribution of environmental factors. This study assessed the potential influence of some genetic variants of CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 on metabolic phenotypes in Nigerians.
GNE myopathy is rare muscle disease which affect distal muscles. GNE gene, which encodes for a key enzyme in the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway, is mutated in the homozygote or compound heterozygote in the disease. The lack of sialic acid in skeletal muscle is the critical pathological process in GNE myopathy. GNE myopathy model mouse was established and supplementation of sialic acid improves the phenotype of model mouse. Phase Ⅰ clinical trial was conducted at Tohoku University Hospital using aceneuramic acid, followed by the trials using slow release product of sialic acid. Phase Ⅱ/Ⅲ study is ongoing.
AMACR (alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase) has been recently described as a prostate cancer-specific gene that encodes a protein involved in the beta-oxidation of branched chain fatty acids. Expression of AMACR protein is found in prostatic adenocarcinoma, but not in benign prostatic tissue. Thus, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for AMACR detection are an important tool for the diagnosis of AMACR-positive cancers. However, only a few mAbs, especially those applicable for immunohistochemistry (IHC), have been established to date. In this study, we describe the generation of a new hybridoma clone G8 producing anti-AMACR antibodies. G8 mAb specifically binds human AMACR and was successfully used in immunoblotting and immunofluorescence on paraformaldehyde-fixed cells and in IHC of paraffin-embedded tumor specimens. These results indicate that this new anti-AMACR mAb G8 would be useful in the diagnosis of AMACR-related cancers and would be a strong tool in both basic and clinical research on AMACR.
DGAT2 is the critical catalyzing enzyme for triglyceride biosynthesis, and excess triglyceride accumulation in fat tissues is a fundamental process for obesity. Mutations in DGAT2 or other genes interacting with DGAT2 associated with adiposity have not been reported in human to date.
COX5A is a nuclear-encoded subunit of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase). We present patients with a homozygous pathogenic variant in the COX5A gene. Clinical details of two affected siblings suffering from early-onset pulmonary arterial hypertension, lactic acidemia, failure to thrive, and isolated complex IV deficiency are presented. We show that the variant lies within the evolutionarily conserved COX5A/COX4 interface domain, suggesting that it alters the interaction between these two subunits during complex IV biogenesis. In patient skin fibroblasts, the enzymatic activity and protein levels of complex IV and several of its subunits are reduced. Lentiviral complementation rescues complex IV deficiency. The monomeric COX1 assembly intermediate accumulates demonstrating a function of COX5A in complex IV biogenesis. A potential therapeutic lead is demonstrated by showing that copper supplementation leads to partial rescue of complex IV deficiency in patient fibroblasts.
SLC22A2 facilitates the transport of endogenous and exogenous cationic compounds. Many pharmacologically significant compounds are transported by SLC22A2, including the antidiabetic drug metformin, anticancer agent cisplatin, and antiretroviral lamivudine. Genetic polymorphisms in SLC22A2 can modify the pharmacokinetic profiles of such important medicines and could therefore prove useful as precision medicine biomarkers. Since the frequency of SLC22A2 polymorphisms varies among different ethnic populations, we evaluated these in South African Bantu speakers, a majority group in the South African population, who exhibit unique genetic diversity, and we subsequently functionally characterized promoter polymorphisms. We identified 11 polymorphisms within the promoter and 9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the coding region of SLC22A2. While some polymorphisms appeared with minor allele frequencies similar to other African and non-African populations, some differed considerably; this was especially notable for three missense polymorphisms. In addition, we functionally characterized two promoter polymorphisms; rs138765638, a three base-pair deletion that bioinformatics analysis suggested could alter c-Ets-1/2, Elk1, and/or STAT4 binding, and rs59695691, an SNP that could abolish TFII-I binding. Significantly higher luciferase reporter gene expression was found for rs138765638 (increase of 37%; p = 0.001) and significantly lower expression for rs59695691 (decrease of 25%; p = 0.038), in comparison to the wild-type control. These observations highlight the importance of identifying and functionally characterizing genetic variation in genes of pharmacological significance. Finally, our data for SLC22A2 attest to the importance of considering genetic variation in different populations for drug safety, response, and global pharmacogenomics, through, for example, projects such as the Human Heredity and Health in Africa initiative.
ABCD1 and its homolog ABCD2 are peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette (ABC) half-transporters of fatty acyl-CoAs with both distinct and overlapping substrate specificities. Although it is established that ABC half-transporters have at least to dimerize to generate a functional unit, functional equivalents of tetramers (
CYP1B1 is implicated to have a role in the development of breast, ovarian, renal, skin and lung carcinomas. It has been suggested that identification of potent and specific CYP1B1 inhibitors can lead to a novel treatment of cancer. Flavonoids have a compact rigid skeleton which fit precisely within the binding cavity of CYP1B1. Systematic isosteric replacement of flavonoid 'O' atom with 'N' atom led to the prediction that a 'quinazoline' scaffold could be the basis for designing potential CYP1B1 inhibitors. A total of 20 quinazoline analogs were synthesized and screened for CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 inhibition in Sacchrosomes™. IC
ABO blood types are putatively associated with the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), but it is not proved in Chinese people. A large population of Han Chinese patients discharged from Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2010 and June 2016 were retrospectively analyzed in a case-control study. A total of 1412 VTE patients were identified from 200,660 discharged Han Chinese patients, including 600 patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 441 patients with pulmonary embolism, and 371 patients with both DVT and pulmonary embolism. The prevalence of non-O blood type was weakly but statistically higher in VTE patients compared with 199,248 non-VTE patients, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.362 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.205-1.540). Subgroup analysis showed that the OR for non-O blood type was still increased. It was greater in pre-hospital VTE (OR = 1.464) than that in hospital-acquired VTE (OR = 1.224), and greater in unprovoked VTE (OR = 1.859) than that in provoked VTE (OR = 1.227). The OR for non-O blood type decreased with age in subgroup analysis. These results suggest a weak but statistically significant correlation between non-O blood type and risk of VTE in Han Chinese people.
PTEN is a PIP3 phosphatase that antagonizes oncogenic PI3-kinase signalling. Due to its critical role in suppressing the potent signalling pathway, it is one of the most mutated tumour suppressors, especially in brain tumours. It is generally thought that PTEN deficiencies predominantly result from either loss of expression or enzymatic activity. By analysing PTEN in malignant glioblastoma primary cells derived from 16 of our patients, we report mutations that block localization of PTEN at the plasma membrane and nucleus without affecting lipid phosphatase activity. Cellular and biochemical analyses as well as structural modelling revealed that two mutations disrupt intramolecular interaction of PTEN and open its conformation, enhancing polyubiquitination of PTEN and decreasing protein stability. Moreover, promoting mono-ubiquitination increases protein stability and nuclear localization of mutant PTEN. Thus, our findings provide a molecular mechanism for cancer-associated PTEN defects and may lead to a brain cancer treatment that targets PTEN mono-ubiquitination.
SLC13A5 is a Na⁺-coupled transporter for citrate that is expressed in the plasma membrane of specific cell types in the liver, testis, and brain. It is an electrogenic transporter with a Na⁺:citrate
GNE myopathy (GNEM), also known as hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), is a late- onset, progressive myopathy caused by mutations in the GNE gene encoding the enzyme responsible for the first regulated step in the biosynthesis of sialic acid (SA). The disease is characterized by distal muscle weakness in both the lower and upper extremities, with the quadriceps muscle relatively spared until the late stages of disease. To explore the role of SA synthesis in the disease, we conducted a comprehensive and systematic analysis of both free and total SA levels in a large cohort of GNEM patients and a mouse model. A sensitive LC/MS/MS assay was developed to quantify SA in serum and muscle homogenates. Mean serum free SA level was 0.166 μg/mL in patients and 18% lower (p<0.001) than that of age-matched control samples (0.203 μg/mL). In biopsies obtained from patients, mean free SA levels of different muscles ranged from 0.046-0.075 μg/μmol Cr and were markedly lower by 72-85% (p<0.001) than free SA from normal controls. Free SA was shown to constitute a small fraction (3-7%) of the total SA pool in muscle tissue. Differences in mean total SA levels in muscle from patients compared with normal controls were less distinct and more variable between different muscles, suggesting a small subset of sialylation targets could be responsible for the pathogenesis of GNEM. Normal quadriceps had significantly lower levels of free SA (reduced by 39%) and total SA (reduced by 53%) compared to normal gastrocnemius. A lower SA requirement for quadriceps may be linked to the reported quadriceps sparing in GNEM. Analysis of SA levels in GneM743T/M743T mutant mice corroborated the human study results. These results show that serum and muscle free SA is severely reduced in GNEM, which is consistent with the biochemical defect in SA synthesis associated with GNE mutations. These results therefore support the approach of reversing SA depletion as a potential treatment for GNEM patients.
PIK3CA gene encodes the p110 α catalytic subunit of the oncoprotein phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 K) which regulates many biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival through the activation of various signaling pathways.
CYP1A1 functions in detoxifying xenobiotics but occasionally converts compounds into potent genotoxins. CYP1A1 activates polyaromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzo[a]pyrene 7,8 dihydrodiol (BaP-DHD), rendering them genotoxic. Particular alleles of CYP1A1, such as CYP1A1 I462V have been correlated with a higher incidence of breast and lung cancer, but it is unknown whether these variants express enzymes in vivo that are more potent in generating genotoxins. We individually expressed CYP1A1 (CYP1A1.1), CYP1A1 T461N (CYP1A1.4) and I462V (CYP1A1.2) alleles in wild-type and DNA repair deficient mutant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) and asked which yeast strains exhibited the highest levels of carcinogen-associated genotoxicity after exposure to BaP-DHD, aflatoxin B1 (AFB
GNE myopathy is a rare autosomal recessive inheritance disease due to the mutation of GNE gene. To date, 107 mutations have been reported in different populations worldwide in GNE gene(HGMD Professional 2016.2). Here we report a patient of novel homozygous GNE gene mutation from China.
ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely prescribed in patients with high cardiovascular (CV) risk. However, whether both classes have equivalent effectiveness to prevent CV events remains unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of major CV events between ACEI and ARB users.
PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) refers to a group of clinical conditions caused by germline mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. Increasing evidence has documented that PHTS may be associated with a broader spectrum of structural brain abnormalities, including dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum, brain tumors, vascular malformations, white matter abnormalities, dilated perivascular spaces and cortical dysplasia. We report a PTEN-mutated child showing macrocephaly, mild intellectual disability and epilepsy symptomatic of right occipital polymicrogyria, who also developed Chiari I Malformation (CIM) that repeatedly required surgical correction. We suppose that the association between PHTS and CIM could be not coincidental, thus extending the spectrum of neurological manifestations of PHTS and highlighting the role of brain MRI in the management of PHTS patients. We suggest that genes within the RAS-MAPK and PI3-AKT pathways might have a significant role in the pathogenesis of CIM in such patients.
CD36 is a multifunctional membrane-type receptor glycoprotein that reacts with oxidized low-density lipoprotein and long-chain fatty acid (LCFA). However, much remains to be understood about the molecular mechanism of the cardio-myopathy observed in CD36-KO mice. In this study, we identify different genes pathways involved in response to CD36 cardio-myopathy phenotype by identifying the differences among biological processes, molecular pathways and networks of interactions that emerge from knocking CD3 and using different bioinformatics tools such as STRING, GeneMANIA and Cytoscape. We were able list all the CD36-regulated genes, their related function and their specific networks. Data analysis showed that CD36-regulated genes differentially expressed are involved in biological processes such as FA metabolism, angiogenesis/apoptosis and cell structure. These results provide the first look at mechanisms involved in CD36 deficiency and development of cardio-myopathy and the opportunity to identify new therapeutic targets.
ACER2 is a critical sphingolipid metabolizing enzyme, and has been shown to be remarkably up-regulated following various stimuli such as DNA damage. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of ACER2 gene and its potential role in the regulation of autophagy remain unknown. In this study, we have for the first time identified the human ACER2 gene promoter, and found that human ACER2 transcription is directly regulated by p53 and ACER2 is implicated in the induction of autophagy as well as apoptosis. A series of luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that ACER2 major promoter is located within its first intron where the consensus p53-binding sites exist. Consistently, forced expression of p53 significantly stimulated ACER2 transcription. Notably, p53-mediated autophagy and apoptosis were markedly enhanced by ACER2. Depletion of the essential autophagy gene ATG5 revealed that ACER2-induced autophagy facilitates its effect on apoptosis. Further studies clearly showed that ACER2-mediated autophagy and apoptosis are accompanied by ROS generation. In summary, our present study strongly suggests that ACER2 plays a pivotal role in p53-induced autophagy and apoptosis, and thus might serve as a novel and attractive molecular target for cancer treatment.
ABO genotyping has common tools for personal identification of forensic and transplantation field. We developed a new method based on a droplet allele-specific PCR (droplet-AS-PCR) that enabled rapid PCR amplification. We attempted rapid ABO genotyping using crude DNA isolated from dried blood and buccal cells.
G6PD deficiency, an enzymopathy affecting 7% of the world population, is caused by over 160 identified amino acid variants in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). The clinical presentation of G6PD deficiency is diverse, likely due to the broad distribution of variants across the protein and the potential for multidimensional biochemical effects. In this study, we use bioinformatic and biochemical analyses to interpret the relationship between G6PD variants and their clinical phenotype. Using structural information and statistical analyses of known G6PD variants, we predict the molecular phenotype of five uncharacterized variants from a reference population database. Through multidimensional analysis of biochemical data, we demonstrate that the clinical phenotypes of G6PD variants are largely determined by a trade-off between protein stability and catalytic activity. This work expands the current understanding of the biochemical underpinnings of G6PD variant pathogenicity and suggests a promising avenue for correcting G6PD deficiency by targeting essential structural features of G6PD.
ABCG2 is a membrane transport protein that effluxes growth-promoting molecules, such as folates and dihydrotestosterone, as well as chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore it is important to determine how variants of ABCG2 affect the transporter function in order to determine whether modified treatment regimens may be necessary for patients harboring ABCG2 variants. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between the ABCG2 Q141K variant and overall survival after a prostate cancer diagnosis. We report here that in patients with recurrent prostate cancer, those who carry the ABCG2 Q141K variant had a significantly shorter time to PSA recurrence post-prostatectomy than patients homozygous for wild-type ABCG2 (P=0.01). Transport studies showed that wild-type ABCG2 was able to efflux more folic acid than the Q141K variant (P<0.002), suggesting that retained tumoral folate contributes to the decreased time to PSA recurrence in the Q141K variant patients. In a seemingly conflicting study, it was previously reported that docetaxel-treated Q141K variant prostate cancer patients have a longer survival time. We found this may be due to less efficient docetaxel efflux in cells with the Q141K variant versus wild-type ABCG2. In human prostate cancer tissues, confocal microscopy revealed that all genotypes had a mixture of cytoplasmic and plasma membrane staining, with noticeably less staining in the two homozygous KK patients. In conclusion, the Q141K variant plays contrasting roles in prostate cancer: 1) by decreasing folate efflux, increased intracellular folate levels result in enhanced tumor cell proliferation and therefore time to recurrence decreases; and 2) in patients treated with docetaxel, by decreasing its efflux, intratumoral docetaxel levels and tumor cell drug sensitivity increase and therefore patient survival time increases. Taken together, these data suggest that a patient's ABCG2 genotype may be important when determining a personalized treatment plan.
CYP24A1 mutations are now accepted as a cause of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH). A rapid liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based blood test enabling measurement of the 25-OH-D
GAPDH was speculated to function as a transient trap to reduce the potential toxicity of free heme by a specific and reversible binding with heme. Up to now, there has been lack of studies focused on this effect. In this paper, the efficiency of GAPDH-heme complex on catalyzing protein carbonylation and nitration, the cross-linking of heme to protein formation, and cytotoxicity of GAPDH-heme were studied. It was found that the binding of GAPDH could inhibit H
HMGCS2 (mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-COA synthase 2) is a control enzyme in ketogenesis. The mitochondrial localization and interaction with APP (β-amyloid precursor protein) suggest that HMGCS2 may play a role in the pathophysiology of AD (Alzheimer's disease). Here we report that overexpression of HMGCS2 decreased levels of APP and related CTFs (carboxy-terminal fragments), which was largely prevented by an autophagic inhibitor chloroquine. In addition, HMGCS2 enhancement of autophagic marker LC3II was diminished by rapamycin, an inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin. Moreover, deprivation of EBSS (Earle's Balanced Salt Solution) significantly augmented the effect of HMGCS2 on LC3II, while acetoacetate reversed the reduction of LC3II, APP and CTFs which was induced by HMGCS2 knockdown. In the presence of acetoacetate, rapamycin failed to induce further increase of LC3II, which mimicked the effect of HMGCS2 overexpression. Finally, HMGCS2 enhanced the antioxidant response. Collectively, HMGCS2 shares with ketone bodies common features in autophagic clearance of APP and CTFs, suggesting that ketone bodies play an important role in HMGCS2 regulation of the autophagy.
ABO incompatible kidney transplantation (ABOi-KT) is an important approach for overcoming donor shortages. We evaluated the effect of ABOi-KT on living donor KT.
PTEN is a critical tumour suppressor that is frequently mutated in human cancer. We have previously identified a CUG initiated PTEN isoform designated PTENα, which functions in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Here we report the identification of another N-terminal extended PTEN isoform, designated PTENβ. PTENβ translation is initiated from an AUU codon upstream of and in-frame with the AUG initiation sequence for canonical PTEN. We show that the Kozak context and a downstream hairpin structure are critical for this alternative initiation. PTENβ localizes predominantly in the nucleolus, and physically associates with and dephosphorylates nucleolin, which is a multifunctional nucleolar phosphoprotein. Disruption of PTENβ alters rDNA transcription and promotes ribosomal biogenesis, and this effect can be reversed by re-introduction of PTENβ. Our data show that PTENβ regulates pre-rRNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. These results demonstrate the complexity of the PTEN protein family and the diversity of its functions.
PTEN is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers. The frequency of PTEN alterations is particularly high in endometrial carcinomas. Loss of PTEN leads to dysregulation of cell division, and promotes the accumulation of cell cycle complexes such as cyclin D1-CDK4/6, which is an important feature of the tumour phenotype. Cell cycle proteins have been presented as key targets in the treatment of the pathogenesis of cancer, and several CDK inhibitors have been developed as a strategy to generate new anticancer drugs. Palbociclib (PD-332991) specifically inhibits CDK4/6, and it has been approved for use in metastatic breast cancer in combination with letrazole. Here, we used a tamoxifen-inducible Pten knockout mouse model to assess the antitumour effects of cyclin D1 knockout and CDK4/6 inhibition by palbociclib on endometrial tumours. Interestingly, both cyclin D1 deficiency and palbociclib treatment triggered shrinkage of endometrial neoplasias. In addition, palbociclib treatment significantly increased the survival of Pten-deficient mice, and, as expected, had a general effect in reducing tumour cell proliferation. To further analyse the effects of palbociclib on endometrial carcinoma, we established subcutaneous tumours with human endometrial cancer cell lines and primary endometrial cancer xenografts, which allowed us to provide more translational and predictive data. To date, this is the first preclinical study evaluating the response to CDK4/6 inhibition in endometrial malignancies driven by PTEN deficiency, and it reveals an important role of cyclin D-CDK4/6 activity in their development.

IDH1 gene mutation has been demonstrated to be an oncogenic driver in a majority of lower-grade gliomas (LGGs). In contrast to other central nervous neoplasms and normal brain tissue without IDH1 mutation, almost 80% of LGGs exhibit IDH1 mutation. Therefore, expeditious detection of IDH1 mutation is useful, not only for intraoperative diagnosis of these gliomas but also for determination of the border between the tumor and normal brain tissue. In this study, we established a rapid genotyping assay with a simple DNA extraction method, involving only incubation of the tumor specimen with Tris-EDTA buffer, which can be easily performed in an operating room. In all 11 tested cases, we could identify the IDH1 status within 90-100 min intraoperatively. In a case of anaplastic astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, we could detect the tumor border by IDH1 profiling. In addition, with this assay, we could detect IDH1 mutation using cell-free tumor DNA derived from cerebrospinal fluid in a case of glioblastoma, IDH-mutant. Considering that clinical trials of mutated IDH1 inhibitors are ongoing, less-invasive intraoperative IDH1 gene profiling might be useful for decision making of the overall treatment strategy of LGGs. Our assay might be a useful tool for precision medicine and surgery of IDH1-mutant gliomas.
CYP3A4 is the main human metabolizing enzyme, and many clinically relevant drug/herb-drug interactions (DDIs/HDIs) involving CYP3A4 are due to mechanism-based inhibition. In this study, pharmacophore model together with molecular docking (MD) are used to rapidly screen the potential CYP3A4 mechanism-based inhibitors from Tripterygium wilfordii, and in vitro experiments are conducted to validate the computational data. The results showed that the rate of computational prediction could be improved based on a combination of pharmacophore model and MD, and a combination of computational approaches might be a useful tool to identify potential mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4 from herbal medicines.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) is one of the most important tumor-suppressor proteins, which plays a key role in negative regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, and governs many cellular processes including growth, proliferation, survival and migration. The dynamics of PTEN proteins in single living cells is as yet unclear owing to a shortage of suitable in vivo approaches. Here, we report a single-molecule method for in vivo study of the dynamics of PTEN proteins in living cells using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). First, we established a monoclonal H1299 stable cell line expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and PTEN (EGFP-PTEN) fusion proteins; we then developed an in vivo FCS method to study the dynamics of EGFP-PTEN both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We investigated the diffusion behaviors of EGFP and EGFP-PTEN in solution, nucleus and cytosol, and observed that the motion of PTEN in living cells was restricted compared with EGFP. Finally, we investigated the protein dynamics in living cells under oxidative stress stimulation and a cellular ATP depletion treatment. Under oxidative stress stimulation, the EGFP-PTEN concentration increased in the nucleus, but slightly decreased in the cytoplasm. The diffusion coefficient and alpha value of EGFP-PTEN reduced significantly both in the nucleus and cytoplasm; the significantly decreased alpha parameter indicates a more restricted Brownian diffusion behavior. Under the cellular ATP depletion treatment, the concentration of EGFP-PTEN remained unchanged in the nucleus and decreased significantly in cytosol. The diffusion coefficient of EGFP-PTEN decreased significantly in cytosol, but showed no significant change in the nucleus; the alpha value decreased significantly in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. These results suggest that the concentration and mobility of PTEN in the nucleus and cytoplasm can be regulated by stimulation methods. Our approach provides a unique method for real-time monitoring of protein dynamics in different subcellular compartments under different stimulation treatments.
SCD stems from amutation in the beta globin gene. Upon deoxygenation, hemoglobin polymerizes and triggers RBC remodeling. This phenomenon is central to SCD pathogenesis as individuals suffering from the disease are plagued by painful vaso-occlusive crises episodes. These episodes are the result of a combination of processes including inflammation, thrombosis, and blood cell adhesion to the vascular wall which leads to blockages within the vasculature termed vaso-occlusions. Vaso-occlusive episodes deprive tissues of oxygen and are a major contributor to SCD-related complications; unfortunately, the complex mechanisms that contribute to vaso-occlusions are not well understood. Vaso-occlusions can occur in post-capillary venules; hence, the microvasculature is a prime target for SCD therapies. Traditional in vitro systems poorly recapitulate architectural and dynamic flow properties of in vivo systems. However, microfluidic devices can capture features of the native vasculature such as cellular composition, flow, geometry, and ECM presentation. This review, although not comprehensive, highlights microfluidic approaches that aim to improve our current understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms surrounding SCD. Microfluidic platforms can aid in identifying factors that may contribute to disease severity and can serve as suitable test beds for novel treatment strategies which may improve patient outcomes.
CYP1B1 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms G119T, C432G, and A453G were tested among 164 NSCLC patients treated by Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery. After a follow-up period of 5 years, it was found that CYP1B1 G119T mutant genotypes were related to a higher risk of tumor recurrence and death after surgical resection. However, C432G and A453G genotypes had no influence on long-term prognosis of the study cohort. Thus, G199T alleles are supposed to be an auxiliary predictor for prognosis of NSCLC patients and a potential target for precise drug intervention, as well as a candidate for further anticancer drug research.
ESD is the treatment of choice for superficial neoplasms of the oesophagus; ESD is oncologically efficient and associated with less morbidity than the surgical alternative. ESD requires a high level of skill, being both technically challenging and time consuming. Therefore, ESD is often reserved for experts. A combination of a tunnel technique with clip-line traction may enable optimisation of oesophageal ESD.
ABO blood group is a hereditary factor of plasma levels of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and von Willebrand factor (VWF). Age and gender have been shown to influence FVIII, VWF, fibrinogen (Fbg), and ADAMTS13 (A disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 13). We investigated the effects of ABO type, age, and gender on plasma levels of FVIII, Fbg, VWF, and ADAMTS13 in a Chinese population.
CYP2D6 is a key pharmacogene encoding an enzyme impacting poor, intermediate, extensive and ultrarapid phase I metabolism of many marketed drugs. The pharmacogenetics of opiate drug metabolism is particularly interesting due to the relatively high incidence of addiction and overdose. Recently, trans-acting opiate metabolism and analgesic response enzymes (UGT2B7, ABCB1, OPRM1 and COMT) have been incorporated into pharmacogenetic studies to generate more comprehensive metabolic profiles of patients. With use of massively parallel sequencing, it is possible to identify additional polymorphisms that fine tune, or redefine, previous pharmacogenetic findings, which typically rely on targeted approaches. The 1000 Genomes Project data were analyzed to describe population genetic variation and statistics for these five genes in self-reported healthy individuals in five global super- and 26 sub-populations. Findings on the variation of these genes in various populations expand baseline understanding of pharmacogenetically relevant polymorphisms for future studies of affected cohorts.
ABCB1 expression is uncommon in ovarian cancers in the clinical setting so we investigated non-MDR mechanisms of resistance to taxanes.
IDS is responsible for the lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate and linked to an X-linked lysosomal storage disease, mucopolysaccharidosis 2 (MPS2), resulting in neurological damage and early death. Comparative IDS amino acid sequences and structures and IDS gene locations were examined using data from several vertebrate genome projects. Vertebrate IDS sequences shared 60-99% identities with each other. Human IDS showed 47% sequence identity with fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) IDS. Sequence alignments, key amino acid residues, N-glycosylation sites and conserved predicted secondary and tertiary structures were also studied, including signal peptide, propeptide and active site residues. Mammalian IDS genes usually contained 9 coding exons. The human IDS gene promoter contained a large CpG island (CpG46) and 5 transcription factor binding sites, whereas the 3'-UTR region contained 5 miRNA target sites. These may contribute to IDS gene regulation of expression in the brain and other neural tissues of the body. An IDS pseudogene (IDSP1) was located proximally to the IDS gene on the X-chromosome in primate genomes. Phylogenetic analyses examined the relationships and potential evolutionary origins of the vertebrate IDS gene. These suggested that IDS has originated in an invertebrate ancestral genome and retained throughout vertebrate evolution and conserved on marsupial and eutherian X-chromosomes, with the exception of rat Ids on chromosome 8.
SMS text messaging is increasingly used for delivering smoking cessation support and pilot studies suggest this may also be useful in pregnancy. This study explores the views of women who received a tailored text messaging cessation intervention (MiQuit) during pregnancy, focusing on acceptability, perceived impact, and suggestions for improvements.
STS and 17β-HSD1 are attractive targets for the treatment of estrogen-dependent diseases like endometriosis and breast cancer. The simultaneous inhibition of both enzymes appears more promising than blockage of either protein alone. We describe a designed multiple ligand approach resulting in highly potent dual inhibitors. The most interesting compound 9 showed nanomolar IC
IDO1 (indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1), a well characterized immunosuppressive enzyme, has attracted growing attention as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. Hydroxylamidine compounds INCB024360 and INCB14943 (INCB024360 analogue) are highly effective IDO1 inhibitors. INCB024360 is undergoing clinical trials for treatment of various types of human cancer. Here, we determined the co-crystal structure of IDO1 and INCB14943, and elucidate the detailed binding mode. INCB14943 binds to heme iron in IDO1 protein through the oxime nitrogen. Further analysis also reveals that a halogen bonding interaction between the chlorine atom (3-Cl) of INCB14943 and the sulphur atom of C129 significantly improves the inhibition activity against IDO1. Comparing with the other reported inhibitors, the oxime nitrogen and halogen bond interaction are identified as the unique features of INCB14943 among the IDO1 inhibitors. Thus, our study provides novel insights into the interaction between a small molecule inhibitor INCB14943 and IDO1 protein. The structural information will facilitate future IDO1 inhibitor design.
SETD7 is associated with multiple diseases related signaling pathways. (R)-PFI-2 is the first SETD7 inhibitor with nanomolar inhibitory potency. The activity of (R)-PFI-2 is about 500 times over that of (S)-PFI-2. Understanding the mechanism behind this difference will be helpful to discovery and design of more potent SETD7 inhibitors. A computational study combining molecular dynamics simulation, binding free energy calculations, and residue interaction network (RIN) was performed on the (S)-PFI-2/SETD7 and (R)-PFI-2/SETD7 complexes to explore the molecular mechanism behind the different inhibition activity. The results from Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) calculation show (R)-PFI-2 has lower binding free energy. Residues H252, D256, L267, Y335, G336 and H339 are responsible for the binding of SETD7 to the (R)-PFI-2. RIN analysis indicates van der Waals interaction is critical for the binding of (R)-PFI-2. The results from adaptive basing force (ABF) simulation confirm that the free energy barrier of (R)-PFI-2 dissociating from the SETD7 is larger than that of (S)-PFI-2. (S)-PFI-2 and (R)-PFI-2 dissociate from the SETD7 binding site along different reaction coordinate and have potential mean of force (PMF) depth. Our simulations results will be useful to understand molecular mechanism of activity difference between PFI-2 enantiomers against SETD7.
STT3A encodes the catalytic subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex. A congenital disorder of glycosylation caused by mutations in STT3A has only been reported in one family to date, associated with a Type I congenital disorder of glycosylation pattern of transferrin glycoforms. The authors describe a further 5 related individuals with a likely pathogenic variant in STT3A, 2 of whom also had variants in TUSC3. Common phenotypic features in all symptomatic individuals include developmental delay, intellectual disability, with absent speech and seizures. Two individuals also developed episodic hypothermia and altered consciousness. The family were investigated by autozygosity mapping, which revealed both a homozygous region containing STT3A and, in addition, a homozygous deletion of TUSC3 in one child. A likely pathogenic variant in STT3A was confirmed on Sanger sequencing of all affected individuals: the authors discuss the molecular findings in detail and further delineate the clinical phenotype of this rare disorder.
GNE (UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase) myopathy is a rare muscle disorder associated with aging and is related to sporadic inclusion body myositis, the most common acquired muscle disease of aging. Although the cause of sporadic inclusion body myositis is unknown, GNE myopathy is associated with mutations in GNE. GNE harbors two enzymatic activities required for biosynthesis of sialic acid in mammalian cells. Mutations to both GNE domains are linked to GNE myopathy. However, correlation between mutation-associated reductions in sialic acid production and disease severity is imperfect. To investigate other potential effects of GNE mutations, we compared sialic acid production in cell lines expressing wild type or mutant forms of GNE. Although we did not detect any differences attributable to disease-associated mutations, lectin binding and mass spectrometry analysis revealed that GNE deficiency is associated with unanticipated effects on the structure of cell-surface glycans. In addition to exhibiting low levels of sialylation, GNE-deficient cells produced distinct

ABO incompatibility is commonly observed in stem cell transplantation and its impact in this setting has been extensively investigated. HLA-mismatched unrelated donors (MMURD) are often used as an alternative stem cell source but are associated with increased transplant related complications. Whether ABO incompatibility affects outcome in MMURD transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients is unknown. We evaluated 1,013 AML patients who underwent MMURD transplantation between 2005 and 2014. Engraftment rates were comparable between ABO matched and mismatched patients, as were relapse incidence [34%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 28-39; for ABO matched vs. 36%; 95% CI, 32-40; for ABO mismatched; P = .32], and nonrelapse mortality (28%; 95% CI, 23-33; for ABO matched vs. 25%; 95% CI, 21-29; for ABO mismatched; P = .2). Three year survival was 40% for ABO matched and 43% for ABO mismatched patients (P = .35), Leukemia free survival rates were also comparable between groups (37%; 95% CI, 32-43; for ABO matched vs. 38%; 95% CI, 33-42; for ABO mismatched; P = .87). Incidence of grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease was marginally lower in patients with major ABO mismatching (Hazard ratio of 0.7, 95% CI, 0.5-1; P = .049]. ABO incompatibility probably has no significant clinical implications in MMURD transplantation.
PIK3CA has been extensively investigated from its molecular mechanism perspective and epidemiological association with its mutations in different types of cancers. However, little has been reported regarding the clinicopathological significance of PIK3CA expression in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In the present study, we investigated the clinicopathological significance of PIK3CA in DLBCL by performing immunohistochemical evaluation of PIK3CA in tissue microarrays consisting of 199 cases of DLBCL. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to analyze the association between PIK3CA expression and overall prognosis. To further investigate the role of PIK3CA mediated in the proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of DLBCL cells, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assays were carried out in DLBCL cell lines after successful, stable knockdown of PIK3CA using lentiviral short hairpin RNA inference. Our results indicated that although PIK3CA was shown to be extensively expressed in DLBCL, no significant association was observed between PIK3CA expression and clinical outcome or between PIK3CA expression and other clinicopathological parameters, except between performance state (PS) and phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) expression. In vitro studies revealed that in DLBCL cell lines OCI-LY8 and OCI-LY1, knockdown of PIK3CA could significantly reduce proliferation and promote apoptosis in a G1-phase arrested manner. Additionally, p27 was shown to be markedly upregulated, whereas p-AKT and cyclin D1 were found to be pronouncedly downregulated after stable knockdown of PIK3CA. Together, our results support the oncogenic property of PIK3CA in DLBCL.
PTEN is among the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancer. However, studying the role of PTEN in the pathogenesis of cancer has been limited, in part, by the paucity of human cell-based isogenic systems that faithfully model PTEN loss. In an effort to remedy this problem, gene editing was used to correct an endogenous mutant allele of PTEN in two human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines- 42MGBA and T98G. PTEN correction resulted in reduced cellular proliferation that was Akt-dependent in 42MGBA cells and Akt-independent in T98G cells. This is the first report of human cancer cell lines in which mutant PTEN has been corrected by gene editing. The isogenic sets of gene edited cell lines reported here will likely prove useful for further study of PTEN mutations in the pathogenesis of cancer, and for the discovery and validation of novel therapeutics targeting the PTEN pathway.
ATP1A3 encodes a neuron-specific human α3 subunit isoform of the sodium pump that plays an important role in neuronal excitability. Point and deletion mutations in ATP1A3 have been recognized in diverse neurological disorders. Three ATP1A3 disorders, alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC); apnea; and severe infantile epileptic encephalopathy often appear shortly after birth. To gain insight into the pathophysiology of these disorders and to understand the functional roles of the sodium pump α3 subunit in the brain in vivo during this period of development, we examined the phenotype of Atp1a3 knockout homozygous mouse fetuses (Atp1a3
CYP2D6 is one of the most studied enzymes in the field of pharmacogenetics. The CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic with over 100 catalogued star (*) alleles, and clinical CYP2D6 testing is increasingly accessible and supported by practice guidelines. However, the degree of variation at the CYP2D6 locus and homology with its pseudogenes make interrogating CYP2D6 by short-read sequencing challenging. Moreover, accurate prediction of CYP2D6 metabolizer status necessitates analysis of duplicated alleles when an increased copy number is detected. These challenges have recently been overcome by long-read CYP2D6 sequencing; however, such platforms are not widely available. This review highlights the genomic complexities of CYP2D6, current sequencing methods and the evolution of CYP2D6 from allele discovery to clinical pharmacogenetic testing.
"LOXL2 catalyzes the oxidative deamination of ε-amines of lysine and hydroxylysine residues within collagen and elastin, generating reactive aldehydes (allysine). Condensation with other allysines or lysines drives the formation of inter- and intramolecular cross-linkages, a process critical for the remodeling of the ECM. Dysregulation of this process can lead to fibrosis, and LOXL2 is known to be upregulated in fibrotic tissue. Small-molecules that directly inhibit LOXL2 catalytic activity represent a useful option for the treatment of fibrosis. Herein, we describe optimization of an initial hit 2, resulting in identification of racemic-trans-(3-((4-(aminomethyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl)oxy)phenyl)(3-fluoro-4-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl)methanone 28, a potent irreversible inhibitor of LOXL2 that is highly selective over LOX and other amine oxidases. Oral administration of 28 significantly reduced fibrosis in a 14-day mouse lung bleomycin model. The (R,R)-enantiomer 43 (PAT-1251) was selected as the clinical compound which has progressed into healthy volunteer Phase 1 trials, making it the ""first-in-class"" small-molecule LOXL2 inhibitor to enter clinical development."
CYP2C19 is a major isoform of cytochrome P450 that metabolizes a number of drugs and is involved in the glucocorticoids synthesis. CYP2C19 polymorphisms have been associated with the genetic risk for type 2 diabetes.
CYP2B6 polymorphisms that affect efavirenz (EFV) concentrations are common, but the effect of this polymorphism on HIV virologic failure in clinical practice settings has not fully been elucidated. Our objective was to investigate the relationship between the CYP2B6 516G>T genotype and late virologic failure in patients treated with EFV in Gaborone, Botswana.

FABP4 (fatty acid-binding protein 4) is an intracellular lipid chaperone involved in coordination of lipid transportation and atherogenesis. This study aimed at observing the effect of FABP4 on the 3-month outcomes in Chinese patients with acute ischemic stroke.
CYP2C19 is an important member of the cytochrome P450 enzyme superfamily. We recently identified 31 CYP2C19 alleles in the Han Chinese population. The aim of this study was to assess the catalytic activities of these allelic isoforms and their effects on the metabolism of fluoxetine in vitro.
ADCY5 mutations have been recently identified as an important cause of early-onset hyperkinetic movement disorders. The phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations in this gene is expanding. However, the ADCY5 mutational frequency in cohorts of paediatric patients with hyperkinetic movement disorders has not been evaluated.
"CAD devices are specifically designed to aid the user in the diagnostic process. Therefore, the user (e.g., clinician) is an integral part of the CAD interpretation process and the impact of CAD on users needs to be accounted for in the assessment process. We use the term ""reader performance assessment"" to denote a test specifically designed to estimate the performance of the user (or reader) interpreting CAD as part of the diagnostic process. These reader assessment studies are generally more indicative of clinical performance compared with standalone testing. In this course, we will update the audience on the latest approaches and metrics being used to assess the impact of CAD on user performance, and discuss the opinions of the AAPM CAD subcommittee on the evaluation methodologies, Learning Objectives: 1. To review the most common reader performance assessment techniques and associated performance metrics including the multireader multi-case (MRMC) study design. 2. To review the AAPM CAD subcommittee's current thinking on best practices for performing and analyzing CAD reader performance assessment studies. 3. To understand the importance and limitations of various reader performance assessment approaches and metrics for various classes of CAD devices."
SPHK1 (sphingosine kinase 1), a regulator of sphingolipid metabolites, plays a causal role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through augmenting HCC invasion and metastasis. However, the mechanism by which SPHK1 signaling promotes invasion and metastasis in HCC remains to be clarified. Here, we reported that SPHK1 induced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by accelerating CDH1/E-cadherin lysosomal degradation and facilitating the invasion and metastasis of HepG2 cells. Initially, we found that SPHK1 promoted cell migration and invasion and induced the EMT process through decreasing the expression of CDH1, which is an epithelial marker. Furthermore, SPHK1 accelerated the lysosomal degradation of CDH1 to induce EMT, which depended on TRAF2 (TNF receptor associated factor 2)-mediated macroautophagy/autophagy activation. In addition, the inhibition of autophagy recovered CDH1 expression and reduced cell migration and invasion through delaying the degradation of CDH1 in SPHK1-overexpressing cells. Moreover, the overexpression of SPHK1 produced intracellular sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). In response to S1P stimulation, TRAF2 bound to BECN1/Beclin 1 and catalyzed the lysine 63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1 for triggering autophagy. The deletion of the RING domain of TRAF2 inhibited autophagy and the interaction of BECN1 and TRAF2. Our findings define a novel mechanism responsible for the regulation of the EMT via SPHK1-TRAF2-BECN1-CDH1 signal cascades in HCC cells. Our work indicates that the blockage of SPHK1 activity to attenuate autophagy may be a promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of HCC.
CYP2D6 is one of the major enzymes in the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system. It metabolizes ∼25% of prescribed drugs and hence, the genetic diversity of a CYP2D6 gene has continued to be of great interest to the medical and pharmaceutical industries. This study was designed to perform a systematic analysis of the CYP2D6 gene in six subtribes of the Malaysian Orang Asli.
CYP11B2 is a key enzyme involved in the synthesis of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. CYP11B2 expression in the adrenal glands is controlled by the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and plays an important role in the maintenance of electrolyte metabolism in higher organisms. Abnormal overexpression of CYP11B2 results in the disruption of mineral balance and can lead to hypertension. Though the molecular mechanism of the regulation of CYP11B2 expression has remained elusive, we hypothesize that compounds that prevent CYP11B2 expression could represent a novel class of antihypertensive drugs. In this study, we established a high-throughput screening system to identify such compounds, and subsequently carried out chemical screening. We found that the ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor bortezomib could suppress CYP11B2 expression and secretion of aldosterone induced by angiotensin II (Ang II) in adrenocortical H295R cells. Moreover, bortezomib down-regulated the Cyp11b2 mRNA expression facilitated in the adrenal gland of Tsukuba hypertensive mice, resulting in subsequent lowering of their blood pressures. Furthermore, we observed the characteristic alteration of H3K27ac in the adrenal CYP11B2 gene promoter induced by Ang II stimulation, which was found to be disrupted by bortezomib. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility of developing novel antihypertensive drugs that prevent CYP11B2 expression.
CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms have been reported to be strongly associated with the tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in adult kidney transplantation. However, there is no published meta-analysis in the influence of CYP3A5 variants on the requirements of the tacrolimus dose in pediatric renal-transplant recipients (RTRs). We wished to determine the effects of CYP3A5 polymorphisms on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in pediatric RTRs.
ACE inhibitors are considered first line of treatment in patients with many forms of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Other antihypertensives such as calcium channel blockers achieve similar therapeutic effectiveness in attenuating hypertension-related renal damage progression. Our objective was to explore the value of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of renal AT1 receptor (AT1R) to guide therapy in the 5/6 subtotal-nephrectomy (Nx) rat model of CKD. Ten weeks after Nx, Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 10mg/kg/d enalapril (NxE), 30mg/kg/d diltiazem (NxD) or left untreated (Nx) for an additional 8-10 weeks. Kidney AT1R expression was assessed using in vivo [18F]fluoropyridine-losartan PET and in vitro autoradiography. Compared to shams, Nx rats exhibited higher systolic blood pressure that was reduced by both enalapril and diltiazem. At 18-20 weeks, plasma creatinine and albuminuria were significantly increased in Nx, reduced to sham levels in NxE, but enhanced in NxD rats. Enalapril treatment decreased kidney angiotensin II whereas diltiazem induced significant elevations in plasma and kidney levels. Reduced PET renal AT1R levels in Nx were normalized by enalapril but not diltiazem, and results were supported by autoradiography. Reduction of renal blood flow in Nx was restored by enalapril, while no difference was observed in myocardial blood flow amongst groups. Enhanced left ventricle mass in Nx was not reversed by enalapril but was augmented with diltiazem. Stroke volume was diminished in untreated Nx compared to shams and restored with both therapies. [18F]Fluoropyridine-Losartan PET allowed in vivo quantification of kidney AT1R changes associated with progression of CKD and with various pharmacotherapies.
ACO2 encodes aconitase 2, catalyzing the second step of the tricarboxylic acid. To date, there are only 6 reported families with 5 unique ACO2 mutations. Affected individuals can develop intellectual disability, epilepsy, brain atrophy, hypotonia, ataxia, optic atrophy, and retinal degeneration. Here, we report an 18-year-old boy with a novel ACO2 variant discovered on whole-exome sequencing. He presented with childhood-onset ataxia, impaired self-help skills comparable to severe-profound intellectual disability, intractable epilepsy, cerebellar atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy, and pigmentary retinopathy. His variant is the sixth unique ACO2 mutation. In addition, compared to mild cases (isolated optic atrophy) and severe cases (infantile death), our patient may be moderately affected, evident by increased survival and some preserved cognition (ability to speak full sentences and follow commands), which is a novel presentation. This case expands the disease spectrum to include increased survival with partly spared cognition.
CYP3A4 is one of the major drug-metabolizing enzymes in human and is responsible for the metabolism of 60% of clinically used drugs. Many drugs are able to induce the expression of CYP3A4, which usually causes drug-drug interactions and adverse drug reactions. This study aims to explore the role of histone modifications in rifampicin-induced expression of CYP3A4 in LS174T cells. We found that the induction of CYP3A4 mRNA (4- to 15-fold) by rifampicin in LS174T cells was associated with increased levels of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3, above 1.8-fold) and H3 acetylation (above 2-fold) and a decreased level of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3, about 50%) in the

SLC1A5 (solute carrier family 1, member 5) is a small neutral amino acid exchanger that is upregulated in rapidly proliferating lymphocytes but also in many primary human cancers. Furthermore, cancer cell lines have been shown to require SLC1A5 for their survival 
ABCG2 is a constitutively expressed ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that protects many tissues against xenobiotic molecules. Its activity affects the pharmacokinetics of commonly used drugs and limits the delivery of therapeutics into tumour cells, thus contributing to multidrug resistance. Here we present the structure of human ABCG2 determined by cryo-electron microscopy, providing the first high-resolution insight into a human multidrug transporter. We visualize ABCG2 in complex with two antigen-binding fragments of the human-specific, inhibitory antibody 5D3 that recognizes extracellular loops of the transporter. We observe two cholesterol molecules bound in the multidrug-binding pocket that is located in a central, hydrophobic, inward-facing translocation pathway between the transmembrane domains. Combined with functional in vitro analyses, our results suggest a multidrug recognition and transport mechanism of ABCG2, rationalize disease-causing single nucleotide polymorphisms and the allosteric inhibition by the 5D3 antibody, and provide the structural basis of cholesterol recognition by other G-subfamily ABC transporters.
SLC26A3 [downregulated in adenoma (DRA)] plays a key role in mammalian intestinal NaCl absorption, in that it mediates apical membrane Cl
GMPPA encodes the GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase A protein (GMPPA). The function of GMPPA is not well defined, however it is a homolog of GMPPB which catalyzes the reaction that converts mannose-1-phosphate and guanosine-5'-triphosphate to GDP-mannose. Previously, biallelic mutations in GMPPA were reported to cause a disorder characterized by achalasia, alacrima, neurological deficits, and intellectual disability. In this study, we report a female proband with achalasia, alacrima, hypohydrosis, apparent intellectual disability, seizures, microcephaly, esotropia, and craniofacial dysmorphism. Exome sequencing identified a previously unreported homozygous c.853+1G>A variant in GMPPA in the proband and her affected sister. Their unaffected parents were heterozygous, and unaffected brother homozygous wild type for this variant. Lymphoblast cells from the affected sisters showed complete loss of the GMPPA protein by Western blotting, and increased levels of GDP-mannose in lymphoblasts on high performance liquid chromatography. Based on our findings and the previous report describing patients with an overlapping phenotype, we conclude that this novel variant in GMPPA, identified by exome sequencing in the proband and her affected sister, is the genetic cause of their phenotype and may expand the known phenotype of this recently described glycosylation disorder.
NQO1 is a FAD-binding protein that can form homodimers and reduce quinones to hydroquinones, and a growing body of evidence currently suggests that NQO1 is dramatically elevated in solid cancers. Here, we demonstrated that NQO1 was elevated in breast cancer and that its expression level was positively correlated with invasion and reduced disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates. Next, we found that β-lapachone exerted significant anti-proliferation and anti-metastasis effects in breast cancer cell lines due to its effects on NQO1 expression. Moreover, we revealed that the anti-cancer effects of β-lapachone were mediated by the inactivation of the Akt/mTOR pathway. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that NQO1 could be a useful prognostic biomarker for patients with breast cancer, and its bioactivatable drug, β-lapachone represented a promising new development and an effective strategy for indicating the progression of NQO1-positive breast cancers.
CYP2J2 is highly expressed in cardiovascular tissue including the heart and vascular endothelial cells. CYP2J2 and the EETs have been shown owning diverse biological effects. Our previous study found that ophiopogonin D (OP-D) suppressed drug-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by upregulating the levels of CYP2J3/EETs in cardiomyocytes. The aim of this research was to investigate whether CYP2J2/EETs-PPARα pathway involved in endothelium protective effects of OP-D in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The results showed that OP-D significantly inhibited Ang II induced NF-κB nuclear translocation, IκBα down-regulation and activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and VCAM-1) by increasing the expression of CYP2J2/EETs and PPARα in HUVECs. Furthermore, treatment with exogenous 11,12-EET attenuated endothelial inflammation induced by Ang II as evidenced by inhibited NF-κB nuclear translocation, increased IκBα expression and decreased inflammation factor level. Finally, the activation of NF-κB nuclear translocation induced by Ang II was also markedly suppressed by fenofibrate. Co-incubation with 6-(2-proparglyloxyphenyl) hexanoic acid (PPOH) and PPARα inhibitor GW6471 before drug treatment abolished the endothelium protective effects of OP-D. Taken together, these data suggest that OP-D has the endothelial protective effect through activation of CYP2J and increasing EETs, and PPARα involves in this process.
CYP24A1 (25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase) is a useful enzyme target for a range of medical conditions including cancer, cardiovascular and autoimmune disease, which show elevated CYP24A1 levels and corresponding reduction of calcitriol (the biologically active form of vitamin D). A series of (E)-N-(2-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-2-(phenylethyl)-3/4-styrylbenzamides have been synthesised using an efficient synthetic route and shown to be potent inhibitors of CYP24A1 (IC
CYP2D6 is one of the most significant polymorphic genes of drugmetabolizing enzymes due to its association with different metabolic activities and the pharmacokinetics of CYP2D6 substrates.
PTEN is the second most frequently mutated tumor suppresser gene in cancers after p53. Genetic and epigenetic alterations in the PTEN gene and its regulatory regions have been reported in various studies. PTEN is a crucial downregulator of the pro-survival phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and also suppresses insulin signaling. Failure to regulate these pathways leads to increase in cell proliferation and migration which in turn promotes tumorigenesis. PTEN underexpression is mediated by a variety of cytokines and stress kinases which seem to collectively induce the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, reduced expression of PTEN is seen in nearly half of the cases on average. In some cases, PTEN has been observed to be either mutated or methylated which can also lead to reduced expression or in some cases, complete loss of expression. On the cellular level, PTEN is also a target in the pathogenic pathway of hepatitis C virus core protein and hepatitis B virus X protein. These viruses appear to alter PTEN regulation and pro-apoptotic ability to enhance the process of tumor formation. In perspective of the crucial role PTEN plays in balancing proliferation and apoptosis, we propose PTEN as a valuable marker in the diagnosis, assessment of tumor grade, and disease stage in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
CYP2D6 plays an important role in the metabolism of many drugs such as opioids and antidepressants. Polymorphisms of the CYP2D6 gene are widely observed in the Japanese population, and can affect the first-pass metabolism of orally administered drugs. Several CYP enzymes have been identified in the small intestine of Caucasians, but intestinal CYP enzymes have not been reported in the Japanese population, except for CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. In this study, we evaluated the CYP2D6 metabolic capacity by measurement of CYP2D6 mRNA and protein levels and activity in the small intestine of Japanese individuals. Normal jejunal tissues were obtained from 31 patients who had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy, and the CYP2D6*10 variant was identified in these tissues. CYP2D6 mRNA and CYP2D6 protein levels were analyzed using real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation, a marker of CYP2D6 activity, was analyzed using HPLC. Frequencies of the CYP2D6*1/*1, *1/*10, and *10/*10 genotypes in the jejunal tissue were 29.0% (n=9), 35.5% (n=11), and 35.5% (n=11), respectively. CYP2D6 protein and activity levels did not differ significantly between the genotypes. A positive correlation was found between CYP2D6 protein and activity levels. Furthermore, CYP2D6 protein levels and activity in the small intestine were significantly lower than those in the liver. These findings suggest that the metabolic capacity of CYP2D6 in the small intestine of the Japanese population has a relatively small effect on drug metabolism.
SMYD3 is a methyltransferase highly expressed in many types of cancer. It usually functions as an oncogenic protein to promote cell cycle, cell proliferation, and metastasis. Here, we show that SMYD3 modulates another hallmark of cancer, DNA repair, by stimulating transcription of genes involved in multiple steps of homologous recombination. Deficiency of SMYD3 induces DNA-damage hypersensitivity, decreases levels of repair foci, and leads to impairment of homologous recombination. Moreover, the regulation of homologous recombination-related genes is via the methylation of H3K4 at the target gene promoters. These data imply that, besides its reported oncogenic abilities, SMYD3 may maintain genome integrity by ensuring expression levels of HR proteins to cope with the high demand of restart of stalled replication forks in cancers.
PTEN is a tumour suppressor that is frequently mutated in a variety of cancers. Hence, PTEN has significant potential as a therapeutic molecule. PTEN-long is an alternative translation variant, with an additional 173 amino acids added to the N-terminal of the canonical PTEN when CUG of the mRNA is utilized as the start codon. PTEN-long is secreted into serum and can re-enter cells throughout the body. One of the major barriers for gene therapy is to efficiently and specifically deliver DNA or RNA material to target cells. As an alternative approach, if a therapeutic protein can be directly delivered to target cell of interest, it should theoretically function well within the cells, particularly for genes that are deficiently expressed in vivo. Most therapeutic proteins are incapable of efficiently permeating the cell membrane. In this study, we have employed CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool combined with single-stranded template to edit CTG of PTEN-long to ATG in the genome. Two guide RNAs close to CTG site were found to have similar efficiency in driving PTEN-long expression. Furthermore, we detected PTEN-long expression in transfected whole-cell lysate and in concentrated culture media in Western blot. Interestingly, the culture media of PTEN-long expression can reduce Akt phosphorylation level and repress U87 cell proliferation compared to wild-type U87 or control media. Taken together, PTEN-long driven by CRISPR/Cas9 imports and exports cells and represses nearby cell proliferation, indicating the PTEN-long generated by CRISPR/Cas9 has potential to be an alternative strategy for PTEN gene therapy.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homology deleted on chromosome 10) has multiple functions, and recent studies have shown that the PTEN family has isoforms. The roles of these PTEN family members in biologic activities warrant specific evaluation. Here, we show that PTENα maintains CaMKII in a state that is competent to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) with resultant regulation of contextual fear memory and spatial learning. PTENα binds to CaMKII with its distinctive N terminus and resets CaMKII to an activatable state by dephosphorylating it at sites T305/306. Loss of PTENα impedes the interaction of CaMKII and NR2B, leading to defects in hippocampal LTP, fear-conditioned memory, and spatial learning. Restoration of PTENα in the hippocampus of PTENα-deficient mice rescues learning deficits through regulation of CaMKII. CaMKII mutations in dementia patients inhibit CaMKII activity and result in disruption of PTENα-CaMKII-NR2B signaling. We propose that CaMKII is a target of PTENα phosphatase and that PTENα is an essential element in the molecular regulation of neural activity.
UCP2 maps nearby the lod score peak of STR1-stroke QTL in the SHRSP rat strain. We explored the potential contribution of UCP2 to the high-salt diet (JD)-dependent increased stroke susceptibility of SHRSP. Male SHRSP, SHRSR, two reciprocal SHRSR/SHRSP-STR1/QTL stroke congenic lines received JD for 4 weeks to detect brain UCP2 gene/protein modulation as compared with regular diet (RD). Brains were also analyzed for NF-κB protein expression, oxidative stress level and UCP2-targeted microRNAs expression level. Next, based on knowledge that fenofibrate and Brassica Oleracea (BO) stimulate UCP2 expression through PPARα activation, we monitored stroke occurrence in SHRSP receiving JD plus fenofibrate versus vehicle, JD plus BO juice versus BO juice plus PPARα inhibitor. Brain UCP2 expression was markedly reduced by JD in SHRSP and in the (SHRsr.SHRsp-(D1Rat134-Mt1pa)) congenic line, whereas NF-κB expression and oxidative stress level increased. The opposite phenomenon was observed in the SHRSR and in the (SHRsp.SHRsr-(D1Rat134-Mt1pa)) reciprocal congenic line. Interestingly, the UCP2-targeted rno-microRNA-503 was significantly upregulated in SHRSP and decreased in SHRSR upon JD, with consistent changes in the two reciprocal congenic lines. Both fenofibrate and BO significantly decreased brain microRNA-503 level, upregulated UCP2 expression and protected SHRSP from stroke occurrence. In vitro overexpression of microRNA-503 in endothelial cells suppressed UCP2 expression and led to a significant increase of cell mortality with decreased cell viability. Brain UCP2 downregulation is a determinant of increased stroke predisposition in high-salt-fed SHRSP. In this context, UCP2 can be modulated by both pharmacological and nutraceutical agents. The microRNA-503 significantly contributes to mediate brain UCP2 downregulation in JD-fed SHRSP.
GNE myopathy is a rare, autosomal recessive, inborn error of sialic acid metabolism, caused by mutations in GNE, the gene encoding UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase. The disease manifests as an adult-onset myopathy characterized by progressive skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy. There is no medical therapy available for this debilitating disease. Hyposialylation of muscle glycoproteins likely contributes to the pathophysiology of this disease. N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAc), an uncharged monosaccharide and the first committed precursor in the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway, is a therapeutic candidate that prevents muscle weakness in the mouse model of GNE myopathy. We conducted a first-in-human, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-ascending dose study to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics of ManNAc in GNE myopathy subjects. Single doses of 3 and 6g of oral ManNAc were safe and well tolerated; 10g was associated with diarrhea likely due to unabsorbed ManNAc. Oral ManNAc was absorbed rapidly and exhibited a short half-life (~2.4h). Following administration of a single dose of ManNAc, there was a significant and sustained increase in plasma unconjugated free sialic acid (Neu5Ac) (T
ADH1B Arg48His polymorphism is associated with the development of alcohol-related diseases. In this study, we aimed to explore an improved polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers (PCR-CTPP) assay for the detection of ADH1B Arg48His polymorphism.
SDHD promoter mutations were reported in 4-10% of cutaneous melanomas. The advanced clinico-pathological and patient survival association with SDHD mutation and/or expression in cutaneous melanoma remains controversial.
SLC19A3 deficiency, also called thiamine metabolism dysfunction syndrome-2 (THMD2; OMIM 607483), is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in SLC19A3, the gene encoding thiamine transporter 2. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration in SLC19A3 deficiency and whether administration of high-dose thiamine prevents neurodegeneration, we generated homozygous Slc19a3 E314Q knock-in (KI) mice harboring the mutation corresponding to the human SLC19A3 E320Q, which is associated with the severe form of THMD2. Homozygous KI mice and previously reported homozygous Slc19a3 knock-out (KO) mice fed a thiamine-restricted diet (thiamine: 0.60 mg/100 g food) died within 30 and 12 days, respectively, with dramatically decreased thiamine concentration in the blood and brain, acute neurodegeneration, and astrogliosis in the submedial nucleus of the thalamus and ventral anterior-lateral complex of the thalamus. These findings may bear some features of thiamine-deficient mice generated by pyrithiamine injection and a thiamine-deficient diet, suggesting that the primary cause of THMD2 could be thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) deficiency. Next, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of high-dose thiamine treatment. When the diet was reverted to a conventional diet (thiamine: 1.71 mg/100 g food) after thiamine restriction, all homozygous KO mice died. In contrast, when the diet was changed to a high-thiamine diet (thiamine: 8.50 mg/100 g food) after thiamine restriction, more than half of homozygous KO mice survived, without progression of brain lesions. Unexpectedly, when the high-thiamine diet of recovered mice was reverted to a conventional diet, some homozygous KO mice died. These results showed that acute neurodegeneration caused by thiamine deficiency is preventable in most parts, and prompt high-dose thiamine administration is critical for the treatment of THMD2. However, reduction of thiamine should be performed carefully to prevent recurrence after recovery of the disease.
ABO blood types are associated with the prognosis of several malignancies. However, the role of the ABO blood type in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the prognostic role of the ABO blood group in 691 HCC patients after hepatectomy by Cox regression analysis. A prognostic nomogram was generated to predict the 3 and 5-year overall survival (OS). A total of 262 HCC patients (37.9%) had blood group O, 199 (28.8%) had blood group A, 165 (23.9%) had blood group B, and 65 (9.4%) had blood group AB. The median OS was 55 months in patients with blood group O, 39 months for blood group A, 34 months for blood group B, and 34 months for blood group AB patients (P = 0.001, log-rank test). There were significant differences in OS between patients with blood groups O and A [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.416; 95% CI, 1.101-1.820; P = 0.007], blood group B (HR = 1.736; 95% CI, 1.333-2.262; P < 0.001), blood group AB (HR = 1.739; 95% CI, 1.210-2.499; P = 0.003) and non-O blood groups (HR = 1.485; 95% CI, 1.204-1.830; P < 0.001). Our constructed nomogram (c-index = 0.687) predicted the prognosis more accurately than the TNM stage alone(c-index = 0.601). In conclusion, non-O blood groups are poor prognostic indicators for HCC following hepatectomy. Our findings justify further external validation in larger cohorts.
DIO3 and DIO3OS are two imprinted genes identified in mouse and humans. The DIO3 gene, which encodes for the type 3 deiodinase, is preferentially expressed from the paternal allele, while the DIO3OS transcript is transcribed in opposite orientation to DIO3, multiple noncoding and alternatively splicing isoforms from maternal allele. In this study, the five splice variants of DIO3OS were identified in Holstein cattle and had complex, tissue-specific expression patterns observed in eight tissues, including heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, muscle, fat and brain. In the G+C rich region, upstream from the cattle DIO3 gene, there were three small conserved regions and some promoter elements similar to those observed in mouse and humans. An allele-specific expression analysis-based SNP method revealed that DIO3 and DIO3OS genes exhibited monoallelic expression in the eight tissues, indicating that DIO3 and DIO3OS are imprinted in cattle.
ABO and HLA antibody incompatible (HLAi) renal transplants (AIT) now comprise around 10% of living donor kidney transplants. However, the relationship between pretransplant factors and medium-term outcomes are not fully understood, especially in relation to factors that may vary between centers.
FUT2 is a gene for a fucosyltransferase that encodes expression of ABO blood group antigens found on gastrointestinal mucosa and secretions. We hypothesized that the fecal microbiomes of healthy subjects, with blood group antigens A, B, and O, have differing compositions. We analyzed 33 fecal and blood specimens from healthy subjects for FUT2 genotype, and the fecal microbiome was determined by 454 pyrosequencing. Our data show that being a blood group secretor is associated with less diversity at higher orders of taxonomy; and the presence of blood group A antigens in the secretor subjects are associated with an expansion families of bacteria within the gut. Furthermore, our study confirms the previous findings that secretors and nonsecretors have differing bacterial taxa. This extends the previous findings by demonstrating that the impact of being a nonsecretor is higher than that of individual blood group antigens. Additionally, we demonstrate that both secretor status and blood group antigen expression especially affect the Lachnospiraceae family of bacteria within the gut microbiome, with lower abundances noted in nonsecretors and higher abundances in secretors of various blood groups. We further note specific differences in blood group A-secretors demonstrating that the genus

PNPLA3 I148M polymorphism (rs738409 C>G) is the most important and best-known polymorphism for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, little is known about the effect of this polymorphism on NAFLD after liver transplantation (LT). We aimed to evaluate the association between this polymorphism and post-LT NAFLD.

CD36 is a scavenger receptor located on monocytes which is involved in foam cell transformation.
PTEN pseudogene (PTENP1) has a tumor suppressive role in multiple cancers. However, its involvement in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains largely unknown. In this study, we set out to identify the role of PTENP1 in the development of ESCC. Gene Expression Omnibus database was employed to investigate the expression of PTENP1 in ESCC. sRNA target Database (StarBase v2.0) was used to query the downstream of PTENP1. Next, both in vitro and in vivo experiments were employed to explore the function. Cell proliferation was evaluated by CCK-8, soft agar, and colony formation assays. Expression of relative genes was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. 3'UTR luciferase assay was used to confirm the miRNA binding. The clinical significance of PTENP1 was further validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlation with clinicopathological indicators in additional samples (n = 93). We found expression of PTENP1 in ESCC was lower than that in the corresponding adjacent normal tissues (n = 17). Overexpression of PTENP1 in Eca109 and TE-1 cells resulted in inhibited proliferation and altered expression of SOCS6-p-STAT3-HIF-1α pathway both in vitro and in vivo. Subsequent IHC reported a similar trend in human ESCC samples. 3'UTR luciferase assay demonstrated that PTENP1 3'UTR decoyed miR-17-5p from binding to SOCS6. Moreover, PTENP1 expression was correlated with clinicopathological indicators to varying degrees, including histological grade, TNM stage, infiltration depth, lymph node metastasis, and overall survival. Taken together, these results suggested an anti-oncogenic role of PTENP1. Meanwhile, PTENP1 may also serve as a candidate of prognostic indicator for ESCC patients.
ABO and Rhesus blood systems are associated with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2). Gestational Diabetes (GDM) is a model to study DM.
PTEN controls three-dimensional (3D) glandular morphogenesis by coupling juxtamembrane signaling to mitotic spindle machinery. While molecular mechanisms remain unclear, PTEN interacts through its C2 membrane-binding domain with the scaffold protein β-Arrestin1. Because β-Arrestin1 binds and suppresses the Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein ARHGAP21, we hypothesize that PTEN controls Cdc42 -dependent morphogenic processes through a β-Arrestin1-ARHGAP21 complex. Here, we show that PTEN knockdown (KD) impairs β-Arrestin1 membrane localization, β-Arrestin1-ARHGAP21 interactions, Cdc42 activation, mitotic spindle orientation and 3D glandular morphogenesis. Effects of PTEN deficiency were phenocopied by β-Arrestin1 KD or inhibition of β-Arrestin1-ARHGAP21 interactions. Conversely, silencing of ARHGAP21 enhanced Cdc42 activation and rescued aberrant morphogenic processes of PTEN-deficient cultures. Expression of the PTEN C2 domain mimicked effects of full-length PTEN but a membrane-binding defective mutant of the C2 domain abrogated these properties. Our results show that PTEN controls multicellular assembly through a membrane-associated regulatory protein complex composed of β-Arrestin1, ARHGAP21 and Cdc42.
PTEN and KLLN are two tumor suppressor genes located in 10q23, share a bidirectional promoter and have roles in carcinogenesis. Formerly, the role of PTEN mutations and KLLN epimutations were identified in incidence of thyroid lesions in individuals with Cowden syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder. This study is the first of its type to assess PTEN and KLLN circulating levels in patients with sporadic papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and compare to patients with multinodular goiter (MNG) and healthy individuals.
CYP2C9 is a human microsomal cytochrome P450c (CYP). Much of the variation in CYP2C9 levels and activity can be attributed to polymorphisms of this gene. Wild-type CYP2C9 and mutants were coexpressed with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in Escherichia coli. The hydroxylase activities toward 7-ethoxycoumarin, flavanone and steroids were examined. Six CYP2C9 variants showed Soret peaks (450 nm) typical of P450 in reduced CO-difference spectra. CYP2C9.38 had the highest 7-ethoxycoumarin de-ethylase activity. All the CYP2C9 variants showed lower flavanone 6-hydroxylation activities than CYP2C9.1 (the wild-type). CYP2C9.38 showed higher activities in testosterone 6β-hydroxylation, progesterone 6β-/16α-hydroxylation, estrone 11α-hydroxylation and estradiol 6α-hydroxylation than CYP2C9.1. CYP2C9.40 showed higher testosterone 17-oxidase activity than CYP2C9.1; CYP2C9.8 showed higher estrone 16α-hydroxylase activity and CYP2C9.12 showed higher estrone 11α-hydroxylase activity. CYP2C9.9 and CYP2C9.10 showed similar activities to CYP2C9.1. These results indicate that the substrate specificity of CYP2C9.9 and CYP2C9.10 was not changed, but CYP2C9.8, CYP2C9.12 and CYP2C9.40 showed different substrate specificity toward steroids compared with CYP2C9.1; and especially CYP2C9.38 displayed diverse substrate specificities towards 7-ethoxycoumarin and steroids.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene well characterized as a phosphatase. However, more evidences demonstrate PTEN functions in DNA repair independent of its phosphatase activity, which affects the efficacy of DNA damage anti-tumoral drugs in treating cancer cells with PTEN variations. Using BT549 breast cancer cells, we studied the roles of PTEN in DNA repair and in sensitization of breast cancer cells to olaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. Comet assay showed PTEN promoted DNA repair. PTEN-deficient BT549 cells are sensitive to olaparib, which shows the synthetic lethality between PTEN and PARP1. We expressed PTEN in BT549 cells and found PTEN-proficient BT549 cells resist to olaparib. Western blot showed that PTEN up-regulated Rad51 expression, suggesting PTEN promotes DNA repair through Rad51-dependnent homologous recombination. We used 5μM olaparib or 5μM RI-1, a Rad51 inhibitor, to treat PTEN-proficient BT549 cells respectively. The immunofluorescent analysis showed the combination of olaparib and RI-1 induced more than 4-fold of γH2AX foci than either of them. MTT assay showed 5μM RI-1 did not change the survival of PTEN-proficient BT549 cells, however, this dose of RI-1 sensitized PTEN-proficient BT549 cells to olaparib. Consequently, these results demonstrate that inhibition of Rad51 can sensitize BT549 cells with wild type PTEN to olaparib, which would contribute to using PARP inhibitors in individual treatment of breast cancer patients with PTEN variations.
FLVCR1 encodes for a ubiquitous heme exporter, whose recessive mutations cause posterior column ataxia with retinitis pigmentosa (PCARP). Recently, FLVCR1 recessive mutations were also found in two sporadic children with hereditary sensory-autonomic neuropathy (HSAN). We report the unique case of a 33-year-old Italian woman with a combination of typical PCARP, sensory-autonomic neuropathy with sensory loss to all modalities and multiple autonomic dysfuctions, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. Molecular analysis demonstrated homozygosity for the previously identified FLVCR1 p.Pro221Ser variation. The same variation, in combination with a frameshift mutation, was previously identified in an Italian child with HSAN. Functional studies carried out on patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines showed decreased FLVCR1a transcript, increased reactive oxygen species, excessive intracellular heme accumulation, and increased number of Annexin V positive cells. This indicates that the homozygous p.Pro221Ser FLVCR1 variation compromises the ability of FLVCR1a to export heme leading to enhanced susceptibility to programmed cell death. Our study demonstrates the existence of a phenotypic continuum among the discrete disorders previously linked to FLVCR1 mutations, and suggests that the related alteration of heme metabolism may lead to the degeneration of specific neuronal cell populations.
ELOVL3 is involved in elongating saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, and is a critical enzyme for lipid accumulation in brown adipocytes during the early phase of tissue recruitment. In addition, ELOVL3 is related to increased fatty acid oxidation in brown adipocytes. However, the potential functions of ELOVL3 in bovine cells remain unclear. Herein, we aimed to elucidate the effect of the ELOVL3 on the differentiation of bovine skeletal muscle-derived satellite cells (MDSCs). Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses were used for elucidating ELOVL3 expression pattern in bovine MDSCs during differentiation in vitro. We activated or inhibited ELOVL3 to study the effect of alterations in its expression on in vitro differentiation of bovine MDSCs. ELOVL3 expression increased gradually during bovine MDSC differentiation, and its levels were higher in the more highly differentiated myotubes. Activation of ELOVL3 promoted MDSC differentiation, while inhibition of ELOVL3 hindered differentiation of these cells. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate the importance of ELOVL3 during bovine MDSC differentiation, which may assist in increasing beef cattle muscularity.
SMYD3 is a member of the SET and myeloid-Nervy-DEAF-1 (MYND) domain-containing protein family of methyltransferases, which are known to play critical roles in carcinogenesis. Expression of SMYD3 is elevated in various cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and is correlated with the survival time of patients with ESCC. Here, we dissect gene expression data, from a previously described KYSE150 ESCC cell line in which SMYD3 had been knocked down, by integration with the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, to find the new potential biological roles of SMYD3 and subsequent target genes. By construction of a specific PPI network, differentially expressed genes (DEGs), following SMYD3 knockdown, were identified as interacting with thousands of neighboring proteins. Enrichment analyses from the DAVID Functional Annotation Chart found significant Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with transcription activities, which were closely related to SMYD3 function. For example, YAP1 and GATA3 might be a target gene for SMYD3 to regulate transcription. Enrichment annotation of the total DEG PPI network by GO 'Biological Process' generated a connected functional map and found 532 significant terms, including known and potential biological roles of SMYD3 protein, such as expression regulation, signal transduction, cell cycle, cell metastasis, and invasion. Subcellular localization analyses found that DEGs and their interacting proteins were distributed in multiple layers, which might reflect the intricate biological processes at the spatial level. Our analysis of the PPI network has provided important clues for future detection of the biological roles and mechanisms, as well as the target genes of SMYD3.
CD36 signal transduction modulates the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and foam cell formation. We previously observed that 7-ketocholesteryl-9-carboxynonanoate (oxLig-1), the lipid moiety of oxLDL, activates the CD36-Src-JNK/ERK1/2 signalling pathway. In this study, we assessed the role of the ω-carboxyl group in the binding of oxLig-1 to CD36 and investigated whether the binding of the ω-carboxyl group to CD36 triggers CD36-mediated signalling, thereby resulting in the upregulation of caveolin-1 expression. Our results showed that oxLig-1 bound to CD36 and that the ω-carboxyl group was critical for this binding. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses showed that interaction between the ω-carboxyl group of oxLig-1 and CD36 triggered intracellular Src-JNK/ERK1/2 signal transduction. Moreover, the binding of the ω-carboxyl group to CD36 induced caveolin-1 expression and translocation to the membrane in macrophages. Additionally, inhibitors of Src, JNK and ERK and siRNA targeting CD36 and NF-κB significantly suppressed the enhanced caveolin-1 expression induced by oxLig-1. In conclusion, these observations suggest that oxLig-1 is a critical epitope of oxLDL that mediates the binding of oxLDL to CD36 and activates downstream Src-JNK/ERK1/2-NF-κB signal transduction, resulting in upregulation of caveolin-1 expression in macrophages.
AQP9 is an aquaglyceroporin with a very broad substrate spectrum. In addition to its orthodox nutrient substrates, AQP9 also transports multiple neutral and ionic arsenic species including arsenic trioxide, monomethylarsenous acid (MAs
CYP24A1 and CYP27B1 are critical genes determining 1α,25(OH)
SLC10A1 codes for the sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), which is a hepatocellular transporter for bile acids (BAs) and the receptor for hepatitis B and D viruses. NTCP is also a target of multiple drugs. We aimed to evaluate the medical consequences of the loss of function mutation p.Ser267Phe in SLC10A1. We identified eight individuals with homozygous p.Ser267Phe mutation in SLC10A1 and followed up for 8-90 months. We compared their total serum BAs and 6 species of BAs with 170 wild-type and 107 heterozygous healthy individuals. We performed in-depth medical examinations and exome sequencing in the homozygous individuals. All homozygous individuals had persistent hypercholanemia (P = 5.8 × 10
ABO and its paralogues, such as A3GALT2 and GGTA1, encoding α1,3-Gal(NAc) transferases, belong to the glycosyltransferase 6 (GT6) gene family. We have developed an alternative method for the identification of species based on sequence variations within the GT6 gene family, which is applicable to degraded DNA.
AOX1 and AOX2 genes are thought to play different physiological roles. Whereas AOX1 is typically expected to associate to stress and growth responses, AOX2 was more often found to be linked to development and housekeeping functions. However, this view is questioned by several adverse observations. For example, co-regulated expression for DcAOX1 and DcAOX2a genes was recently reported during growth induction in carrot (Daucus carota L.). Early expression peaks for both genes during the lag phase of growth coincided with a critical time point for biomass prediction, a result achieved by applying calorespirometry. The effect of both AOX family member genes cannot easily be separated. However, separate functional analysis is required in order to identify important gene-specific polymorphisms or patterns of polymorphisms for functional marker development and its use in breeding. Specifically, a methodology is missing that enables studying functional effects of individual genes or polymorphisms/polymorphic patterns on early growth regulation.This protocol aims to provide the means for identifying plant alternative oxidase (AOX) gene variants as functional markers for early growth regulation. Prerequisite for applying this protocol is available Schizosaccharomyces pombe strains that were transformed with individual AOX genes following published protocols from Anthony Moore's group (Albury et al., J Biol Chem 271:17062-17066, 1996; Affourtit et al., J Biol Chem 274:6212-6218, 1999). The novelty of the present protocol comes by modifying yeast cell densities in a way that allows studying critical qualitative and quantitative effects of AOX gene variants (isoenzymes or polymorphic genes) during the early phase of growth. Calorimetry is used as a novel tool to confirm differences obtained by optical density measurements in early growth regulation by metabolic phenotyping (released heat rates). This protocol enables discriminating between AOX genes that inhibit growth and AOX genes that enhance growth under comparable conditions. It also allows studying dependency of AOX gene effects on gene copy number. The protocol can also be combined with laser microdissection of individual cells from target tissues for specified breeding traits.
ESD allows higher rates of en-bloc and R0 resections, but has occasionally complications such as aspiration pneumonia. Factors associated with aspiration pneumonia are not completely understood.
ABO blood type is an inherited characteristic. The associations between ABO blood type and risk of all cancer and specific cancers were examined in a prospective cohort study of 18,244 Chinese men enrolled in 1986. During the 25 years of follow-up, 3,973 men developed cancer including 964 lung cancers, 624 colorectal cancers, 560 gastric cancers, 353 liver cancers, and 172 urinary bladder cancers. Hazard ratios (HR) for all cancer and specific cancers by ABO blood type were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. Compared with blood type A, blood type B was associated with statistically significant reduced risk of all cancers (HR, 0.91, 95% CI:0.84, 0.99). Both blood types B and AB were associated with significantly lower risk of gastrointestinal cancer and colorectal cancer, respectively. Blood type B was also associated with significantly lower risk of stomach cancer and bladder cancer, while blood type AB was associated with significantly increased risk of liver cancer. By histological type, blood types B and AB were associated with lower risk of epidermoid carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, but were not associated with risk of sarcoma, lymphoma, leukemia or other cell types of cancer. The findings of this study support a role of genetic traits related to ABO blood type in the development of cancers in the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts.
UGT2B15 (uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15) catalyzes the conversion of lipophilic C19 steroid androgens such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) into water-soluble metabolites that can be excreted. Studies of the association between the 
NQO1 is one of the two major quinone reductases in mammalian systems. It is highly inducible and plays multiple roles in cellular adaptation to stress. A prevalent polymorphic form of NQO1 results in an absence of NQO1 protein and activity so it is important to elucidate the specific cellular functions of NQO1. Established roles of NQO1 include its ability to prevent certain quinones from one electron redox cycling but its role in quinone detoxification is dependent on the redox stability of the hydroquinone generated by two-electron reduction. Other documented roles of NQO1 include its ability to function as a component of the plasma membrane redox system generating antioxidant forms of ubiquinone and vitamin E and at high levels, as a direct superoxide reductase. Emerging roles of NQO1 include its function as an efficient intracellular generator of NAD
GNE myopathy is a rare neuromuscular genetic disorder characterized by early adult onset and muscle weakness due to mutation in sialic acid biosynthetic enzyme, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE). More than 180 different GNE mutations are known all over the world with unclear pathomechanism. Although hyposialylation of glycoproteins is speculated to be the major cause, but cellular mechanism leading to loss of muscle mass has not yet been deciphered. Besides sialic acid biosynthesis, GNE affects other cellular functions such as cell adhesion and apoptosis. In order to understand the effect of mutant GNE protein on cellular functions, differential proteome profile of HEK293 cells overexpressing pathologically relevant recombinant mutant GNE protein (D207V and V603L) was analyzed. These cells, along with vector control and wild-type GNE-overexpressing cells, were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS). In the study, 10 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Progenesis same spots software revealed downregulation of peroxiredoxin IV (PrdxIV), an ER-resident H
AKR1C3 is a drug target in hormonal and hormonal independent malignancies and acts as a major peripheral 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to yield the potent androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, and as a prostaglandin (PG) F synthase to produce proliferative ligands for the PG FP receptor. AKR1C3 inhibitors may have distinct advantages over existing therapeutics for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer, breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. Area covered: This article reviews the patent literature on AKR1C3 inhibitors using SciFinder which identified inhibitors in the following chemical classes: N-phenylsulfonyl-indoles, N-(benzimidazoylylcarbonyl)- N-(indoylylcarbonyl)- and N-(pyridinepyrrolyl)- piperidines, N-benzimidazoles and N-benzindoles, repurposed nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (indole acetic acids, N-phenylanthranilates and aryl propionic acids), isoquinolines, and nitrogen and sulfur substituted estrenes. The article evaluates inhibitor AKR potency, specificity, efficacy in cell-based and xenograft models and clinical utility. The advantage of bifunctional compounds that either competitively inhibit AKR1C3 and block its androgen receptor (AR) coactivator function or act as AKR1C3 inhibitors and direct acting AR antagonists are discussed. Expert opinion: A large number of potent and selective inhibitors of AKR1C3 have been described however, preclinical optimization, is required before their benefit in human disease can be assessed.
ABCB1 polymorphisms are known to modify drug pharmacokinetics but have yet to be studied for their role in generating and maintaining cannabis dependence. The objective of this study is to determine if ABCB1 C3435T (rs1045642) polymorphism may modulate Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) blood levels in a sample of heavy cannabis users. The study sample includes 39 Caucasian individuals, recruited in two French addictology centres, with isolated cannabis dependence and heavy use (defined as ≥ 7 joints per week). Each underwent clinical evaluation, cannabis blood metabolite dosage (THC, 11-OH-THC, and THC-COOH) and genotyping of ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism. In this population (males: 74.4%, average age 29.5 +/- 9), average cannabis use was 21 joints per week (median 12; range 7 - 80). T carriers (TT/CT) had significantly lower plasma THC levels (ng/ml) versus non T carriers (8 vs 15.70, significant), controlling for level of weekly use, 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH levels. Our results show that ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism may modulate serum THC levels in chronic heavy cannabis users. The exact mechanisms and roles that this may play in cannabis dependence genesis and evolution remain to be elucidated. These results should be controlled in a replication study using a larger population.
CD36 (also known as scavenger receptor B2) is a multifunctional receptor that mediates the binding and cellular uptake of long-chain fatty acids, oxidized lipids and phospholipids, advanced oxidation protein products, thrombospondin and advanced glycation end products, and has roles in lipid accumulation, inflammatory signalling, energy reprogramming, apoptosis and kidney fibrosis. Renal CD36 is mainly expressed in tubular epithelial cells, podocytes and mesangial cells, and is markedly upregulated in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD). As fatty acids are the preferred energy source for proximal tubule cells, a reduction in fatty acid oxidation in CKD affects kidney lipid metabolism by disrupting the balance between fatty acid synthesis, uptake and consumption. The outcome is intracellular lipid accumulation, which has an important role in the pathogenesis of kidney fibrosis. In experimental models, antagonist blockade or genetic knockout of CD36 prevents kidney injury, suggesting that CD36 could be a novel target for therapy. Here, we discuss the regulation and post-translational modification of CD36, its role in renal pathophysiology and its potential as a biomarker and as a therapeutic target for the prevention of kidney fibrosis.
TK1 is an enzyme involved in DNA synthesis and repair. TK1 is usually found elevated in cancer patients' serum, which makes it a useful tumor proliferation biomarker that strongly correlates with cancer stage, metastatic capabilities, and recurrence risk. In this study, we show that TK1 is upregulated and localizes on the plasma membrane of Burkitt's lymphoma, acute promyelocytic leukemia, T cell leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that TK1 localizes on the surface of Raji, HL60, and Jurkat cell lines and on ALL clinical samples. Using fluorescent microscopy, we found a strong association of TK1 with the plasma membrane in Raji, HL60, and Jurkat cell lines. These findings were also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Our study also shows that this phenomenon does not occur on normal resting or proliferating lymphocytes. In addition, we show that membrane TK1 is found in all oligomeric forms ranging from monomer to tetramer and exhibits enzymatic activity. These findings suggest TK1 as a possible target for immunotherapy with the potential to be utilized in the treatment of hematological cancers.
IDH1 R132H mutation is an important marker of survival in patients with gliomas. Although there are many changes of genes in tumour malignant progression, IDH1 R132H mutation status in glioma progression remained unclear. Here, an in-depth characterization of IDH1 R132H mutations were assessed by immunohistochemistry in 55 paired primary-recurrent astrocytomas tissues, including 5 paired primary pilocytic astrocytoma (pPA, WHO grade I), 35 paired primary low grade astrocytoma (pLGA, WHO grade II and III) and 15 paired primary high grade astrocytoma (pHGA/ Glioblastoma, WHO grade IV). Meanwhile, the DNA was isolated from paired samples, and PCR amplification was used for IDH1 exon4 sequencing. Nonparametric test, KM and Cox models were used to examine the statistical difference and survival function. We found that the percent of IDH1 R132H mutation was 68.6% (24/35) in pLGA group, but no IDH1 mutation was found in pPA and pHGA groups. Meanwhile, the results from immunohistochemistry and DNA sequencing showed that, compared with primary astrocytoma, there was no change of IDH1 status in recurrent astrocytoma whatever tumour pathological grade raise or indolent. The pPA group has the longest recurrence-free period (RFP) and overall survival (OS) in three groups (
NQO1 and TRXR1 are important host reductases implicated in the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis. Although the transcriptional machinery governing these processes have been extensively investigated, the associated epigenetic regulatory events remain unclear. Here, we report that SET8, a histone H4 lysine 20 monomethylase (H4K20me1), is highly induced during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection that orchestrates immune evasion strategies through the induction of NQO1 and TRXR1 in vivo. SET8, along with FoxO3a, mediates an active NQO1-PGC1-α complex, which promotes the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage phenotype, and assists TRXR1-regulated arrest of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis. Strikingly, the loss-of-function analysis in an in vivo mouse tuberculosis model further corroborated the pivotal role of SET8-responsive NQO1 and TRXR1 in mycobacterial survival. Thus, augmenting host immune responses against Mycobacterium tuberculosis by harnessing the SET8-NQO1/TRXR1 axis with its specific and potent inhibitors could lead to promising host-directed therapeutic adjuvants for tuberculosis treatment.
ABO antigens are highly abundant in many human cell types, including platelets, vascular endothelium, and red blood cells. The presence of a thrombus is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We reviewed the relationship between ABO blood groups and thrombus burden in patients with STEMI.
PIK3CA alterations have been shown to be a frequent event in oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (SCC), especially in human papillomavirus (HPV)-related tumors.
OTC drugs have an important role in self-medication. However, the pharmacokinetic properties of some OTC drugs have not been fully investigated and reports concerning their drug interactions are insufficient. Several gastrointestinal drugs are available as OTC drugs. Because of their pharmacological properties, these drugs are often used concomitantly with other drugs. Therefore, it is important to predict the possible drug interactions among these drugs. In the current study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of five gastrointestinal drugs, namely loperamide, oxethazaine, papaverine, pirenzepine, and trimebutine, on CYP activities in human liver microsomes. Furthermore, we calculated the ratio of the intrinsic clearance of each CYP substrate in the presence or absence of the gastrointestinal drugs. The possibility of drug interactions in vivo was predicted by cut-off criteria. CYP3A4 activity was markedly inhibited by trimebutine, papaverine, and oxethazaine. Their inhibitory properties were competitive and the K
"OTC drugs play an important role in self-medication. OTC analgesic and antipyretic drugs are widely used in Japan. The present study aimed to survey the components of OTC drug package inserts for analgesic and antipyretic drugs and to evaluate the adverse event profiles using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database (JADER). The JADER contains 430587 reports from between April 2004 and November 2016; a total of 750 reports of adverse events resulted from the use of OTC analgesic and antipyretic drugs. The safety signals were detected by the reporting odds ratio (ROR). The ROR values for ""Skin & subcutaneous tissue disorders"", ""Immune system disorders"", and ""Hepatobiliary disorders"" stratified by system organ class of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) were 7.58 (6.56-8.76), 4.25 (3.51-5.14), and 2.35 (1.93-2.85), respectively. OTC analgesic and antipyretic drugs containing allylisopropylacetylurea (AIAU) exhibited a significantly high reporting ratio of ""Skin & subcutaneous tissue disorders"" compared with the drugs without AIAU. No difference in the reported incidence of ""Hepatobiliary disorders"" was found between the drugs with or without acetaminophen. Our results suggested that it was important to monitor patients who use OTC analgesic and antipyretic drug containing AIAU; in particular, careful attention should be paid to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders."
ATP6V1H encodes the subunit H of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) and has been recently proved to regulate osteoclast function. The alternative splicing of ATP6V1H gene results in two isoforms, and it is not clear whether and how the two isoforms function differently. In this report, we used bioinformatics methods to compare the differences of two isoforms in different species. The distributions and amounts of two isoforms were analyzed in eleven kinds of mouse tissues and mouse osteoclasts using RT-PCR, Q-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemical staining methods, respectively. In order to observe the in vivo biological differences of two isoforms during development, the zebrafish mRNA of two wild type atp6v1h transcripts as well as their mutant forms were also injected into zebrafish embryos, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that two isoforms were quite different in many ways, especially in protein size, internal space, phosphorylation state and H-bond binding. The amounts of two transcripts and the ratio of long and short transcript varied a lot from tissue to tissue or cell to cell, and osteoclasts were the cells only expressing long isoform among the tissues or cells we detected. The in vivo selective expression of two subunit H splice variants showed their different effects on the craniofacial development of zebrafish. The short isoform reduced the size of zebrafish head and did not play a complete function compared with the long isoform. We propose that long isoform of subunit H is necessary for the normal craniofacial bone development and the lack of short transcript might be necessary for the normal osteoclastic function.
WWOX (WW domain-containing oxidoreductase) is known to be an important tumor suppressor in cancer. In this study, we used samples from 201 osteosarcoma patients to investigate the effects of WWOX on angiogenesis and invasion. WWOX levels were negatively correlated with RUNX2 and VEGF levels, but were not correlated with OPN levels. Among the clinicopathological characteristics examined, WWOX was associated only with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and its expression in osteosarcoma tissues was a predictor of disease-free survival. WWOX promoted apoptosis and inhibited invasion and expression of bcl-2, OPN, RUNX2, and VEGF in osteosarcoma cells 
ACE I/D and MTHFR C677T gene polymorphisms can be seen as candidate genes for glioma on the basis of their biological functions and their involvement in different cancers. The aim of this study was to analyze potential association and overall survival between MTHFR C677T and ACE I/D polymorphism in glioma patients in our population.
"CYP4Z1 is an ""orphan"" cytochrome P450 (P450) enzyme that has provoked interest because of its hypothesized role in breast cancer through formation of the signaling molecule 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE). We expressed human CYP4Z1 in "
CD36 is a multiligand receptor involved in lipid metabolism. We investigated the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effect of CP-3(iv), an azapeptide belonging to a new class of selective CD36 ligands. The role of CP-3(iv) in mediating cardioprotection was investigated because CD36 signaling leads to activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, a transcriptional regulator of adiponectin. CP-3(iv) pretreatment reduced infarct size by 54% and preserved hemodynamics in C57BL/6 mice subjected to 30 min coronary ligation and reperfusion but had no effect in CD36-deficient mice. The effects of CP-3(iv) were associated with an increase in circulating adiponectin levels, epididymal fat adiponectin gene expression, and adiponectin transcriptional regulators ( Pparg, Cebpb, Sirt1) after 6 h of reperfusion. Reduced myocardial oxidative stress and apoptosis were observed along with an increase in expression of myocardial adiponectin target proteins, including cyclooxygenase-2, phospho-AMPK, and phospho-Akt. Moreover, CP-3(iv) increased myocardial performance in isolated hearts, whereas blockade of adiponectin with an anti-adiponectin antibody abrogated it. CP-3(iv) exerts cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (MI/R) injury and dysfunction, at least in part, by increasing circulating and myocardial adiponectin levels. Hence, both paracrine and endocrine effects of adiponectin may contribute to reduced reactive oxygen species generation and apoptosis after MI/R, in a CD36-dependent manner.-Huynh, D. N., Bessi, V. L., Ménard, L., Piquereau, J., Proulx, C., Febbraio, M., Lubell, W. D., Carpentier, A. C., Burelle, Y., Ong, H., Marleau, S. Adiponectin has a pivotal role in the cardioprotective effect of CP-3(iv), a selective CD36 azapeptide ligand, after transient coronary artery occlusion in mice.
PC are a main cause of death following HSCT in children. We aimed to evaluate early predictors of mortality in paediatric recipients with PCs. A retrospective observational study of 35 patients with 49 episodes of PI on chest radiography (of 124 patients) who had undergone HSCT at a tertiary university hospital between January 2011 and December 2012 was performed. During follow-up (median 26.1 months), 15 episodes led to death (30.6%). An aetiologic diagnosis was made by non-invasive tests in 24 episodes (49.0%) and by adding bronchoalveolar lavage and/or lung biopsy in 7 episodes with diagnostic yield (77.8%, P = .001). Thus, a specific diagnosis was obtained in 63.3% of the episodes. Aetiology identification and treatment modification after diagnosis did not decrease mortality (P = .057, P = .481). However, the number of organ dysfunctions at the beginning of PI was higher in the mortality group, compared to the survivor group (1.7 ± 1.2 vs 0.32 ± 0.59; P = .001). Hepatic dysfunction (OR, 11.145; 95% CI, 1.23 to 101.29; P = .032) and neutropaenia (OR, 10.558; 95% CI, 1.07 to 104.65; P = .044) were independently associated with risk of mortality. Therefore, hepatic dysfunction and neutropaenia are independent early predictors of mortality in HSCT recipients with PCs.
CYP2C19 is known to be the main enzyme of biotransformation of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), whereas the

ATP2B1 is a gene associated with hypertension. We reported previously that mice lacking ATP2B1 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC ATP2B1 KO mice) exhibited high blood pressure and increased intracellular calcium concentration. The present study was designed to investigate whether lack of the ATP2B1 gene causes a higher response to calcium channel blockers (CCBs) than to other types of anti-hypertensive drugs. Both VSMC ATP2B1 KO and control mice were administered anti-hypertensive drugs while monitoring blood pressure shifts. We also examined the association of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in those mice to investigate whether another mechanism of hypertension existed. VSMC ATP2B1 KO mice exhibited significantly greater anti-hypertensive effects with a single injection of nicardipine, but the effects of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), an α-blocker and amlodipine on blood pressure were all similar to control mice. However, long-term treatment with amlodipine, but not an ARB, significantly decreased the blood pressure of KO mice compared with control mice. Both mRNA and protein expression levels of the L-type calcium channel were significantly upregulated in KO VSMCs. There were no alterations in neural NOS protein expression of VSMCs or in urinary NO production between the two groups. VSMC ATP2B1 KO mice had a higher response to CCBs for blood pressure-lowering effects than other anti-hypertensive drugs. These results mean that increased intracellular calcium concentration in VSMCs due to lack of ATP2B1 and subsequent activation of L-type calcium channels mainly affects blood pressure and suggests increased susceptibility to CCBs in this type of hypertension.
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog gene on chromosome 10), a well-characterized tumor suppressor, is a key regulator of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway involved in cell survival, metastasis and cell renewal. PTEN expression is closely related to the phenotype, prognosis and drug selection in breast cancer. It is mainly regulated by transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications. RNA binding motif protein 38 (RBM38), an RNA-binding protein (RBP) and a target of P53 family, plays a crucial role in the regulation of cellular processing, especially in post-transcription regulation and gene transcription. In this study, we investigated a new post-transcription regulation mechanism of PTEN expression by RBM38 in breast cancer.
CLYBL encodes a ubiquitously expressed mitochondrial enzyme, conserved across all vertebrates, whose cellular activity and pathway assignment are unknown. Its homozygous loss is tolerated in seemingly healthy individuals, with reduced circulating B
CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) neurons are cultured in two-chamber devices on multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) and connected via micro-tunnels. In order to evoke time-locked activity, paired-pulse stimulation is applied to 22 different sites and repeated 25 times in each well in 5 MEA co-cultures and results compared to CA3-CA3 and DG-DG networks homologous controls. In these hippocampal sub-regions, we focus on the mechanisms underpinning a network's ability to decode the identity of site specific stimulation from analysis of evoked network responses using a support vector machine classifier. Our results indicate that a pool of CA3 neurons is able to reliably decode the identity of DG stimulation site information.
SLC1A3 encodes the glial glutamate transporter hEAAT1, which removes glutamate from the synaptic cleft via stoichiometrically coupled Na
CA1 place cells become more anticipatory with experience, an effect thought to be caused by NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity in the CA3-CA1 network. Theta (~5-12 Hz), slow gamma (~25-50 Hz), and fast gamma (~50-100 Hz) rhythms are thought to route spatial information in the hippocampal formation and to coordinate place cell ensembles. Yet, it is unknown whether these rhythms exhibit experience-dependent changes concurrent with those observed in place cells. Slow gamma rhythms are thought to indicate inputs from CA3 to CA1, and such inputs are thought to be strengthened with experience. Thus, we hypothesized that slow gamma rhythms would become more evident with experience. We tested this hypothesis using mice freely traversing a familiar circular track for three 10-min sessions per day. We found that slow gamma amplitude was reduced in the early minutes of the first session of each day, even though both theta and fast gamma amplitudes were elevated during this same period. However, in the first minutes of the second and third sessions of each day, all three rhythms were elevated. Interestingly, theta was elevated to a greater degree in the first minutes of the first session than in the first minutes of later sessions. Additionally, all three rhythms were strongly influenced by running speed in dynamic ways, with the influence of running speed on theta and slow gamma changing over time within and across sessions. These results raise the possibility that experience-dependent changes in hippocampal rhythms relate to changes in place cell activity that emerge with experience. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We show that CA1 theta, slow gamma, and fast gamma rhythms exhibit characteristic changes over time within sessions in familiar environments. These effects in familiar environments evolve across repeated sessions.
SDS is commonly employed as BGE additive in CZE analysis of non-enveloped icosahedral viruses. But the way by which SDS interacts with the surface of such viruses remains to date poorly known, making complicate to understand their behavior during a run. In this article, two related bacteriophages, MS2 and Qβ, are used as model to investigate the migration mechanism of non-enveloped icosahedral viruses in SDS-based CZE. Both phages are characterized by similar size and surface charge but significantly different surface hydrophobicity (Qβ > MS2, where '>' means 'more hydrophobic than'). By comparing their electrophoretic mobility in the presence or not of SDS on both sides of the CMC, we show that surface hydrophobicity of phages is a key factor influencing their mobility and that SDS-virus association is driven by hydrophobic interactions at the surface of virions. The CZE analyses of heated MS2 particles, which over-express hydrophobic domains at their surface, confirm this finding. The correlations between the present results and others from the literature suggest that the proposed mechanism might not be exclusive to the bacteriophages examined here.
CYP2D6 is a critical pharmacogenetic target, and polymorphisms in the gene region are commonly used to infer enzyme activity score and predict resulting metabolizer phenotype: poor, intermediate, extensive/normal, or ultrarapid which can be useful in determining cause and/or manner of death in some autopsies. Current genotyping approaches are incapable of identifying novel and/or rare variants, so CYP2D6 star allele definitions are limited to polymorphisms known a priori. While useful for most predictions, recent studies using massively parallel sequencing data have identified additional polymorphisms in CYP2D6 that are predicted to alter enzyme function but are not considered in current star allele nomenclature. The 1000 Genomes Project data were used to produce full-gene haplotypes, describe their distribution in super-populations, and predict enzyme activity scores. Full-gene haplotypes generated lower activity scores than current approaches due to inclusion of additional damaging polymorphisms in the star allele. These findings are critical for clinical implementation of metabolizer phenotype prediction because a fraction of the population may be incorrectly considered normal metabolizers but actually may be poor or intermediate metabolizers.
ABO blood group antigens have been reported to be associated with inflammation and infections which have been largely implicated in the onset and progression of immune-mediated diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the association between ABO blood group and progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). We retrospectively enrolled 919 biopsy-proven IgAN patients with a minimum follow-up of 1 year and eGFR≥15ml/min/1.73m

ABO incompatible (ABOi) organ transplantation requires pre-transplant reduction of the recipient's IgG and IgM isoagglutinin titer against the donor to prevent hyperacute rejection. Over the past four years we primarily used unspecific IgG immunoadsorption (IA) for this purpose and combined this selectively with membrane filtration (IAc) to reduce IgM isoagglutinines. In patients with an initial IgG titer against donor below 1:64, plasma exchange (PE) was initiated. In this retrospective analysis covering January 2012 to August 2015 we compared how efficiently IgG and IgM isoagglutinines in a total of 22 ABOi kidney transplant recipients were reduced by either IA (n = 75 sessions), IAc (n = 14 sessions) or PE (n = 40 sessions). Median pre-treatment IgG isoagglutinin titers were 32 (4-4096) while IgM titers were 16 (1-256) respectively. Mean IgG reduction by either treatment modality was 1.3 ± 0.9 (IA), 1.8 ± 1.0 (IAc) and 2.6 ± 1.3 (PE) titer steps per session (p < 0.001 IA vs. PE; p < 0.04 PE vs. IAc). Mean IgM reduction was 0.6 ± 0.6 (IA), 1.8 ± 0.8 (IAc) and 2.4 ± 1.9 (PE) titer steps (p < 0.001 for both IA vs. PE and IA vs. IAc). Our data indicate that PE efficiently removed IgG- and IgM isoagglutinines. By processing only half the plasma volume per treatment PE was twice as effective as IA in terms of IgG-type isoagglutinin removal in our patient group. This is best explained by the presence of soluble AB0 antigens in the FFP used as plasma replacement. These advantages in efficacy have to be weighed against the potential hazards of PE. Combination of IA and plasma filtration effectively removes IgM-type and even enhances net IgG-type isoagglutinin elimination compared to IA alone. When trying to avoid PE, combined application of IA and IAc is a possible and effective way to reduce isoagglutinin titers before ABOi transplantation.
HADH is a key enzyme in fatty acid oxidation. The aim of this study was to identify the role of HADH in gastric cancer. We analyzed the expression of HADH in 102 pairs of gastric cancer samples. Western blot analysis revealed that HADH was decreased in stage I/II gastric cancer samples compared to matched adjacent normal gastric tissue, and its expression was further decreased in stage III/IV samples. Importantly, the reduced expression of HADH was associated with increased expression of p-Akt and reduced expression of PTEN in the gastric carcinoma tumor samples. To determine the significance of HADH downregulation in gastric cancer progression, we tested the impact of HADH knockdown or overexpression on the migration and invasion of the gastric cancer cells using a transwell assay. Knockdown of HADH significantly promoted gastric cancer cell migration and invasion, which was associated with increased expression of p-Akt. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibited HADH shRNA induced migration/invasion, and abolished the upregulation of p-Akt. By contrast, HADH overexpression inhibited the migration and invasion of MKN45 cells. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate that downregulation of HADH promotes gastric cancer progression via activation of Akt signaling pathway.
ABO genotyping is used in several disciplines, including transfusion, transplantation, human evolution, and forensic medicine. Detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a locus is a common way to identify different genotypes. In this study we developed a strategy for ABO genotyping, which can rapidly and efficiently detect SNPs. DNA fragments containing 4 SNPs in the ABO gene (c.261delG, c.297A > G, c.1009A > G, and c.1061delC) were amplified using individually and multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods and subsequently genotyped by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. Human blood ABO genotypes from 92 samples were successfully determined by HRM analysis. A total of 14 genotypes (A/A, A/O01, A/O02, A201/O01, A205/O01, B/B, B/O01, B/O02, A/B, A201/B, A205/B, O01/O01, O02/O02, O01/O02) were identified by analysis of the 4 SNPs of interest in this study. The results suggest that the present HRM assay is a reliable and rapid method for ABO blood type genotyping and it may offer an alternative to traditional genotyping methods.
PTEN phosphorylation at its C-terminal (C-tail) serine/threonine cluster negatively regulates its tumor suppressor function. However, the consequence of such inhibition and its downstream effects in driving lung cancer remain unexplored. Herein, we ascertain the molecular mechanisms by which phosphorylation compromises PTEN function, contributing to lung cancer. Replacement of the serine/threonine residues with alanine generated PTEN-4A, a phosphorylation-deficient PTEN mutant, which suppressed lung cancer cell proliferation and migration. PTEN-4A preferentially localized to the nucleus where it suppressed E2F1-mediated transcription of cell cycle genes. PTEN-4A physically interacted with the transcription factor E2F1 and associated with chromatin at gene promoters with E2F1 DNA-binding sites, a likely mechanism for its transcriptional suppression function. Deletion analysis revealed that the C2 domain of PTEN was indispensable for suppression of E2F1-mediated transcription. Further, we uncovered cancer-associated C2 domain mutant proteins that had lost their ability to suppress E2F1-mediated transcription, supporting the concept that these mutations are oncogenic in patients. Consistent with these findings, we observed increased PTEN phosphorylation and reduced nuclear PTEN levels in lung cancer patient samples establishing phosphorylation as a bona fide inactivation mechanism for PTEN in lung cancer. Thus, use of small molecule inhibitors that hinder PTEN phosphorylation is a plausible approach to activate PTEN function in the treatment of lung cancer.

CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on multiple myeloma (MM) cells, and at relatively low levels on normal lymphoid and myeloid cells, and in some tissues of nonhematopoietic origin. CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein with ectoenzymatic activity, and also functions as a receptor and adhesion molecule. Altogether, this has triggered the development of several CD38 antibodies including daratumumab (fully human), isatuximab (chimeric), and MOR202 (fully human). CD38 antibodies have pleiotropic mechanisms of action including Fc-dependent immune-effector mechanisms, direct apoptotic activity, and immunomodulatory effects by the elimination of CD38
PGD for HLA typing is a procedure that can be performed when an affected child requires a transplant to treat a non-hereditary disorder related to the hematopoietic and/or immune system. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA-identical donor provides the best treatment option. Three conventional ovarian stimulation procedures for IVF were performed in a couple with a 10-year-old child diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia of high risk. Trophectoderm biopsy and aCGH examination were performed on 15 blastocysts, three on the first IVF procedure, four on the second cycle, and eight on the third. Three euploid blastocysts HLA-compatible with the genome of the affected child were identified. One euploid blastocyst HLA-compatible with the affected child was warmed and transferred, resulting in an HLA-matched live birth. In conclusion, combined aCGH for aneuploidy screening and Karyomapping may be performed in a single biopsy procedure.
FUT1 is a key rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of Lewis y, a membrane-associated carbohydrate antigen. The aberrant upregulation of FUT1 and Lewis y antigen is related to proliferation, invasion and prognosis in malignant epithelial tumors. A c-Fos/activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding site was found in the FUT1 promoter. However, the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of FUT1 remain poorly understood. TGF-β1 is positively correlated to Lewis y. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of FUT1 gene expression in response to TGF-β1. We demonstrated that c-Fos was highly expressed in 77.50% of ovarian epithelial carcinoma cases and was significantly correlated with Lewis y. Using luciferase activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we further revealed that c-Fos interacted with the FUT1 promoter in ovarian cancer cells and transcriptional capacity of the heterodimer formed by c-Fos and c-Jun was stronger than that of the c-Fos or c-Jun homodimers. Then, we demonstrated that TGF-β1 induced dose-dependent c-Fos expression, which was involved in TGF-β1-induced ovarian cancer cell proliferation. In addition, inhibition of MAPK activation or TGF-β1 receptor by pharmacological agents prevented TGF-β1-induced c-Fos and Lewis y expression. Silencing of c-Fos prevented TGF-β1-induced Lewis y expression. Collectively, the results of these studies demonstrated that TGF-β1 regulated FUT1 and Lewis y expression by activating the MAPK/c-Fos pathway.
PDE10A encodes a dual cAMP-cGMP phosphodiesterase that is enriched in the medium spiny neurons of the corpus striatum in the brain and plays an important role in basal ganglia circuitry. Three unrelated patients with childhood onset chorea and striatal abnormalities on MRI brain with heterozygous de novo variants in PDE10A have been described previously. Two families with eight affected individuals with biallelic mutations in PDE10A have also been described previously. We report a family with multiple affected individuals with childhood onset chorea, striatal abnormalities, and a novel heterozygous mutation, c.1001T>G(p.F334C) in PDE10A which was identified by exome sequencing.

GNE myopathy, a rare, severe, progressive myopathy, presents with lower extremity distal muscle weakness. The GNE myopathy functional activity scale (GNEM-FAS) evaluates the impact of GNE myopathy on functioning in adults. This paper presents the psychometric validation of the GNEM-FAS.
PTEN activity is often lost in prostate cancer. We show that the tyrosine kinase PTK6 (BRK) is a PTEN substrate. Phosphorylation of PTK6 tyrosine 342 (PY342) promotes activation, while phosphorylation of tyrosine 447 (PY447) regulates auto-inhibition. Introduction of PTEN into a PTEN null prostate cancer cell line leads to dephosphorylation of PY342 but not PY447 and PTK6 inhibition. Conversely, PTEN knockdown promotes PTK6 activation in PTEN positive cells. Using a variety of PTEN mutant constructs, we show that protein phosphatase activity of PTEN targets PTK6, with efficiency similar to PTP1B, a phosphatase that directly dephosphorylates PTK6 Y342. Conditional disruption of Pten in the mouse prostate leads to tumorigenesis and increased phosphorylation of PTK6 Y342, and disruption of Ptk6 impairs tumorigenesis. In human prostate tumor tissue microarrays, loss of PTEN correlates with increased PTK6 PY342 and poor outcome. These data suggest PTK6 activation promotes invasive prostate cancer induced by PTEN loss.
AQP2 expression is mainly controlled by vasopressin-dependent changes in protein abundance which is in turn regulated by AQP2 ubiquitylation and degradation, however the proteins involved in these processes are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the potential role of the CHIP E3 ligase in AQP2 regulation.
ABCA4 is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins that transports N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine (N-Ret-PE) across outer segment disc membranes thereby facilitating the removal of potentially toxic retinoid compounds from photoreceptor cells. Mutations in the gene encoding ABCA4 are responsible for Stargardt disease (STGD1), an autosomal recessive retinal degenerative disease that causes severe vision loss. To define the molecular basis for STGD1 associated with the p.Asn965Ser (N965S) mutation in the Walker A motif of nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1), we generated a p.Asn965Ser knockin mouse and compared the subcellular localization and molecular properties of the disease variant with wild-type (WT) ABCA4. Here, we show that the p.Asn965Ser ABCA4 variant expresses at half the level of WT ABCA4, partially mislocalizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of photoreceptors, is devoid of N-Ret-PE activated ATPase activity, and causes an increase in autofluorescence and the bisretinoid A2E associated with lipofuscin deposits in retinal pigment epithelial cells as found in Stargardt patients and Abca4 knockout mice. We also show for the first time that a significant fraction of WT ABCA4 is retained in the inner segment of photoreceptors. On the basis of these studies we conclude that loss in substrate-dependent ATPase activity and protein misfolding are mechanisms underlying STGD1 associated with the p.Asn965Ser mutation in ABCA4. Functional and molecular modeling studies further suggest that similar pathogenic mechanisms are responsible for Tangiers disease associated with the p.Asn935Ser (N935S) mutation in the NBD1 Walker A motif of ABCA1.
ABO blood groups are genetically transmitted through chromosome 9 at locus 9q34. It is supposed that there is a locus on 9p21, which has a role in developing coronary artery disease.
PTEN inactivation occurs commonly in human cancers and putatively activates the PI3K/AKT/ mTOR pathway. Activation of this pathway has been involved in resistance to chemotherapy or anti-EGFR/HER2 therapies. We evaluated the combination of PI3K-mTOR inhibitors with chemotherapy or the pan-HER inhibitor dacomitinib in PTEN-deficient patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX). Three PDXs were selected for their lack of PTEN expression by immunohistochemistry: a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a 
SETDB1 is a novel histone methyltransferase associated with the functional tri-methylation of histone H3K9. Although aberrant high expression of SETDB1 was experimentally obversed in a variety of solid tumors, its underlying mechanisms in human carcinogenesis are not well known. In this study, we investigated the expression of SETDB1 in a large cohort of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples and cell lines for the first time. Our findings showed that SETDB1 was highly expressed in majority CRC tissues and cell lines; moreover, up-regulation of SETDB1 was negatively correlated with the survival rate of CRC patients. Functionally, over-expression of SETDB1 significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of CRC cells 
MPI can provide valuable information in the investigation of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. The stress component of the studies can be conducted with regadenoson, which was approved for clinical use in Greece in 2016. We investigated the performance and safety profile of regadenoson MPI based on our 7 months institutional experience.
HSD17B1 is a steroid metabolising enzyme. We have previously generated knockout mice that had the entire coding region of Hsd17b1 replaced with lacZ-neo cassette (Hsd17b1-LacZ/Neo mice). This resulted in a 90% reduction of HSD17B1 activity, associated with severe subfertility in the knockout females. The present study indicates that Hsd17b1-LacZ/Neo male mice have a metabolic phenotype, including reduced adipose mass, increased lean mass and lipid accumulation in the liver. During the characterisation of this metabolic phenotype, it became evident that the expression of the Naglu gene, located closely upstream of Hsd17b1, was severely reduced in all tissues analysed. Similar results were obtained from Hsd17b1-LacZ mice after removing the neo cassette from the locus or by crossing the Hsd17b1-LacZ/Neo mice with transgenic mice constitutively expressing human HSD17B1. The deficiency of Naglu caused the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in all studied mouse models lacking the Hsd17b1 gene. The metabolic phenotypes of the Hsd17b1 knockout mouse models were recapitulated in Naglu knockout mice. Based on the data we propose that the Hsd17b1 gene includes a regulatory element controlling Naglu expression and the metabolic phenotype in mice lacking the Hsd17b1 genomic region is caused by the reduced expression of Naglu rather than the lack of Hsd17b1.
FLVCR1 (feline leukemia virus subgroup c receptor 1) is a transmembrane protein involved in the trafficking of intracellular heme. Homozygous variants in FLVCR1 have been described in association with a clinical syndrome of posterior column ataxia with retinitis pigmentosa (PCARP). Here, we describe a patient with non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa homozygous for a splice-site variant in FLVCR1 (c.1092 + 5G>A) without evidence of posterior column ataxia or cerebellar degeneration. We suggest an association between intronic splice-site variants in FLVCR1 and the absence of posterior column degeneration and suggest a hypothesis to explain this observation. Should this association be proven, it would provide valuable prognostic information for patients. Retinal degeneration appears to be the sole clinical manifestation of this FLVCR1 variant; gene therapy approaches using an adeno-associated viral vector with sub-retinal delivery may therefore represent a therapeutic approach to halting retinal degeneration in this patient group.
ABO and Rh blood groups play a vital role in blood transfusion safety and clinical practice and are thought to be linked with disease susceptibility. The results from previous studies that focused on the association between blood groups and HBV infection remain controversial. China has the world's largest burden of HBV infection. We assessed the distribution of ABO/Rh blood groups in Chinese adults and examined the association between these groups and HBV infection. We did a nationwide cross-sectional study using data from a physical check-up programme from 31 provinces examined between 2010 and 2012. ELISA was used to test for HBsAg in serologic samples. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate aOR of the association between ABO and Rh blood groups and HBV infection. Among 3 827 125 participants, the proportion of participants with blood group A was highest (30.54%), followed by O (30.37%), B (29.42%) and AB (9.66%). A total of 38 907 (1.02%) were Rh-D negative. The prevalence of HBsAg in blood groups O, A, B and AB were 6.34%, 5.55%, 5.18% and 5.06%, respectively. HBsAg prevalence was 5.65% in Rh-D-positive and 3.96% in Rh-D-negative participants. After controlling for other potential risk factors, multivariate models showed that participants with blood group O (adjusted OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.20-1.25) were at higher risk of HBV infection compared with group AB. Rh-D-positive participants (adjusted OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.37-1.52) were at higher risk of HBV infection than Rh-D-negative participants. The associations between ABO/Rh blood groups and HBV infection were similar in subgroup analysis. The proportions of O, A, B and AB blood groups were approximately 3:3:3:1, and nearly 1 in 100 people was Rh-D negative among Chinese adults. Blood group O and Rh-D positivity were both associated with increased HBV infection. The risk of HBV infection and blood safety should be taken into consideration in clinical practice, especially when transfusing those with blood group O. Awareness and prevention of HBV infection is of particular importance for individuals with blood group O.
ABO and RhD blood groups are key factors affecting blood transfusion safety. The distribution of ABO and RhD blood groups varies globally, but limited data exist for ethnic distributions of these blood groups in Asian populations. We aimed to evaluate the distribution of ABO and RhD blood groups among Chinese ethnic groups.
SETD7 is a methyltransferase that specifically catalyzes the monomethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3. A variety of studies has revealed the role of SETD7 in posttranslational modifications of non-histone proteins. However, the prognostic value of SETD7 on breast cancer and the ability of SETD7 of regulating intrinsic redox homeostasis has never been investigated. In this study, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we revealed that SETD7 was a potential prognostic marker of breast cancer. Median survival time of patients with low SETD7 expression (18.1 years) was twice than that of SETD7 low-expressed patients (9.5 years). We demonstrated that SETD7 promoted tumor cell proliferation and prevented cell apoptosis and that SETD7 delicately maintained the redox homeostasis through regulating the levels of GSH/GSSG and ROS. Further studies indicated that SETD7 was a positive activator of KEAP1-NRF2 pathway. Using dual luciferase assay, we revealed the role of SETD7 as a transcriptional activator of antioxidant enzymes. Downregulation of SETD7 in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells impaired the expression of antioxidant enzymes and induces imbalance of redox status. Together, we proposed SETD7 as a prognostic marker of breast cancer and a novel antioxidant promoter under oxidative stress in breast cancer.
ABO remains the clinically most important blood group system, but despite earlier extensive research, significant findings are still being made. The vast majority of catalogued ABO null alleles are based on the c.261delG polymorphism. Apart from c.802G>A, other mechanisms for O alleles are rare. While analysing the data set from the 1000 Genomes (1000G) project, we encountered two previously uncharacterized deletions, which needed further exploration.
CA3 pyramidal cells display input-specific differences in the subunit composition of synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Although at low density, GluN2B contributes significantly to NMDAR-mediated EPSCs at mossy fibre synapses. Long-term potentiation (LTP) of NMDARs triggers a modification in the subunit composition of synaptic NMDARs by insertion of GluN2B. GluN2B subunits are essential for the expression of LTP of NMDARs at mossy fibre synapses.
SLC25A1 mutations are associated with combined D,L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (DL- 2HGA; OMIM #615182), characterized by muscular hypotonia, severe neurodevelopmental dysfunction and intractable seizures. SLC25A1 encodes the mitochondrial citrate carrier (CIC), which mediates efflux of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates citrate and isocitrate in exchange for cytosolic malate. Only a single family with an SLC25A1 mutation has been described in which mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction was documented, specifically in complex IV. Five infants of two consanguineous Bedouin families of the same tribe presented with small head circumference and neonatal-onset encephalopathy with severe muscular weakness, intractable seizures, respiratory distress, and lack of psychomotor development culminating in early death. Ventricular septal defects (VSD) were demonstrated in three patients. Blood and CSF lactate were elevated with normal levels of plasma amino acids and free carnitine and increased 2-OH-glutaric acid urinary exertion. EEG was compatible with white matter disorder. Brain MRI revealed ventriculomegaly, thin corpus callosum with increased lactate peak on spectroscopy. Mitochondrial complex V deficiency was demonstrated in skeletal muscle biopsy of one infant. Homozygosity mapping and sequencing ruled out homozygosity of affected individuals in all known complex V-associated genes. Whole exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous SLC25A1 c.713A>G (p.Asn238Ser) mutation, segregating as expected in the affected kindred and not found in 220 control alleles. Thus, SLC25A1 mutations might be associated with mitochondrial complex V deficiency and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mitochondrial respiratory chain defects.
CYP3A4 and CYP4A5 share specificity for a wide range of xenobiotics with the CYP3 subfamily collectively involved in the biotransformation of approximately 30% of all drugs. CYP3A4/5 mRNA transcripts have been reported in the skin, yet knowledge of their protein expression and function is lacking. In this study, we observed gene and protein expression of CYP3A4/5 in both human skin and tissue-engineered skin equivalents (TESEs), and enzyme activity was detected using the model substrate benzyl-O-methyl-cyanocoumarin. Mass spectrometric analysis of TESE lysates following testosterone application revealed a time-dependent increase in metabolite production, confirming the functional expression of these enzymes in skin.
CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 are important extra-hepatic cytochromes, expressed in the colon and involved in the metabolism of dietary constituents and exogenous compounds. CYP1B1 expression is increased by pro-inflammatory cytokines, and it has been recently implicated in regulation of blood brain barrier function. We investigated its involvement in the increased permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier observed in inflammatory conditions.
SETDB1 is an essential H3K9 methyltransferase involved in silencing of retroviruses and gene regulation. We show here that its triple Tudor domain (3TD) specifically binds to doubly modified histone H3 containing K14 acetylation and K9 methylation. Crystal structures of 3TD in complex with H3K14ac/K9me peptides reveal that peptide binding and K14ac recognition occurs at the interface between Tudor domains (TD) TD2 and TD3. Structural and biochemical data demonstrate a pocket switch mechanism in histone code reading, because K9me1 or K9me2 is preferentially recognized by the aromatic cage of TD3, while K9me3 selectively binds to TD2. Mutations in the K14ac/K9me binding sites change the sub-nuclear localization of 3TD. ChIP-seq analyses show that SETDB1 is enriched at H3K9me3 regions and K9me3/K14ac is enriched at SETDB1 binding sites overlapping with LINE elements, suggesting that recruitment of the SETDB1 complex to K14ac/K9me regions has a role in silencing of active genomic regions.
CD38 is an ectoenzyme and receptor with key physiological roles. It metabolizes NAD
PDE4D polymorphism (SNP83/rs966221) was reported to be associated with the susceptibility to ischemic stroke (IS), however, the results were inconclusive. An electronic search of Embase, PubMed, CNKI and Wan Fang Date was performed to identify relevant studies published throughout April 2017. A total of 26 studies were enrolled in the analysis. No significant association between the rs9662221 polymorphism and IS was observed in the overall analysis. Nevertheless, in the subgroup analysis, our results showed a significant association between the SNP83 polymorphism and IS in CC+ CT vs. TT (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.02-1.38), CT vs.TT (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.01-1.29) and C vs. T (OR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.06-1.48) in Asian population. But we did not found any association in CC vs. CT + TT (OR = 1.2, 95% CI: 0.9-1.61) and CC vs. TT (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.91-1.75) in the Asian populations. Meantime, no significant correlations were observed under the five genetic model in Caucasian population (p > 0.05). In conclusion, our meta-analysis demonstrated that the SNP83 polymorphism in the PDE4D gene might contribute to IS susceptibility especially in Asian populations. Whereas the relationship of the polymorphism to the disease in Caucasian population was still in controversial. In future, additional well designed studies with larger sample sizes are still required to further elucidate this association.
CLC type anion transport proteins are homo-dimeric or hetero-dimeric with an integrated transport function in each subunit. We have identified and partially characterized three members of this family named TbVCL1, TbVCL2 and TbVCL3 in Trypanosoma brucei. Among the human CLC family members, the T. brucei proteins display highest similarity to CLC-6 and CLC-7. TbVCL1, but not TbVCL2 and TbVCL3 is able to complement growth of a CLC-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant. All TbVCL-HA fusion proteins localize intracellulary in procyclic form trypanosomes. TbVCL1 localizes close to the Golgi apparatus and TbVCL2 and TbVCL3 to the endoplasmic reticulum. Upon expression in Xenopus oocytes, all three proteins induce similar outward rectifying chloride ion currents. Currents are sensitive to low concentrations of DIDS, insensitive to the pH in the range 5.4 to 8.4 and larger in nitrate than in chloride medium.
CYP21A2 genotyping remains an important element in the diagnosis and management of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and establishing accurate genotype-phenotype correlations has facillitated adequate genetic counseling and prenatal management for at-risk families. Despite extensive efforts to establish a clear genotype-phenotype correlation, some discordance remains. Establishing a diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia on the basis of biochemical and clinical data is occasionally challenging, and the identification of CYP21A2 mutations may help confirm the diagnosis. We review the diagnostic challenges despite an extensive genetic evaluation for 14 patients with a suspected clinical and biochemical diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Other diagnostic entities should be considered in the absence of convincing genetic data.
PAH is a progressive life-threatening disease in children. While parenteral prostacyclin therapy improves survival in patients with severe PAH, central line-related complications are common. Our aim was to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of subcutaneous treprostinil treatment in pediatric PAH patients. Eight patients were treated with subcutaneous treprostinil at the Pediatric Heart Center Budapest. Indications for subcutaneous treprostinil therapy were clinical worsening and/or echocardiographic progression or switch from intravenous to subcutaneous therapy. Following treprostinil initiation, clinical status improved or did not change in four of eight patients. Two patients were lost early during treprostinil therapy, parenteral treprostinil as a rescue therapy being insufficient in these cases. The final dose in long-term treated patients was between 60 and 100 ng/kg/min. Aside from thrombocytopenia, other severe side effects were not observed. Potts shunt was performed as palliative treatment in two cases. Three patients had successful lung transplantation, and one died while on the waiting list. Long-term subcutaneous treprostinil could be a safe and well-tolerated therapy in children with severe PAH even at higher doses. It may serve as an alternative to intravenous prostacyclin treatment allowing to avoid the potential complications of permanent central line placement.
DUOX2 and DUOXA2 form the predominant H2O2-producing system in human colorectal mucosa. Inflammation, hypoxia, and 5-aminosalicylic acid increase H2O2 production, supporting innate defense and mucosal healing. Thiocyanate reacts with H2O2 in the presence of lactoperoxidase (LPO) to form hypothiocyanate (OSCN-), which acts as a biocide and H2O2 scavenging system to reduce damage during inflammation. We aimed to discover the organization of Duox2, Duoxa2, and Lpo expression in colonic crypts of Lieberkühn (intestinal glands) of mice and how distributions respond to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and subsequent mucosal regeneration.
CYP2C19 genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention is increasingly implemented in clinical practice. However, challenges such as selecting a testing platform, communicating test results, building clinical decision support processes, providing patient and provider education, and integrating methods to support the translation of emerging evidence to clinical practice are barriers to broad adoption. In this report, we compare and contrast implementation strategies of 12 early adopters, describing solutions to common problems and initial performance metrics for each program. Key differences between programs included the test result turnaround time and timing of therapy changes, which are both related to the CYP2C19 testing model and platform used. Sites reported the need for new informatics infrastructure, expert clinicians such as pharmacists to interpret results, physician champions, and ongoing education. Consensus lessons learned are presented to provide a path forward for those seeking to implement similar clinical pharmacogenomics programs within their institutions.
CYP2C9 is the most abundant CYP2C subfamily enzyme in human liver and the most important contributor from this subfamily to drug metabolism. Polymorphisms resulting in decreased enzyme activity are common in the 
CYP17A1 is a key steroidogenic enzyme known to conduct several distinct chemical transformations on multiple substrates. In its hydroxylase activity, this enzyme adds a hydroxyl group at the 17α position of both pregnenolone and progesterone at approximately equal rates. However, the subsequent 17,20 carbon-carbon scission reaction displays variable substrate specificity in the numerous CYP17A1 isozymes operating in vertebrates, manifesting as different K
NAMPT expression is elevated in many cancers, making this protein a potential target for anticancer therapy. We have carried out both NMR based and TR-FRET based fragment screens against human NAMPT and identified six novel binders with a range of potencies. Co-crystal structures were obtained for two of the fragments bound to NAMPT while for the other four fragments force-field driven docking was employed to generate a bound pose. Based on structural insights arising from comparison of the bound fragment poses to that of bound FK866 we were able to synthetically elaborate one of the fragments into a potent NAMPT inhibitor.
IDH1 mutation (mIDH1) occurs in 20-30% of gliomas and is a promising target for the cancer therapy. In this article, a cross docking-based virtual screening was employed to identify seven small molecules for the allosteric site of mIDH1. Compounds ZX01, ZX05 and ZX06 exhibited the potent inhibitory activity and the high selectivity against WT-IDH1, providing a good starting point for the further development of highly selective mIDH1 inhibitors. Importantly, the parallel artificial membrane permeation assay of the blood-brain barrier (PAMPA-BBB) identified ZX06 with a good ability to penetrate BBB. These findings indicate that ZX06 deserves further optimization as a lead compound for the treatment of patients with IDH1 mutated brain cancers.
NQO1 is a FAD containing NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase that catalyzes the reduction of quinones and related substrates. In cells, NQO1 participates in a number of binding interactions with other proteins and mRNA and these interactions may be influenced by the concentrations of reduced pyridine nucleotides. NAD(P)H can protect NQO1 from proteolytic digestion suggesting that binding of reduced pyridine nucleotides results in a change in NQO1 structure. We have used purified NQO1 to demonstrate the addition of NAD(P)H induces a change in the structure of NQO1; this results in the loss of immunoreactivity to antibodies that bind to the C-terminal domain and to helix 7 of the catalytic core domain. Under normal cellular conditions NQO1 is not immunoprecipitated by these antibodies, however, following treatment with β-lapachone which caused rapid oxidation of NAD(P)H NQO1 could be readily pulled-down. Similarly, immunostaining for NQO1 was significantly increased in cells following treatment with β-lapachone demonstrating that under non-denaturing conditions the immunoreactivity of NQO1 is reflective of the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H ratio. In untreated human cells, regions with high intensity immunostaining for NQO1 co-localize with acetyl α-tubulin and the NAD+-dependent deacetylase Sirt2 on the centrosome(s), the mitotic spindle and midbody during cell division. These data provide evidence that during the centriole duplication cycle NQO1 may provide NAD+ for Sirt2-mediated deacetylation of microtubules. Overall, NQO1 may act as a redox-dependent switch where the protein responds to the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H redox environment by altering its structure promoting the binding or dissociation of NQO1 with target macromolecules.
GNE myopathy is a rare distal myopathy, caused by mutations in the GNE gene, affecting sialic acid synthesis. Clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic early stage patients to severely debilitating forms. This first report describes clinical presentations and severity of the disease, using data of 150 patients collected via the on-line, patient-reported registry component of the GNE Myopathy Disease Monitoring Program (GNEM-DMP). Disease progression was prospectively analysed, over a 2-year period, using the GNE myopathy functional activity scale (GNEM-FAS). The average annual rates of decline in function were estimated at -9.6% and -3.2% in ambulant and non-ambulant patients respectively. 4.3% of participants became non-ambulant within one year. The mean time from onset to required use of a wheelchair was 11.9 years. Mean delay of genetic diagnosis from symptom onset was 5.2 years. Mutation specific analysis demonstrated genotype-phenotype relationships; i.e. p.Ala662Val may be associated with a more severe phenotype, compared to p.Val727Met. Patients with compound heterozygous mutation in epimerase and kinase domain appeared to have a more severe phenotype compared to patients with both mutations located within one domain. Acknowledging the limitations of the study, these findings suggest that the severity of the GNE mutations affects disease severity. The GNEM-DMP is a useful data collection tool, prospectively measuring the progression of GNE myopathy, which could play an important role in translational and clinical research and further understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations.
ABCA1 functions as a lipid transporter because it mediates the transfer of cellular phospholipid (PL) and free (unesterified) cholesterol (FC) to apoA-I and related proteins present in the extracellular medium. ABCA1 is a membrane PL translocase and its enzymatic activity leads to transfer of PL molecules from the cytoplasmic leaflet to the exofacial leaflet of a cell plasma membrane (PM). The presence of active ABCA1 in the PM promotes binding of apoA-I to the cell surface. About 10% of this bound apoA-I interacts directly with ABCA1 and stabilizes the transporter. Most of the pool of cell surface-associated apoA-I is bound to lipid domains in the PM that are created by the activity of ABCA1. The amphipathic α-helices in apoA-I confer detergent-like properties on the protein enabling it to solubilize PL and FC in these membrane domains to create a heterogeneous population of discoidal nascent HDL particles. This review focuses on current understanding of the structure-function relationships of human ABCA1 and the molecular mechanisms underlying HDL particle production.
GNE myopathy is a rare autosomal recessive myopathy caused by bi-allelic mutations in GNE. We report the case of a 36-year-old man who presented with typical clinical and pathological features of GNE myopathy including distal dominant muscle weakness from the age of 29 and numerous rimmed vacuoles on muscle biopsy. Targeted next-generation sequencing revealed a novel synonymous mutation, c.1500A>G (p.G500=), together with a common Japanese mutation c.620A>T (p.D207V). The cDNA analysis of the biopsied muscle revealed that this synonymous mutation creates a cryptic splice donor site that causes aberrant splicing. This report will expand our understanding of the genetic heterogeneity of GNE myopathy emphasizing the importance of interpreting synonymous variants in genetic testing.
CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) is a complex disease that influenced by various environmental and genetic factors. Previous studies have found many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of CAD occurrence. However, the results are inconsistent. In this study, we aim to investigate genetic etiology in Chinese Han population by analysis of 7 SNPs in lipid metabolism pathway that previously has been reported to be associated with CAD.
" OTC combination cold remedies are widely used in Japan. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the adverse event profiles of OTC combination cold remedy based on the components using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. The JADER database contained 430587 reports between April 2004 and November 2016. 1084 adverse events associated with the use of OTC combination cold remedy were reported. Reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect safety signals. The ROR values for ""skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders"", ""hepatobiliary disorders"", and ""immune system disorders"" stratified by system organ class of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) were 9.82 (8.71-11.06), 2.63 (2.25-3.07), and 3.13 (2.63-3.74), respectively. OTC combination cold remedy containing acetaminophen exhibited a significantly higher reporting ratio for ""hepatobiliary disorders"" than OTC combination cold remedy without acetaminophen. We demonstrated the potential risk of OTC combination cold remedy in a real-life setting. Our results suggested that the monitoring of individuals using OTC combination cold remedy is important."
SETD1B (SET domain containing 1B) is a component of SET1 histone methyltransferase complex, which mediates the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 4 (H3K4). Here, we describe two unrelated individuals with de novo variants in SETD1B identified by trio-based whole exome sequencing: c.5524C>T, p.(Arg1842Trp) and c.5575C>T, p.(Arg1859Cy). The two missense variants occurred at evolutionarily conserved amino acids and are located within the SET domain, which plays a pivotal role in catalyzing histone methylation. Previous studies have suggested that de novo microdeletions in the 12q24.3 region encompassing SETD1B were associated with developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, autism/autistic behavior, large stature and craniofacial anomalies. Comparative mapping of 12q24.3 deletions refined the candidate locus, indicating KDM2B and SETD1B to be the most plausible candidate genes for the pathogenicity of 12q24.3 deletion syndrome. Our cases showed epilepsy, developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, autistic behavior and craniofacial dysmorphic features, which are consistent with those of individuals with de novo 12q24.31 deletions. Therefore, our study suggests that SETD1B aberration is likely to be the core defect in 12q24.3 deletion syndrome.
SLC26A3 encodes a Cl
CYP2D6 and SULT1A1 occasionally show copy number variations (CNVs), with a larger number generally indicating greater enzymic activity. However, those variations are difficult to calculate using standard methods. With digital PCR, a recently introduced method for CNV analysis, DNA molecules are subjected to limited dilution and separated into nano-scale droplets prior to a PCR assay. Absolute quantitation of copy number can then be performed with high accuracy and sensitivity by determining the number of droplets showing an amplified signal for the target gene. This is the first report of analyses of CYP2D6 and SULT1A1 CNVs using a digital PCR method with blood sample from Japanese subject. Primers and probes were synthesized for the target and reference genes, and copy number calculation was performed using a QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System. Our results showed that the copy numbers in CYP2D6*5 hetero, non-CNV, and CYP2D6xN subjects were 1, 2, and 3 to 4, respectively. In addition, in non-CNV and multiplication subjects, the number of copies for SULT1A1 was 2 and 3 to 6, respectively. We found that the present digital PCR method was useful as well as accurate. In the future, a combined genotyping, allele distinction, and copy number calculation technique will be helpful for analysis of enzymic activity.
G6PD deficiency is quite common in Italy where it is characterized by extreme molecular and biochemical heterogeneity. We report a 15-year-old Italian boy with 
AGA is a common disorder. Different treatments are available to prevent hair loss and achieve hair growth with variable results. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel fractional radiofrequency (RF) device (HairLux, Innogen Technologies Ltd., Yokneam, Israel), to prevent hair loss and induce hair growth. Twenty-five patients received 10 fractional RF treatments every 2 weeks, and were followed up 2 months after the last treatment. All patients were evaluated by global photography. In 10 patients, blinded manual hair counts were performed. Patients demonstrated less hair shedding, fuller hair, and faster hair growth. There was an average increase of 31.6% in hair density (based on hair counts) and 18% increase in hair shaft thickness. All subjects tolerated the treatments well. The HairLux device is effective and safe for hair growth stimulation in AGA. Ten treatment sessions are recommended to maximize results.
SMS reminders sent to personal mobiles are increasingly used by clinical services to promote patient engagement, including adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV. From August to September 2015, a 6-week, randomised SMS reminder for ART adherence intervention was implemented among 98 HIV-positive clients of Australian's largest HIV charitable organisation located in Sydney. This was followed by a mixed-method evaluation, comprising a self-completed online survey and a one-to-one interview. Of the 62 survey participants, all being men, the majority were gay (85.5%) and living long-term with HIV (median year of HIV diagnosis = 1998). While everyone was on ART, a substantial proportion (n = 27, 43.5%) had interrupted treatment in the past. At the end of the intervention, based on the standard SMAQ measure, 82% had consistently adhered to ART in the previous week. While there was no statistically significant intervention effect, perceiving less stigma were independently associated with better ART adherence (adjusted odds ratio = 0.37; 95% CI 0.16-0.89; P = .026). Of the 11 interviewees, despite limited add-on effects on individual ART adherence, the campaign was well-received as a unique community support service. This study underscores the essential role of empowerment through enhancing disease self-management, increasing social support and reducing stigma, particularly for long-term HIV survivors. SMS messaging, part of mHealth, delivered by community services could have broader impacts on reducing health and social inequity.
ABCG2 rs2231142 (Q141K) has been reported to be associated with poor response to allopurinol, while there are conflicting data on the association between the genetically independent ABCG2 rs10011796 variant and allopurinol response. The aim of this study was to replicate the association of ABCG2 rs2231142 and rs10011796 with allopurinol response and perform a meta-analysis.
CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms are considered a major contributor to the large interindividual variability in CYP2D6-mediated drug metabolism, but fail to explain a significant portion of the variability. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of the CYP2D6 activity score (AS) estimated from CYP2D6 genotype to predict CYP2D6 expression and enzyme activity. The CYP2D6 gene region was sequenced in 115 healthy human liver tissue samples to determine their CYP2D6 AS. Additionally, CYP2D6 enzyme activity, protein, and mRNA levels were estimated. CYP2D6 AS explained 23% of the interindividual variability in CYP2D6 activity, but only 7.5% in tissues assigned AS 1-2. The CYP2D6 protein level was found to be the major determinant of CYP2D6 activity, explaining 59% of variability. These findings suggest that while CYP2D6 AS is a good predictor of poor metabolizer phenotype, additional nongenetic factors may govern the rate of CYP2D6-mediated metabolism in those without the poor metabolizer phenotype.
PIK3CA gene mutations have clinical importance and their presence is associated with therapy response. They are also considered as a molecule for targeted therapy. As regards to their importance, genetic variation within a population as well as among different populations, this study was conducted to detect common mutations of exons 9 and 20 and other probable mutations in PIK3CA gene as well as their frequencies in Iranian bladder cancer patients.
CP is a copper-containing ferroxidase of blood plasma, which acts as an acute phase reactant during inflammation. The effect of oxidative modification of CP induced by oxidants produced by MPO, such as HOCl, HOBr, and HOSCN, on its spectral, enzymatic, and anti-inflammatory properties was studied. We monitored the chemiluminescence of lucigenin and luminol along with fluorescence of hydroethidine and scopoletin to assay the inhibition by CP of the neutrophilic respiratory burst induced by PMA or fMLP. Superoxide dismutase activity of CP and its capacity to reduce the production of oxidants in respiratory burst of neutrophils remained virtually unchanged upon modifications caused by HOCl, HOBr, and HOSCN. Meanwhile, the absorption of type I copper ions at 610 nm became reduced, along with a drop in the ferroxidase and amino oxidase activities of CP. Likewise, its inhibitory effect on the halogenating activity of MPO was diminished. Sera of either healthy donors or patients with Wilson disease were co-incubated with neutrophils from healthy volunteers. In these experiments, we observed an inverse relationship between the content of CP in sera and the rate of H
PNPO deficiency is responsible of severe neonatal encephalopathy, responsive to pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) or pyridoxine. Recent studies widened the phenotype of this condition and detected new genetic variants on PNPO gene, whose pathogenetic role and clinical expression remain to be established. One of these mutations, Arg116Gln, is of particular interest because of its later onset of symptoms (beyond the first months of life) and its peculiar epileptic manifestations in patients. This protein variant was expressed as recombinant protein in 
GBA encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), an enzyme involved in sphingolipid metabolism. Mutations in the GBA gene are numerically the most important risk factor for developing Parkinson disease (PD) accounting for at least 5% of all PD cases. Furthermore, loss of GCase activity is found in sporadic PD brains. Lysosomal dysfunction is thought to play a principal role in PD pathogenesis and in particular its effect on the metabolism of α-synuclein. A hallmark of PD is the presence of intraneuronal protein inclusions called Lewy bodies, which are composed mainly of α-synuclein. Cellular and animal models of GCase deficiency result in lysosomal dysfunction, and in particular the autophagy lysosome pathway, resulting in the accumulation of α-synuclein. Some forms of mutant GCase unfold in the endoplasmic reticulum activating the unfolded protein response, which might also contribute to PD pathogenesis. It has also been suggested that accumulation of GCase substrates glucosylceramide/glucosylsphingosine may contribute to GBA-PD pathogenesis. Mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation are associated with GCase deficiency and have also been implicated in the aetiology of PD. This review discusses these points and highlights potential treatments that might be effective in treating GCase deficiency in PD.
CYP2D6 pathway mediates the activation of primaquine into active metabolite(s) in hepatocytes. CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic, encoding CYP2D6 isoforms with normal, reduced, null or increased activity. It is hypothesized that Plasmodium vivax malaria patients with defective CYP2D6 function would be at increased risk for primaquine failure to prevent recurrence. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of CYP2D6 polymorphisms and inferred CYP2D6 phenotypes with malaria recurrence in patients from the Western Brazilian Amazon, following chloroquine/primaquine combined therapy.
AQP2 water channel is critical for urinary concentration in the kidney. Interestingly, AQP2 is abundantly excreted in the urine as extracellular vesicles (EVs), which is known to be a useful biomarker for water-balance disorders although the character of AQP2-enriched EVs is poorly understood including water channel function.
ATP1A3 mutations are related to a wide spectrum of clinical conditions, including several defined syndromes as rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP), alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC), and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS), together with many other intermediate phenotypes. Ataxia is always more increasingly reported, either as accessory or prominent sign, in ATP1A3-related conditions, being thus considered as a peculiar feature of this spectrum. Here, we report three cases of childhood rapid-onset ataxia due to two different ATP1A3 variants. Interestingly, two patients (mother and son) showed a variant c.2266C>T (p.R756C), while the third carried the c.2452G>A (p.E818K) variant, commonly described in association with CAPOS syndrome. Our report contributes to extent the phenotypic spectrum of ATP1A3 mutations, remarking childhood rapid-onset ataxia as an additional clinical presentation of ATP1A3-related conditions. Finally, we discussed this phenomenology in the light of translational evidence from a RDP animal model.
CYP2B6 is a human microsomal cytochrome P450 enzyme with broad substrate selectivity. CYP2B6 is the only functional member of the human CYP2B gene subfamily, which differs from the situation in rodents, such as mouse, where multiple functional Cyp2b genes are expressed. Recent studies with Cyp2b knockout or knockdown mouse models have yielded insights into the in vivo roles of mouse CYP2B enzymes in drug disposition and xenobiotic toxicity. A CYP2B6-humanized mouse model (CYP2A13/2B6/2F1-transgenic/Cyp2abfgs-null), which expresses human CYP2B6 in the liver, and human CYP2A13 and CYP2F1 in the respiratory tract, but not any of the mouse Cyp2b genes, has also been established. In the CYP2B6-humanized mouse, the CYP2B6 transgene is expressed primarily in the liver, where it was found to be active toward prototype CYP2B6 substrate drugs. The regulatory elements of the CYP2B6 transgene appear to be compatible with mouse nuclear receptors that mediate CYP2B induction. Therefore, the CYP2B6-humanized mouse is a valuable animal model for studying the impact of CYP2B6 expression or induction on drug metabolism, drug efficacy, drug-drug interaction, and drug/xenobiotic toxicity. In this mini-review, we provide a brief background on CYP2B6 and the Cyp2b-knockout and CYP2B6-humanized mice, and discuss the potential applications and limitations of the current models.
ABO hemolytic disease occurs among neonates with blood groups A or B delivered to group O women. Extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia due to ABO disease has been reported, but its frequency is not well known. We sought to determine the odds of developing severe ABO hemolytic disease in the 13 years since adopting universal bilirubin screening/management in the Intermountain Healthcare system.
RBP4 (plasma retinol-binding protein) is the 21 kDa transporter of all-trans retinol that circulates in plasma as a moderately tight 1:1 molar complex of the vitamin with the protein. RBP4 is primarily synthesized in the liver but is also produced by adipose tissue and circulates bound to a larger protein, transthyretin, TTR, that serves to increase its molecular mass and thus avoid its elimination by glomerular filtration. This paper reports the high resolution three-dimensional structures of human RBP4 naturally lacking bound retinol purified from plasma, urine and amniotic fluid. In all these crystals we found a fatty acid molecule bound in the hydrophobic ligand-binding site, a result confirmed by mass spectrometry measurements. In addition we also report the 1.5 Å resolution structures of human holo-RBP4 and of the protein saturated with palmitic and lauric acid and discuss the interaction of the fatty acids and retinol with the protein.
CD38 is a plasma membrane bound multifunctional enzyme. It can be activated by inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-13, inducing calcium responses to agonist in airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC). Previous studies have found that high-fat-diet (HFD) induced obesity exhibited innate airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). This study aimed to detect the effect of CD38 signaling pathway on the AHR of overweight/obese mice. The HFD-fed mice exhibited a significantly higher baseline airway resistance (Rn), and the increasing rates of Rn responded to increasing doses of methacholine compared with the LFD-fed mice. High-fat-diet increased CD38 expressions both in lung tissues and primary cultured ASMCs. Besides, preincubation with TNF-α led to a higher expression of CD38 protein and increased intracellular calcium in ASMC of the HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, CD38 gene knockdown through transfection of CD38 siRNA decreased the concentration of intracellular calcium. Additionally, the upregulations of CD38 protein and CD38 mRNA were also found in the lung tissues of HFD-fed mice challenged by ovalbumin (OVA). Collectively, our findings demonstrated a role of CD38 signaling pathway on the AHR of obesity and might be a potential therapeutic target for treating difficult-to-control obese asthma phenotype.
SDS plays a key role in proteomics workflows, including protein extraction, solubilization and mass-based separations (e.g. SDS-PAGE, GELFrEE). However, SDS interferes with mass spectrometry and so it must be removed prior to analysis. We recently introduced an electrophoretic platform, termed transmembrane electrophoresis (TME), enabling extensive depletion of SDS from proteins in solution with exceptional protein yields. However, our prior TME runs required 1 h to complete, being limited by Joule heating which causes protein aggregation at higher operating currents. Here, we demonstrate effective strategies to maintain lower TME sample temperatures, permitting accelerated SDS depletion. Among these strategies, the use of a magnetic stir bar to continuously agitate a model protein system (BSA) allows SDS to be depleted below 100 ppm (>98% removal) within 10 min of TME operations, while maintaining exceptional protein recovery (>95%). Moreover, these modifications allow TME to operate without any user intervention, improving throughput and robustness of the approach. Through fits of our time-course SDS depletion curves to an exponential model, we calculate SDS depletion half-lives as low as 1.2 min. This promising electrophoretic platform should provide proteomics researchers with an effective purification strategy to enable MS characterization of SDS-containing proteins.
CYP2D6 is responsible for the metabolism of approximately 25% of all drugs. The expression of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is influenced by a combination of factors including polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene. Analysis of the CYP2D6 genotype is used to personalize the medication to a patient's metabolism. Although many genotypes can be determined using standard genotype analysis, in some cases, an incomplete analysis is performed. The CYP2D6 genotype *1/*4 often occurs in combination with a multiplication of the CYP2D6 gene, and is reported as (*1/*4)xN. Accurate determination of the multiplied gene is essential to provide a phenotype prediction for these patients. Duplication of the *1 gene leads to an extensive metabolizer genotype whereas multiplication of the *4 gene would not lead to extra functional enzyme and therefore provides an intermediate metabolizer phenotype.
IDH1 mutations are oncogenic through induction of DNA damage and genome instability. They are of therapeutic interest because they confer increased sensitivity to radiation and cytotoxic therapy and hold potential for vaccination therapy.
UGT2B10 is an important metabolism enzyme in human body and its substrates include multiple amine-containing compounds, especially nicotine, tamoxifen and multiple antidepressants. Multiple common SNPs have been observed in its promoter region, but their role in expression regulation has never been investigated. In this preliminary study, we identified a novel cis-regulatory SNP, rs294775, for UGT2B10 by plasmid construction, mutagenesis, and luciferase assay, whose mechanism was also investigated. Our work provides a basis for further pharmacogenetics study.
LCAT is an enzyme responsible for the formation of cholesteryl esters from unesterified cholesterol (UC) and phospholipid (PL) molecules in HDL particles. However, it is poorly understood how LCAT interacts with lipoproteins and how apoA-I activates it. Here we have studied the interactions between LCAT and lipids through molecular simulations. In addition, we studied the binding of LCAT to apoA-I-derived peptides, and their effect on LCAT lipid association-utilizing experiments. Results show that LCAT anchors itself to lipoprotein surfaces by utilizing nonpolar amino acids located in the membrane-binding domain and the active site tunnel opening. Meanwhile, the membrane-anchoring hydrophobic amino acids attract cholesterol molecules next to them. The results also highlight the role of the lid-loop in the lipid binding and conformation of LCAT with respect to the lipid surface. The apoA-I-derived peptides from the LCAT-activating region bind to LCAT and promote its lipid surface interactions, although some of these peptides do not bind lipids individually. The transfer free-energy of PL from the lipid bilayer into the active site is consistent with the activation energy of LCAT. Furthermore, the entry of UC molecules into the active site becomes highly favorable by the acylation of SER181.
CYP3A5 is the predominant sub-family of biotransformation enzymes in the liver and the genetic variations in CYP3A5 are an important determinant of inter-individual and inter-ethnic differences in CYP3A-mediated drug disposition and response.
SETD2 (SET domain containing protein 2) acts as a histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36)-specific methyltransferase and may play important roles in active gene transcription in human cells. However, its expression and role in porcine oocytes and preimplantation embryos are not well understood. Here, we used immunofluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy to examine SETD2 expression in porcine fetal fibroblasts, oocytes, and preimplantation embryos derived from in vitro fertilization (IVF), parthenogenetic activation (PA), and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In porcine fetal fibroblasts, SETD2 expression was detected in interphase cells, but not in M (mitotic)-phase cells. The SETD2 signal was observed in non-surrounded nucleolus (NSN)-stage oocytes, but not in surrounded nucleolus (SN)-, metaphase I (MI)-, or metaphase II (MII)-stage oocytes. The SETD2 signal was detectable in sperm, and undetectable immediately after fertilization, detectable at the 2-cell stage, and peaked at the 4-cell stage of IVF embryos in which porcine embryonic genome is activated. Similar to the pattern found in IVF embryos, the SETD2 signal was absent from PA embryos at the 1-cell stage, but it was detected at the 2-cell stage and thereafter maintained to the blastocyst stage. Interestingly, unlike the IVF and PA embryos, the SETD2 signal was detected throughout the development of SCNT embryos, including at the 1-cell stage. These data suggest that SETD2 may be functional for embryonic gene transcription in porcine preimplantation embryos. It is further speculated that the aberrant expression of SETD2 at the 1-cell stage of porcine SCNT embryos may be a factor in the low efficiency of cloning in pig.
CD38 is considered a potential biomarker for multiple myeloma (MM) and has shown a strong link with chronic lymphocytic leukemia due to high and uniform expression on plasma cells. In vivo evaluation of CD38 expression may provide useful information about lesion detection and prognosis of treatment in MM. In this study, immunoPET imaging with 
CYP24A1 is an enzyme that inactivates vitamin D. Loss-of-function mutations in this enzyme are rare but have been linked with idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia as well as adult-onset nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. Genetic testing for this mutation should be considered in the presence of calciuria, elevated serum calcium, elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and suppressed parathyroid hormone. We present a case with these lab findings as well as an elevated 25-hydroxyvitamin D/24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ratio in whom compound heterozygous CYP24A1 mutations were found. His hypercalciuria resolved and 1,25-vitamin D level improved with ketoconazole treatment. We suggest that it is clinically important to identify patients with this phenotype as testing and treatment options are available which could reduce progression to chronic kidney disease in this population.
CA1 pyramidal neurons are a major output of the hippocampus and encode features of experience that constitute episodic memories. Feature-selective firing of these neurons results from the dendritic integration of inputs from multiple brain regions. While it is known that synchronous activation of spatially clustered inputs can contribute to firing through the generation of dendritic spikes, there is no established mechanism for spatiotemporal synaptic clustering. Here we show that single presynaptic axons form multiple, spatially clustered inputs onto the distal, but not proximal, dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. These compound connections exhibit ultrastructural features indicative of strong synapses and occur much more commonly in entorhinal than in thalamic afferents. Computational simulations revealed that compound connections depolarize dendrites in a biophysically efficient manner, owing to their inherent spatiotemporal clustering. Our results suggest that distinct afferent projections use different connectivity motifs that differentially contribute to dendritic integration.
AK2 is an adenylate phosphotransferase that localizes at the intermembrane spaces of the mitochondria, and its mutations cause a severe combined immunodeficiency with neutrophil maturation arrest named reticular dysgenesis (RD). Although the dysfunction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has been implicated, earlier developmental events that affect the fate of HSCs and/or hematopoietic progenitors have not been reported. Here, we used RD-patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a model of AK2-deficient human cells. Hematopoietic differentiation from RD-iPSCs was profoundly impaired. RD-iPSC-derived hemoangiogenic progenitor cells (HAPCs) showed decreased ATP distribution in the nucleus and altered global transcriptional profiles. Thus, AK2 has a stage-specific role in maintaining the ATP supply to the nucleus during hematopoietic differentiation, which affects the transcriptional profiles necessary for controlling the fate of multipotential HAPCs. Our data suggest that maintaining the appropriate energy level of each organelle by the intracellular redistribution of ATP is important for controlling the fate of progenitor cells.
ABCG2 encodes the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), an efflux membrane transporter important in the detoxification of xenobiotics. In the present study, the basal activity of the 
ABCD1 is a gene responsible for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), and is critical for the transport of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) into peroxisomes and subsequent β-oxidation. VLCFA-containing lipids accumulate in X-ALD patients, although the effect of ABCD1-deficiency on each lipid species in the central nervous system has not been fully characterized. In this study, each phospholipid and lysophospholipid species in Abcd1-deficient mice brains were profiled by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Among the phospholipid and lysophospholipid species that are significantly more enriched in Abcd1-deficient mice brains, VLCFA were present in 75, 15, 5, 4, and 1 species of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, lysophosphatidylcholine, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine, respectively. Most VLCFA were incorporated at the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Among the phospholipid species that are significantly less enriched in Abcd1-deficient mice brains, odd-numbered saturated or mono-unsaturated fatty acyl moieties are contained in all phosphatidylcholine species. In addition, a number of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine species contained highly unsaturated fatty acyl moieties. Intriguingly, 44:1 phosphatidylcholine with VLCFA was mainly distributed in the gray matter, such as the cortex, but not in the white matter in the cerebrum and cerebellum. These results show that ABCD1-deficiency causes metabolic alternation of long-chain fatty acids and VLCFA. Moreover, our results imply a molecular mechanism for the incorporation of saturated or monounsaturated VLCFA into the sn-1 position of phospholipids, and also indicate that the distribution of phospholipids with VLCFA may correlate with the development of X-ALD.
GNE myopathy is an adult onset recessive genetic disorder that affects distal muscles sparing the quadriceps. GNE gene mutations have been identified in GNE myopathy patients all over the world. Homozygosity is a common feature in GNE myopathy patients worldwide.
SETD1A enhances leukemic cell growth and survival independent of its methyltransferase activity.
MPO (myeloperoxidase) is a peroxidase enzyme secreted by activated leukocytes that plays a pathogenic role in cardiovascular disease, mainly by initiating endothelial dysfunction. The molecular mechanisms of the endothelial damaging action of MPO remain though largely elusive. Calpain is a calcium-dependent protease expressed in the vascular wall. Activation of calpains has been implicated in inflammatory disorders of the vasculature. Using endothelial cells and genetically modified mice, this study identifies the µ-calpain isoform as novel downstream signaling target of MPO in endothelial dysfunction. Mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells were stimulated with 10 nmol/L MPO for 180 minutes. MPO denitrosylated µ-calpain C-terminus domain, and time dependently activated µ-calpain, but not the m-calpain isoform. MPO also reduced Thr
PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome is a spectrum of disorders characterized by unique phenotypic features including multiple hamartomas caused by mutations of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN. Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome are representative diseases, and both have several common clinical features and differences. Because PTEN mutations are associated with an increased risk of malignancy including breast, thyroid, endometrial, and renal cancers, cancer surveillance is an important element of disease management. We report a germline mutation of the PTEN (c.723dupT, exon 7) identified in a young woman with a simultaneous occurrence of breast cancer, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and follicular neoplasm. This case suggests that it is critical for clinicians to recognize the phenotypic features associated with these syndromes to accurately diagnose them and provide preventive care.
KMT5A (known as PR-Set7/9, SETD8 and SET8), a member of the SET domain containing methyltransferase family specifically targeting H4K20 for methylation, has been implicated in multiple biological processes. In the present study, we identified that KMT5A was elevated in 50 pairs of papillary thyroid cancer tissue samples and in cell lines K1 and TPC-1 by qRT-PCR and western blotting, as well as by immunohistochemical staining. CCK-8 assay and flow cytometric analysis revealed that inhibition of KMT5A attenuated proliferation and induced apoptosis. Transwell assays revealed that cell migration and invasion were suppressed in KMT5A-knockdown cells. Moreover, the inhibition of KMT5A arrested the cell cycle in the G1/S phase of papillary thyroid cancer cells. The TCGA data revealed that elevated KMT5A expression was significantly correlated with extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis and advanced pathological stage of papillary thyroid cancer. Furthermore, we observed that inhibition of KMT5A suppressed the expression of SREBP1, SCD, FASN and ACC, key molecules involved in lipid metabolism and decreased the level of malondialdehyde in papillary thyroid cancer cells. In conclusion, KMT5A may be a novel oncogenic factor, specifically a regulator for lipid metabolism in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
PTEN deficiency often causes defects in DNA damage repair. Currently, effective therapies for breast cancer are lacking. ATM is an attractive target for cancer treatment. Previous studies suggested a synthetic lethality between PTEN and PARP. However, the synthetically lethal interaction between PTEN and ATM in breast cancer has not been reported. Moreover, the mechanism remains elusive. Here, using KU-60019, an ATM kinase inhibitor, we investigated ATM inhibition as a synthetically lethal strategy to target breast cancer cells with PTEN defects. We found that KU-60019 preferentially sensitizes PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells to cisplatin, though it also slightly enhances sensitivity of PTEN wild-type breast cancer cells. The increased cytotoxic sensitivity is associated with apoptosis, as evidenced by flow cytometry and PARP cleavage. Additionally, the increase of DNA damage accumulation due to the decreased capability of DNA repair, as indicated by γ-H2AX and Rad51 foci, also contributed to this selective cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, compared with PTEN wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells, PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells have lower level of Rad51, higher ATM kinase activity, and display the elevated level of DNA damage. Moreover, these differences could be further enlarged by cisplatin. Our findings suggest that ATM is a promising target for PTEN-defective breast cancer.
PIK3CA mutations are seemingly the most common driver mutations in breast cancer with H1047R and E545K being the most common of these, accounting together for around 60% of all PIK3CA mutations and have promising therapeutic implications. Given the low sensitivity and the high cost of current genotyping methods we sought to develop fast, simple and inexpensive assays for PIK3CA H1047R and E545K mutation screening in clinical material. The methods we describe are based on a real-time PCR including a mutation specific primer combined with a non-productive oligonucleotide which inhibits wild-type amplification and a parallel internal control reaction. We demonstrate consistent detection of PIK3CA H1047R mutant DNA in genomic DNA extracted from frozen breast cancer biopsies, FFPE material or cancer cell lines with a detection sensitivity of approximately 5% mutant allele fraction and validate these results using both Sanger sequencing and deep next generation sequencing methods. The detection sensitivity for PIK3CA E545K mutation was approximately 10%. We propose these methods as simple, fast and inexpensive diagnostic tools to determine PIK3CA mutation status.
CD36 deficiency is characterized by limited cellular long chain fatty acid uptake in the skeletal and cardiac muscles and often causes energy crisis in these muscles. However, suitable treatment for CD36 deficiency remains to be established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and metabolic effects of medium chain triacylglycerols (MCTs) in two CD36-deficient preschool children who often developed fasting hypoglycemia and exercise-induced myalgia.
ACSL3 is the only long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase consistently found on growing and mature lipid droplets (LDs), suggesting that this specific localization has biological relevance. Current models for LD growth propose that triglycerides are synthesized by enzymes at the LD surface, with activated fatty acids provided by LD localized ACSL3, thus allowing growth independent of the ER. Here, we tested this hypothesis by quantifying ACSL3 on LDs from human A431 cells. RNAi of ACSL3 reduced the oleoyl-CoA synthetase activity by 83%, suggesting that ACSL3 is by far the dominant enzyme of A431 cells. Molar quantification revealed that there are 1.4 million ACSL3 molecules within a single cell. Metabolic labeling indicated that each ACSL3 molecule contributed a net gain of 3.1 oleoyl-CoA/s. 3D reconstruction of confocal images demonstrated that 530 individual lipid droplets were present in an average oleate fed A431 cell. A representative single lipid droplet with a diameter of 0.66 μm contained 680 ACSL3 molecules on the surface. Subcellular fractionation showed that at least 68% of ACSL3 remain at the ER even during extensive fatty acid supplementation. High resolution single molecule microscopy confirmed the abundance of cytoplasmic ACSL3 outside of LDs. Model calculations for triglyceride synthesis using only LD localized ACSL3 gave significant slower growth of LDs as observed experimentally. In conclusion, although ACSL3 is an abundant enzyme on A431 LDs, the metabolic capacity is not sufficient to account for LD growth solely by the local synthesis of triglycerides.
PTEN is well known to function as a tumor suppressor that antagonizes oncogenic signaling and maintains genomic stability. The 
SLC7A11 is a gene that encodes a cystine-glutamate antiporter, which has been detected to be overexpressed in various cancers. Thus, we aimed to validate its expression and clinical significance in liver cancer.
CD36 is a multi-functional class B scavenger receptor, which acts as an important modulator of lipid homeostasis and immune responses.
DOT1L (the disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like), through its methyltransferase activity of H3K79, plays essential roles in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle regulation, and DNA damage response. In addition, DOT1L is believed to be involved in the development of MLL-rearranged leukemia driven by the MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) fusion proteins, which thus to be a crucial target for leukemia therapy. Hence, discovering of novel DOT1L inhibitors has been in a great demand. In this study, we initiated the discovering process from setting up the AlphaLISA based High Throughput Screening (HTS) assay of DOT1L. Combining with radioactive inhibition assay and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) binding assay, we identified compound 3 and its active analogues as novel DOT1L inhibitors with IC
CS proteins have been involved in the repair of a wide variety of DNA lesions. Here, we analyse the role of CS proteins in DNA break repair by studying histone H2AX phosphorylation in different cell cycle phases and DNA break repair by comet assay in CS-A and CS-B primary and transformed cells. Following methyl methane sulphate treatment a significant accumulation of unrepaired single strand breaks was detected in CS cells as compared to normal cells, leading to accumulation of double strand breaks in S and G2 phases. A delay in DSBs repair and accumulation in S and G2 phases were also observed following IR exposure. These data confirm the role of CSB in the suppression of NHEJ in S and G2 phase cells and extend this function to CSA. However, the repair kinetics of double strand breaks showed unique features for CS-A and CS-B cells suggesting that these proteins may act at different times along DNA break repair. The involvement of CS proteins in the repair of DNA breaks may play an important role in the clinical features of CS patients.
GUCY2D has been associated with autosomal recessive Leber congenital amaurosis and autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy. This report expands the phenotype of autosomal recessive mutations to congenital night blindness, which may slowly progress to mild retinitis pigmentosa.
CYP2A6 (CYP2A5 in mice) is mainly expressed in the liver. Hepatic CYP2A6 expression is increased in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In mice, hepatic CYP2A5 is induced by high fat diet (HFD) feeding. Hepatic CYP2A5 is also increased in monosodium glutamate-induced obese mice. NAFLD is associated with obesity. In this study, we examined whether obesity is related to CYP2A6.
SLCO1B1 polymorphisms have been reported to affect the responses to statin therapy. However, the association of these polymorphisms and lipid-lowering responses has been inconsistent.
SDS interferes with both bottom-up and top-down MS analysis, requiring removal prior to detection. Filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) is favored for bottom-up proteomics (BUP) while acetone precipitation is popular for top-down proteomics (TDP). We recently demonstrated acetone precipitation in a membrane filter cartridge. Alternatively, our automated electrophoretic device, termed transmembrane electrophoresis (TME), depletes SDS for both TDP and BUP studies. Here TME is compared to these two alternative methods of SDS depletion in both BUP and TDP workflows. To do so, a modified FASP method is described applicable to the SDS purification and recovery of intact proteins, suitable for LC/MS. All three methods reliably deplete >99.8% SDS. TME provide higher sample yields (average 90%) than FASP (55%) or acetone precipitation (57%), translating into higher total protein identifications (973 vs 877 FASP or 890 acetone) and higher spectral matches (2.5 times) per protein. In a top down workflow, each SDS-depletion method yields high-quality MS spectra for intact proteins. These results show each of these membrane-based strategies is capable of depleting SDS with high sample recovery and high spectra quality for both BUP and TDP studies.
PIK3CA mutations frequently occur in breast cancer patients. This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between PIK3CA mutations and neoadjuvant treatment response and to analyze the clinical implications.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor that is frequently lost in epithelial malignancies. A part of the tumor-suppressive properties of PTEN is attributed to its function in cell polarization and consequently its role in maintaining epithelial tissue integrity. However, surprisingly little is known about the function and regulation of PTEN during epithelial cell polarization. We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated gene disruption to delete PTEN in intestinal epithelial Ls174T:W4 cells, which upon differentiation form a microvillus-covered apical membrane (brush border) on a part of the cell cortex, independent of cell-cell junctions. We show that loss of PTEN results in the formation of a larger brush border that, in a fraction of the cells, even spans the entire plasma membrane, revealing that PTEN functions in the regulation of apical membrane size. Depletion of the phosphatase PTPL1 resulted in a similar defect. PTPL1 interacts with PTEN, and this interaction is necessary for apical membrane enrichment of PTEN. Importantly, phosphatase activity of PTPL1 is not required, indicating that PTPL1 functions as an anchor protein in this process. Our work thus demonstrates a novel function for PTEN during cell polarization in controlling apical membrane size and identifies PTPL1 as a critical apical membrane anchor for PTEN in this process.
CFTR biosynthesis is highly dynamic. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Okiyoneda et al. (2018) show that RFFL serves as a CFTR conformation scrutinizer at the plasma membrane. It recognizes misfolded CFTR proteins and marks them for degradation. This quality control mechanism may be explored to benefit cystic fibrosis patients.
GNE myopathy is an adult-onset muscle disorder characterized by impaired sialylation of (muscle) glycans, detectable by lectin histochemistry. We describe a standardized method to quantify (lectin-) fluorescence in muscle sections, applicable for diagnosis and response to therapy for GNE myopathy.
CD38 is a transmembrane protein expressed in B lymphocytes, and is able to induce responses as proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis. Several reports propose that CD38 deficiency accelerates autoimmune processes in murine models of autoimmune diabetes, lymphoproliferation and rheumatoid arthritis. Other reports have shown elevated CD38 expression in B and T cells from patients with autoimmunity; however, the role of CD38 is still unclear in the development of autoimmunity. Recently, it has been characterized as CD1d
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene inactivated in over 30% of human cancers. It encodes a lipid phosphatase that serves as a gatekeeper of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway. Germline mutation frequently occurs in this gene in patients diagnosed with PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS). PHTS individuals are characterized by macrocephaly, benign growth of multiple tissues and increased tumor risk. In addition, autistic phenotypes are found in 10-20% of individuals carrying the germline PTEN mutation with macrocephaly. In this report, 13 suspected PHTS patients were screened for mutation in the PTEN gene. A missense variant (c. 302T > C) substituting the isoleucine at codon 101 to a threonine, a single nucleotide insertion (c. 327-328insC) causing a frame shift mutation and termination at codon 109, and a nonsense variant (c. 1003C > T) truncated the protein at codon 335 were identified. The I101T mutation significantly reduced PTEN protein expression levels by 2.5- to 4.0-fold. Mechanistically, I101T reduced the protein half-life of PTEN possibly due to enhanced polyubiquitination at Lysine 13. However, the I101T mutant retained almost 30% of the lipid phosphatase activity of the wild-type protein. Finally, the I101T mutant has reduced phosphorylation at a PTEN auto-dephosphorylation site at Threonine 366 and a lowered ratio of nuclear to cytosolic protein level. These partial losses of multiple PTEN biochemical functions may contribute to the tissue overgrowth and autistic features of this PHTS patient. Autism Res 2018, 11: 1098-1109. © 2018 The Authors Autism Research published by International Society for Autism Research and Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: The genetics of autism spectrum disorders is highly complex with individual risk influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Mutation in the human PTEN gene confers a high risk of developing autistic behavior. This report revealed that PTEN mutations occurred in 23% of a selected group of Hong Kong patients harboring autistic features with gross overgrowth symptoms. Detailed characterization of a PTEN mutation revealed reduced protein stability as one of the underlying mechanisms responsible for reduced PTEN activity.
ABCG2 is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that protects tissues against xenobiotics, affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs and contributes to multidrug resistance. Although many inhibitors and modulators of ABCG2 have been developed, understanding their structure-activity relationship requires high-resolution structural insight. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of human ABCG2 bound to synthetic derivatives of the fumitremorgin C-related inhibitor Ko143 or the multidrug resistance modulator tariquidar. Both compounds are bound to the central, inward-facing cavity of ABCG2, blocking access for substrates and preventing conformational changes required for ATP hydrolysis. The high resolutions allowed for de novo building of the entire transporter and also revealed tightly bound phospholipids and cholesterol interacting with the lipid-exposed surface of the transmembrane domains (TMDs). Extensive chemical modifications of the Ko143 scaffold combined with in vitro functional analyses revealed the details of ABCG2 interactions with this compound family and provide a basis for the design of novel inhibitors and modulators.
EPHX2 (encoding soluble epoxide hydrolase [sEH]) converts biologically active epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), anti-inflammatory and profibrinolytic effectors, into the less biologically active metabolites, dihydroxyeicostrienoic acids. We sought to characterize the expression and the function of EPHX2 in diabetic corneas and during wound healing. The expression of EPHX2 at both mRNA and protein levels, as well as sEH enzymatic activity, was markedly upregulated in the tissues/cells, including corneal epithelial cells as well as the retina of human type 2 and mouse type 1 (streptozotocin [STZ] induced) and/or type 2 diabetes. 
CYP2C9 plays a major role in drug metabolism. It is highly polymorphic and among the variants, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 have been known to encode the protein with moderately to markedly reduced catalytic activity. Azole antifungals are among the most frequently used drugs in human pharmacotherapy and represent a widely used class of pesticides to which humans are inevitably exposed. Due to the similarities in CYP organization throughout species, azoles can interact not only with the target fungal CYP51 substrate-binding site but can also modulate the catalytic activity of human cytochrome P450s, including CYP2C9, causing severe adverse effects. In the present study the potency of azole-containing drugs and pesticides to inhibit recombinant wild-type CYP2C9*1 and the allelic variants CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 was evaluated. Significant differences were found in their affinity to CYP2C9*1, CYP2C9*2, and CYP2C9*3 as well as in the catalytic activity of CYP2C9 allelic variants. Moreover, addition of cytochrome b
CYP4F2 is an enzyme involved in the formation of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) from arachidonic acid and metabolizes vitamin K into an inactive form. Our objectives were to identify new CYP4F2 genetic variants and to characterize the functional consequences of the conversion of arachidonic acid into 20-HETE. We used direct DNA sequencing to identify a total of 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including four coding variants, A27V, R47C, P85A, and V433M, in 50 randomly selected subjects. Of these, A27V and P85A were new. Recombinant variant proteins were prepared using an Escherichia coli expression system, purified, and quantified via CO-difference spectral analysis. The conversion of arachidonic acid to 20-HETE by the coding variants was compared to that of the wild-type protein. Wild-type CYP4F2 exhibited the highest intrinsic clearance, followed by P85A, A27V, V433M, and R47C (40-65% of the wild-type value). The locations of the mutated residues in the three-dimensional protein structure were predicted by structural modeling, and the possible effects on 20-HETE synthesis discussed. In summary, we describe the allele frequency, haplotype distribution, and linkage disequilibrium of CYP4F2 and functionally analyze the CYP4F2 coding variants. Our findings suggest that individuals having the low-activity alleles of CYP4F2 may inefficiently convert arachidonic acid into 20-HETE. This may aid in our understanding of 20-HETE-related blood pressure problems and cardiovascular diseases when genotype-phenotype association studies are performed in the future.
NAMPT (Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase) catalyses the rate-limiting step in the NAD biosynthesis from nicotinamide and thereby regulates the activity of NAD-dependent enzymes. Cancer cells are highly dependent on NAD for energy and DNA repair processes and are assumed to be more susceptible to an inhibition of NAD synthesis than non-transformed cells. We aimed to investigate whether or not inhibition of NAMPT with its specific inhibitor FK866 can sensitize leukemia cells for chemotherapeutic agents. NAMPT protein abundance, enzymatic activity and NAD concentrations were significantly higher in Jurkat and Molt-4 leukemia cell lines compared to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Combination of etoposide and FK866 caused increased cell death in leukemia cell lines compared to etoposide alone. Etoposide decreased protein abundance of NAD-dependent deacetylases SIRTUIN1. After combining etoposide and FK866 treatment SIRTUIN2 was further decreased and accumulation and acetylation of the downstream target p53 was further enhanced in MOLT4 cells. Concomitantly, protein abundance of p21 and cleaved BAX was increased. Targeting NAMPT could be a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents such as etoposide against leukemia.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that inhibits cell proliferation by inhibiting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3 K) signaling pathway. The significance of PTEN mutations resulting in variable PTEN expression and their impact on prognosis of breast cancer is not well established. The objective of our study was to correlate the immunohistochemical expression of PTEN in the four major subtypes of breast carcinoma (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 positive, and Triple Negative) in a population of 202 African-American (AA) females with other clinicopathological factors.
ASL is useful in evaluating tumour blood flow and in detecting hypervascular tumours. The purpose of this study was to assess the additive value of ASL to non-contrast and contrast-enhanced (NC/CE)-T1WI for diagnosing residual or recurrent meningiomas.
PDE5A is a leading factor contributing to cGMP signaling and cardiac hypertrophy. However, microRNA-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of PDE5A has not been reported. The aim of this study is to screen the microRNAs that are able to regulate PDE5A and explore the function of the microRNAs in cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling.
CYP2C19 is an important drug-metabolizing enzyme, responsible for metabolism of approximately 10% of the drugs on the market. Large inter-individual differences exist in metabolic activities, which are primarily attributed to genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 gene. Conflicting results have been published about the role of CYP2C19 polymorphisms in metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates and clinical outcomes; thus, we aimed to investigate CYP2C19 genotype-phenotype associations, and we sought to elicit potential causes of discrepancies in the genotype-based prediction by incorporating the liver donors' demographic data, drug administration events and pathological conditions.
CLC proteins are a ubiquitously expressed family of chloride-selective ion channels and transporters. A dearth of pharmacological tools for modulating CLC gating and ion conduction limits investigations aimed at understanding CLC structure/function and physiology. Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a collection of 
NMNAT1 (nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1) encodes a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of NAD
PTEN is a tumour suppressor gene whose loss of function has been found to be present in a variety of neoplasms, both benign and malignant. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), loss of PTEN is associated with poorly differentiated cancer, advanced clinical stage and tendency to recur. The extent and meaning of PTEN loss in hepatocellular adenoma (HA), one of the precursor lesions for HCC, has not yet been analysed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible loss of PTEN expression in HA in the wider context of hepatocarcinogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis of PTEN expression was performed in non-neoplastic liver tissue, HAs and HCCs. It has been found that the loss of PTEN was markedly present in poorly differentiated HCC, whereas well to moderately differentiated HCC showed similar levels of PTEN expression to nonneoplastic liver. HAs presented as a heterogeneous group, with loss of PTEN observed in the inflammatory and HNF1A-mutated subtype and relatively intact PTEN expression in HA with nuclear β-catenin overexpression. This suggests that the loss of PTEN might occur both in HA and HCC, constituting different outcomes of the same molecular lesion in the various contexts of malignant or benign neoplasms.
GALNT14 is a member of N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase enzyme family and mediates breast cancer cell development. Here, we find that GALNT14 regulates multidrug resistance (MDR) in breast cancer. The expression of GALNT14 is associated with MDR in breast cancer. Higher level of GALNT14 facilitates MCF-7 cells to resist Adriamycin, whereas knockdown of GALNT14 sensitizes cells to Adriamycin. Moreover, the expression of GALNT14 associates with the expression of P-gp, the efflux pump localized on the cell membrane, which could be the underlying mechanism of how GALNT14 induces MDR. In-depth analysis shows that GALNT14 regulates the stability of P-gp. Finally, GALNT14 associates with higher level of P-gp in chemotherapy-resistant human breast cancer tissues. Taken together, our studies reveal a molecular mechanism in breast cancer MDR.
GNE myopathy is an ultra-rare autosomal recessive disease, which starts as a distal muscle weakness and ultimately leads to a wheelchair bound state. Molecular research and animal modelling significantly moved forward understanding of GNE myopathy mechanisms and suggested therapeutic interventions to alleviate the symptoms. Multiple therapeutic attempts are being made to supplement sialic acid depleted in GNE myopathy muscle cells. Translational research field provided valuable knowledge through natural history studies, patient registries and clinical trial, which significantly contributed to bringing forward an era of GNE myopathy treatment. In this review, we are summarising current GNE myopathy, scientific trends and open questions, which would be of significant interest for a wide neuromuscular diseases community.
CYP2C19 genotypes presumably allow the prediction of the metabolizer phenotypes: poor (PMs), extensive (EMs) and ultra-rapid (UMs). However, evidence from previous studies regarding this predictive power is unclear, which is important because the benefits expected by healthcare institutions and patients are based on this premise. Therefore, we aimed to complete a formal evaluation of the diagnostic value of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 genes for predicting metabolizer phenotypes established by omeprazole (OME) administration in 118 healthy children from Jalisco (western Mexico).
PTEN loss has been associated with poorer prognosis in many solid tumors. However, such investigation in lymphomas is limited. In this study, PTEN cytoplasmic and nuclear expression, PTEN gene deletion, and PTEN mutations were evaluated in two independent cohorts of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Cytoplasmic PTEN expression was found in approximately 67% of total 747 DLBCL cases, more frequently in the activated B-cell-like subtype. Nuclear PTEN expression was less frequent and at lower levels, which significantly correlated with higher PTEN mRNA expression. Remarkably, loss of PTEN protein expression was associated with poorer survival only in DLBCL with AKT hyperactivation. In contrast, high PTEN expression was associated with Myc expression and poorer survival in cases without abnormal AKT activation. Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms for loss of PTEN expression were investigated. PTEN deletions (mostly heterozygous) were detected in 11.3% of DLBCL, and showed opposite prognostic effects in patients with AKT hyperactivation and in MYC rearranged DLBCL patients. PTEN mutations, detected in 10.6% of patients, were associated with upregulation of genes involved in central nervous system function, metabolism, and AKT/mTOR signaling regulation. Loss of PTEN cytoplasmic expression was also associated with TP53 mutations, higher PTEN-targeting microRNA expression, and lower PD-L1 expression. Remarkably, low PTEN mRNA expression was associated with down-regulation of a group of genes involved in immune responses and B-cell development/differentiation, and poorer survival in DLBCL independent of AKT activation. Collectively, multi-levels of PTEN abnormalities and dysregulation may play important roles in PTEN expression and loss, and that loss of PTEN tumor-suppressor function contributes to the poor survival of DLBCL patients with AKT hyperactivation.
SETDB1 is a histone H3K9 methyltransferase, which plays a significant role in the occurrence and progression of tumors. Previous studies have confirmed that T-lymphom invasion and metastasis gene (Tiam1) is a protein associated with the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, we have not yet been successful in elucidating the specific mechanism of HCC.
WHSC1 is a histone methyltransferase that is responsible for mono- and dimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 and has been implicated as a driver in a variety of hematological and solid tumors. Currently, there is a complete lack of validated chemical matter for this important drug discovery target. Herein we report on the first fully validated WHSC1 inhibitor, PTD2, a norleucine-containing peptide derived from the histone H4 sequence. This peptide exhibits micromolar affinity towards WHSC1 in biochemical and biophysical assays. Furthermore, a crystal structure was solved with the peptide in complex with SAM and the SET domain of WHSC1L1. This inhibitor is an important first step in creating potent, selective WHSC1 tool compounds for the purposes of understanding the complex biology in relation to human disease.
ST3GAL4 gene expression is altered in different cancer types, including cervical cancer. Several mRNA transcripts have been reported for this gene; however, their expression levels in cervical cancer have not been analyzed. ST3GAL4 encodes for β‑galactosidase α‑2,3‑sialyltransferase 4, involved in the biosynthesis of the tumour antigens sLe(x) and sulfo‑sLe(x). The present study evaluated the presence of three mRNA variants (V1, V2 and V3) in cervical cancer cell lines, detecting the three variants. Additionally, the expression level of the V1 transcript of the ST3GAL4 gene was determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction in cervical cell lines and in normal, premalignant and cervical cancer tissue. The V1 transcript of the ST3GAL4 demonstrated significant decreased expression in premalignant and malignant cervical tissues. The results suggested that deregulation of this gene could occur prior to the presence of cancer and demonstrated the importance of evaluating the expression level of V1, and its association with disease progression.
CYP2D6 codes for a protein that is vastly involved in the metabolism of various substances. This gene is highly polymorphic, which influences the enzymatic activity and contributes to the huge variability in the enzyme hydroxylation capacity. Different metabolic profiles determine the processing of xenobiotics and endobiotics, thereby influencing disease risk, therapeutic efficacy and side effects, or toxicity of xenobiotics. The aim of this work was to characterize CYP2D6 polymorphisms and predict metabolic profiles in the Portuguese population.
AK3 compounds are mitotic arrest agents that induce high levels of γH2AX during mitosis and apoptosis following release from arrest. We synthesized a potent AK3 derivative, AK306, that induced arrest and apoptosis of the HCT116 colon cancer cell line with an EC
ABO subtypes are characterized by the alteration of antigens present and their expression levels on red blood cells and many are linked to genetic changes in the ABO gene. Weakened expression of antigens should be identified to prevent transfusion reactions or ABO-incompatible transplantations. Genotyping can be applied to identify subtypes to complement serologic testing. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has shown to provide sensitive and accurate genotyping results as well as valuable cis/trans information. Here we took advantage of NGS and applied it to resolve serology discrepancies in ABO typing.
ABO blood group and body mass index (BMI) have individually been appraised as risk factors for certain diseases. From statistical perspective, it may be important to examine the relationship between the ABO blood antigen and BMI. This cross-sectional study involved 412 participants aged 18 to 46 at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi. Weight and height of participants were measured for BMI calculation; blood group determination was done using antisera. Blood group O was the most prevalent (51.2%), while Rhesus-positive individuals constituted 90.3%. 6.3% of the participants were obese, while 18.7% were overweight. There was significant (
ATP6V1H encodes subunit H of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) and may regulate osteoclastic function. The deficiency of ATP6V1H caused bone loss in human, mouse and zebrafish. In this report, we identified the mechanisms by which ATP6V1H regulates proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). We found that ATP6V1H was expressed in BMSCs, and Atp6v1h
CYP2C9 is the major human enzyme of the cytochrome P450 2C subfamily and metabolizes approximately 10% of all therapeutically relevant drugs. Two inherited SNPs termed CYP2C9*2 (Arg144Cys) and *3 (Ile359Leu) are known to affect catalytic function. Numerous rare or functionally silent polymorphisms have been identified. About 35% of the Caucasian population carries at least one *2 or *3 allele. CYP2C9 metabolizes several oral hypoglycemics, oral anticoagulants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other drugs, including phenytoin, losartan, fluvastatin, and torsemide. In vitro studies with several drugs indicate that the Cys144 (.2) and Leu359 (.3) variants confer only about 70 and 10% of the intrinsic clearance of the wild-type protein (.1), respectively. The clinical pharmacokinetic implications of these polymorphisms vary depending on the enzymes contribution to total oral clearance. Several studies demonstrated that the CYP2C9 polymorphisms are medically important for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for oral hypoglycemics, vitamin K antagonistic oral anticoagulants, and phenytoin. In particular, CYP2C9 polymorphisms should be routinely considered in therapy with oral anticoagulants where severe adverse events at initiation of therapy might be reduced by genotyping. CYP2C9 polymorphisms were also clinically associated with side effects of phenytoin, with gastric bleeding during therapy with non-steroidals and with hypoglycemia under oral hypoglycemic drugs. Data appear mature enough for the routine consideration of CYP2C9 genotypes in therapy with acenocoumarol, phenytoin, warfarin, and some other drugs. Nevertheless, it is advisable before the routine clinical use of these genotype data to rigorously test the benefits of genotype-based therapeutic recommendations by randomized controlled clinical trials.
HSD3B2 plays a crucial role in steroid hormone biosynthesis and is thus of particular interest in hormone dependent tumors such as prostate cancer. To clarify the clinical relevance of HSD3B2 expression in prostate cancer, we analyzed HSD3B2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry on our preexisting tissue microarray with 12.247 annotated cancers. Compared with normal tissue cytoplasmic HSD3B2 staining was stronger in prostate cancers. In 9371 interpretable cancers, HSD3B2 expression was found in 95.5% of cancers and was considered weak in 29.9%, moderate in 40.7% and strong in 24.9%. HSD3B2 up regulation was linked to advanced pathological tumor stage (pT), high Gleason grade, elevated preoperative PSA levels (p < 0.0001 each), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0019), accelerated cell proliferation (p < 0.0001), androgen receptor (AR) expression (p < 0.0001), and early biochemical recurrence (p < 0.0001). HSD3B2 up regulation was only marginally more frequent in ERG positive (98%) than in ERG negative cancers (94%; p < 0.0001) and was strongly linked to deletions of 5q and 6q (p < 0.0001 each). Multivariate analyses showed that the prognostic impact of HSD3B2 expression was independent of established preoperative, but not of postoperative prognostic parameters. In summary, the results of our study demonstrate that HSD3B2 is strongly up regulated in a fraction of prostate cancers that are characterized by increased AR signaling, adverse tumor phenotype and early biochemical recurrence.
ABO blood group genotyping is a new technology in hematology that helps prevent adverse transfusion reactions in patients. Identification of antigens on the surface of red blood cells is based on serology; however, genotyping employs a different strategy and is aimed directly at genes that determine the surface proteins. ABO blood group genotyping by real-time PCR has several crucial advantages over other PCR-based techniques, such as high rapidity and reliability of analysis. The purpose of this study was to examine nucleotide substitutions differences by blood types using a PCR-based method on Kazakh blood donors.
CLC channels mediate passive Cl
SETD2 is a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes the trimethylation of lysine 36 on histone 3. SETD2 is frequently found to be mutated or deleted in a variety of human tumors, whereas the role of SETD2 in oncogenesis of osteosarcoma has never been defined. Here in our study, we uncovered that SETD2 regulates tumor growth and chemosensitivity of osteosarcoma. Overexpression of SETD2 significantly inhibited osteosarcoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, SETD2 significantly enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells and inhibited cancer stem cell properties in OS cells. SETD2 regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling and its downstream gene c-myc, CD133 and cyclin D1. We further revealed that SETD2 upregulates H3K36me3 modification in GSK3B loci and promotes its transcription, which lead to β-catenin degradation. Together, our study delineates SETD2 function in osteosarcoma as an important regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and suggests SETD2 as a novel target in diagnosis and combined chemotherapy of osteosarcoma.
PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), also known as PARK6, is causally linked to familial Parkinsonism, and heterozygous loss of PINK1 is a risk factor for sporadic Parkinson's disease. However, little is known about its physiological function. Its deficiency was shown to decrease dopamine without significant loss of dopaminergic neurons. We investigated the mechanistic basis for this observation in the present study using dopaminergic MN9D cells. We found that PINK1 knockdown resulted in dopamine content to decrease with suppressed tyrosine hydroxylase expression in cells. Conversely, PINK1 overexpression increased tyrosine hydroxylase protein level. We also found that PINK1 deficiency blocked the nuclear translocation and activity of nuclear receptor-related 1, a transcription factor regulating tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression. These data suggest that PINK1 regulates tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression and dopamine content by modulating the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptor-related 1. Taken together, our results reveal a novel function of PINK1 in dopamine homeostasis.
CLC anion transporters are found in all phyla and form a gene family of eight members in mammals. Two CLC proteins, each of which completely contains an ion translocation parthway, assemble to homo- or heteromeric dimers that sometimes require accessory β-subunits for function. CLC proteins come in two flavors: anion channels and anion/proton exchangers. Structures of these two CLC protein classes are surprisingly similar. Extensive structure-function analysis identified residues involved in ion permeation, anion-proton coupling and gating and led to attractive biophysical models. In mammals, ClC-1, -2, -Ka/-Kb are plasma membrane Cl
PTPRQ gene, encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor Q, is essential for the normal maturation and function of hair bundle in the cochlea. Its mutations can cause the defects of stereocilia in hair cell, which lead to nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. Using next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing method, we identified a novel compound heterozygous missense mutation, c.4472C>T p.T1491M (maternal allele) and c.1973T>C p.V658A (paternal allele), in PTPRQ gene. The two mutations are the first reported to be the cause of recessively inherited sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing loss levels and progression involved by PTPRQ mutations among the existing cases seem to be varied, and the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes is unclear. Our data here further prove the important role of PTPRQ in auditory function and provide more information for the further mechanism research of PTPRQ-related hearing loss.
DUOX1 is an H
ACE inhibitory dipeptides from 
GALT is an important antigen of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), which was shown to provide partial protection against APP infection in a previous study in our lab. The main purpose of the present study is to investigate GALT induced cross-protection between different APP serotypes and elucidate key mechanisms of the immune response to GALT antigenic stimulation. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that galT is a highly conserved gene in APP, widely distributed across multiple pathogenic strains. Homologies between any two strains ranges from 78.9% to 100% regarding the galT locus. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed that GALT specific antibodies could not be induced by inactivated APP L20 or MS71 whole cell bacterin preparations. A recombinant fusion GALT protein derived from APP L20, however has proven to be an effective cross-protective antigen against APP sevorar 1 MS71 (50%, 4/8) and APP sevorar 5b L20 (75%, 6/8). Histopathological examinations have confirmed that recombinant GALT vaccinated animals showed less severe pathological signs in lung tissues than negative controls after APP challenge. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis indicated that the infiltration of neutrophils in the negative group is significantly increased compared with that in the normal control (P<0.001) and that in surviving animals is decreased compared to the negative group. Anti-GALT antibodies were shown to mediate phagocytosis of neutrophils. After interaction with anti-GALT antibodies, survival rate of APP challenged vaccinated animals was significantly reduced (P<0.001). This study demonstrated that GALT is an effective cross-protective antigen, which could be used as a potential vaccine candidate against multiple APP serotypes.
PTEN is a potent tumour suppressor, and its loss of function is frequently observed in both heritable and sporadic cancers. PTEN has phosphatase-dependent and phosphatase-independent (scaffold) activities in the cell and governs a variety of biological processes, including maintenance of genomic stability, cell survival, migration, proliferation and metabolism. Even a subtle decrease in PTEN levels and activity results in cancer susceptibility and favours tumour progression. Regulation of PTEN has therefore emerged as a subject of intense research in tumour biology. Recent discoveries, including the existence of distinct PTEN isoforms and the ability of PTEN to form dimers, have brought to light new modes of PTEN function and regulation. These milestone findings have in turn opened new therapeutic avenues for cancer prevention and treatment through restoration of PTEN tumour suppressor activity.
SETD7 is a histone H3K4 lysine methyltransferase involved in human gene regulation. Aberrant expression of SETD7 has been associated with various diseases, including cancer. Therefore, SETD7 is considered a good target for the development of new epigenetic drugs. To date, few selective small-molecule inhibitors have been reported that target SETD7, the most potent being (R)-PFI-2. Herein we report structure-activity relationship studies on (R)-PFI-2 and its analogues. A library of 29 structural analogues of (R)-PFI-2 was synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of recombinantly expressed human SETD7. The key interactions were found to be a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond formed between (R)-PFI-2's NH
KCNJ11 mutations cause permanent neonatal diabetes through pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium channel activation. 90% of patients successfully transfer from insulin to oral sulfonylureas with excellent initial glycaemic control; however, whether this control is maintained in the long term is unclear. Sulfonylurea failure is seen in about 44% of people with type 2 diabetes after 5 years of treatment. Therefore, we did a 10-year multicentre follow-up study of a large international cohort of patients with KCNJ11 permanent neonatal diabetes to address the key questions relating to long-term efficacy and safety of sulfonylureas in these patients.
CD36 scavenger receptor is expressed in a subpopulation of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). These neurons express canonical olfactory signaling machinery; however, not all odorant receptors (ORs) are coexpressed with CD36. In situ hybridization (ISH) enables the detection of nucleic acids in tissues, cells, or isolated chromosomes. The development of nonradioactive and stable labeling probes almost 30 years ago, allowed to routinely perform this technique employing different labeling strategies in one experiment. ISH is widely used in the field of neurobiology of the sense of smell, providing valuable neuroanatomical information regarding the molecular organization of the olfactory epithelium (OE). Here we show a method for studying CD36
GBA mutations are the most common known genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). Its biological pathway may be important in idiopathic PD, since activity of the enzyme encoded by GBA, glucocerebrosidase, is reduced even among PD patients without GBA mutations. This article describes the structure and function of GBA, reviews recent literature on the clinical phenotype of GBA PD, and suggests future directions for research, counseling, and treatment.
SOD1 is an abundant enzyme that has been studied as a regulator of the antioxidant defence system, and this enzyme is well known for catalyzing the dismutation of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide. However the SOD1 in the progress of NPC and underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
PIK3CA mutations are common activating mutations associated with breast cancer (occurring in 20-30% of all cases) and are potent predictive markers for responses to PI3K inhibitors. Thus, it is important to develop sensitive methods to detect these mutations. We established a novel detection method using a quenching probe (QP) system to identify PIK3CA mutations, using DNA from 309 breast cancer tissues. In a developmental cohort, we determined the optimal detection threshold of the QP system with human tumor DNA from 119 freshly frozen tumor samples. We found a 96% concordance rate with the QP system between DNA from 26 matching fresh-frozen specimens and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens from the same patients, and known PIK3CA mutation status in the developmental cohort. In a validation cohort, we evaluated whether the threshold for judging mutations using the QP system with frozen specimen-derived DNA was applicable with FFPE-derived DNA. In the validation cohort, 30 DNA samples from 190 FFPE-derived DNA samples with known PIK3CA mutation status were analyzed by direct sequencing (DS) and droplet digital PCR, in a blinded manner. The sensitivity and specificity of the droplet digital PCR results were 100% and 100% (QP system), and 60% and 100% (DS), respectively. We also analyzed the relationship between clinical outcomes and the PIK3CA mutational status of 309 breast cancer samples, including the developmental cohort and validation cohort samples. Multivariate analysis suggested that PIK3CA mutations, especially H1047R, were prognostic factors of relapse-free survival. Our novel detection system could be more useful than DS for detecting clinical PIK3CA mutations.
CD38 is a surface membrane antigen highly expressed in malignant blood cells, such as multiple myeloma (MM). A soluble form of CD38 (sCD38) is also present in the plasma, deriving likely from the shedding from the cells. The plasma levels of sCD38 should thus correlate closely with the proliferation of the MM cells, allowing the development of a simple diagnostic blood test for monitoring the progress of the disease. However, the plasma sCD38 levels are extremely low, requiring the design of a highly sensitive and specific assay.
ALAS2 gene mutations cause X-linked sideroblastic anemia. The presence of ring sideroblasts in a patient's bone marrow is the hallmark of sideroblastic anemia, but the precise mechanisms underlying sideroblast formation are largely unknown. Using a genome-editing system, a mutation was introduced in the erythroid-specific enhancer of the ALAS2 gene in HUDEP2 cells, which were derived from human umbilical stem cells and can produce erythrocytes. The established cell line, termed HA2low, expressed less ALAS2 mRNA than did wild-type cells, even after erythroid differentiation. Although the mRNA expression of α-globin, β-globin, and the mitochondrial iron importer mitoferrin-1 was induced similarly in wild-type and HA2low cells, hemoglobinization of differentiated cells was limited in HA2low cells compared with wild-type cells. Importantly, Prussian blue staining revealed that approximately one-third of differentiated HA2low cells exhibited intracellular iron deposition and these cells looked like ring sideroblasts. Electron microscopy confirmed that the mitochondria in HA2low cells contained high-density deposits that might contain iron. Ring sideroblastic cells appeared among HA2low cells only after differentiation, whereas the induced expression of mitochondrial ferritin was observed in both cell types during differentiation. These results suggest that the induction of mitochondrial ferritin expression might be essential for, but not the primary cause of, ring sideroblast formation. Our results also suggest that the insufficient supply of protoporphyrin IX due to ALAS2 deficiency in combination with increased iron import into mitochondria during erythroid differentiation results in the formation of ring sideroblasts. Furthermore, HA2low cells are a useful tool for characterizing ring sideroblasts in vitro.

CXXC5 is a newly identified CXXC-type zinc finger family protein, which is encoded by the 
ABCA1 is expressed in placental trophoblasts, such that when the expression level of ABCA1 changes, the function of trophoblasts dramatically changes. However, the mechanism by which ABCA1 affects the function of trophoblast cells remains unclear. Here, we used biochemical and transcriptomic to uncover the potential mechanism of the effect of ABCA1 on trophoblast function. HTR8/SVneo cells were either treated with the agonist T0901317 or transfected with siRNA to regulate ABCA1 expression levels. A human gene expression microarray was used to analyze the expression spectrum of ABCA1. Microarray results were confirmed by Western blotting and RT-PCR. Immunofluorescence allowed detection of the cellular localization of ABCA1, CCL8, CXCL10, CXCL11, and S1PR1 in HTR8/SVneo cells. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to test interactions among these proteins. Concomitant with an increase in ABCA1 expression, S1PR1 expression increased, whereas expression of CCL8, CXCL10, and CXCL11 decreased significantly; opposite effects were observed with a decrease in ABCA1 expression. Thus, changes in ABCA1 expression may lead to changes in downstream gene expression. Whereas the interaction between ABCA1 and S1PR1 was direct, interactions among ABCA1 and CCL8, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were indirect. We propose that, in conjunction with S1PR1, ABCA1 regulates expression levels of CCL8, CXCL10, and CXCL11; this may lead to changes in the immune function of trophoblastic cells. Thus, we suspect that the effect of ABCA1 on trophoblast function may involve many biological processes, molecular function changes, and the activation of multiple signaling pathways.
"ABO blood group is the most important blood type system for transfusion medicine. A paper-based analytical device (PAD) for ABO blood typing has been proposed. The device was composed of Whatman No. 113 paper, an absorbent gel pad, and a 3D-printing cassette. The 3D-printing cassette contained two circular holes for display of letters ""A"" and ""B"" on the PAD. Whole blood was dropped onto hydrophilic letters A and B on the PAD, in which the anti-A and anti-B were pre-immobilized, respectively. An absorbent gel pad was used to adsorb excess blood sample and washing solution during the washing step. The particle size of agglutinated red blood cells (RBCs) could not be eluted out of the paper by the elution solution. In contrast, non-agglutinated RBCs were washed out by means of elution solution. The devices could be used for real blood samples in a wide range of hematocrit levels, 21-59%. Unknown blood group samples (n = 500) were identified by the developed device and the results were compared with the conventional method, revealing 100% accuracy. Because of its compact size with low-cost fabrication, the portable ABO blood typing device has great potential for point-of-care testing, particularly in developing countries."
LTA4H is a monozinc bifunctional enzyme which exhibits both aminopeptidase and epoxide hydrolase activities. Its dual functions in anti- and pro-inflammatory roles have attracted wide attention to the inhibitor design. In this work, we tried to construct Michaelis complexes of LTA4H with both a native peptide substrate and LTA4 molecule using combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations. First of all, the zinc ion is coordinated by H295, H299, and E318. For its aminopeptidase activity, similar to conventional peptidases, the fourth ligand to the zinc ion is suggested to be an active site water, which is further hydrogen bonded with a downstream glutamic acid, E296. For the epoxide hydrolase activity, the fourth ligand to the zinc ion is found to be an epoxy oxygen atom. The potential of mean force calculation indicates about an 8.5 kcal/mol activation barrier height for the ring-opening reaction, which will generate a metastable carbenium intermediate. Subsequent frontier molecular orbital analyses suggest that the next step would be the nucleophilic attacking reaction at the C12 atom by a water molecule activated by D375. Our simulations also analyzed functions of several important residues like R563, K565, E271, Y383, and Y378 in the binding of peptide and LTA4.
PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) has been found to be up-regulated, which promotes the proliferation and chemoresistance in lung cancer. Nevertheless, the role and detailed mechnisms of PINK1 in lung cancer have not been fully understood, which need to be further clarified. In this study, the resluts showed that silencing of PINK1 inhibited proliferation and blocked cell cycle of lung cancer cells. Furthermore, the apoptosis rate was enhanced by PINK1 suppression, as evidenced by increased protein levels of Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and decreased level of Bcl-2. The migration and invasion abilities were also restrained by PINK1 silencing. Silencing of PINK1 also resulted in oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Finally, suppression of PINK1 repressed the growth of xenograft tumor and induced apoptosis in tumor tissues in vivo. This study might lead to PINK1 kinase as a novel therapeutic target for lung cancer treatment.
SLC2A9 or Glut9 is a voltage sensitive urate transporter, mainly expressed in the kidneys, the liver, and the intestine. Human Glut9 loss-of-function mutations were identified in familial hypouricemia, and several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with lower serum urate, further indicating that Glut9 is a major determinant of serum uric acid level. To get insights in Glut9 transport characteristics, we systematically analyzed the function of known human Glut9 mutants using 
SMYD3 encodes histone lysine methyltransferase. The goal of our study was to investigate the association between SMYD3 methylation and colorectal cancer (CRC).
PTEN plays an important role in tumor suppression, and PTEN family members are involved in multiple biological processes in various subcellular locations. Here we report that PTENα, the first identified PTEN isoform, regulates mitophagy through promotion of PARK2 recruitment to damaged mitochondria. We show that PTENα-deficient mice exhibit accumulation of cardiac mitochondria with structural and functional abnormalities, and PTENα-deficient mouse hearts are more susceptible to injury induced by isoprenaline and ischemia-reperfusion. Mitochondrial clearance by mitophagy is also impaired in PTENα-deficient cardiomyocytes. In addition, we found PTENα physically interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase PRKN, which is an important mediator of mitophagy. PTENα binds PRKN through the membrane binding helix in its N-terminus, and promotes PRKN mitochondrial translocation through enhancing PRKN self-association in a phosphatase-independent manner. Loss of PTENα compromises mitochondrial translocation of PRKN and resultant mitophagy following mitochondrial depolarization. We propose that PTENα functions as a mitochondrial quality controller that maintains mitochondrial function and cardiac homeostasis.
ABO subgroups would be considered when discrepancies in ABO grouping occur. Serological methods including adsorption-elution test, salivary ABH inhibition test, and anti-A1 (lectin) saline method could be used. However, these serological methods are laboring and obscure. Therefore, reliable and affordable method to assess the ABO subgroups is of particular interest.
CD38 is a transmembrane exoenzyme that is associated with poor prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). High CD38 levels in CLL cells are linked to increased cell migration, but the molecular basis is unknown. CD38 produces nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate and adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose, both of which can act to increase intracellular Ca
ABO incompatibility and preformed antibodies against the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) are two impermissible barriers to a successful renal transplantation, especially in highly sensitized patient population. With the availability of effective desensitization regimens, good patient and graft outcomes have been reported. As transfusion medicine specialists we report our experience, where patient presented with dual histocompatibility barriers i.e. ABO incompatibility along with preformed donor-specific antibodies (DSA) and negative complement dependent lymphocytotoxicity (CDC) HLA crossmatch. The desensitization strategy followed for our patient included rituximab (375 mg/m
CD38 was first identified as a lymphocyte-specific antigen and then has been found to be widely expressed in a variety of cell types. The functions of CD38 are involved in numerous biological processes including immune responses. Here, we showed the downregulations of both TLR2 mRNA and protein in macrophages from CD38
PIK3CA is a frequently mutated gene in cancer, including about ~15 to 20% of colorectal cancers (CRC). PIK3CA mutations lead to activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which plays pivotal roles in tumorigenesis. Here, we investigated the mechanism of resistance of PIK3CA-mutant CRC cell lines to gedatolisib, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor. Out of a panel of 29 CRC cell lines, we identified 7 harboring one or more PIK3CA mutations; of these, 5 and 2 were found to be sensitive and resistant to gedatolisib, respectively. Both of the gedatolisib-resistant cell lines expressed high levels of active glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3β) and harbored the same frameshift mutation (c.465_466insC; H155fs*) in TCF7, which encodes a positive transcriptional regulator of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. Inhibition of GSK3β activity in gedatolisib-resistant cells by siRNA-mediated knockdown or treatment with a GSK3β-specific inhibitor effectively reduced the activity of molecules downstream of mTOR and also decreased signaling through the WNT/β-catenin pathway. Notably, GSK3β inhibition rendered the resistant cell lines sensitive to gedatolisib cytotoxicity, both in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model. Taken together, these data demonstrate that aberrant regulation of WNT/β-catenin signaling and active GSK3β induced by the TCF7 frameshift mutation cause resistance to the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor gedatolisib. Cotreatment with GSK3β inhibitors may be a strategy to overcome the resistance of PIK3CA- and TCF7-mutant CRC to PI3K/mTOR-targeted therapies.
ALDH1L1 is a folate-metabolizing enzyme abundant in liver and several other tissues. In human cancers and cell lines derived from malignant tumors, the ALDH1L1 gene is commonly silenced through the promoter methylation. It was suggested that ALDH1L1 limits proliferation capacity of the cell and thus functions as putative tumor suppressor. In contrast to cancer cells, mouse cell lines NIH3T3 and AML12 do express the ALDH1L1 protein. In the present study, we show that the levels of ALDH1L1 in these cell lines fluctuate throughout the cell cycle. During S-phase, ALDH1L1 is markedly down regulated at the protein level. As the cell cultures become confluent and cells experience increased contact inhibition, ALDH1L1 accumulates in the cells. In agreement with this finding, NIH3T3 cells arrested in G1/S-phase by a thymidine block completely lose the ALDH1L1 protein. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 prevents such loss in proliferating NIH3T3 cells, suggesting the proteasomal degradation of the ALDH1L1 protein. The co-localization of ALDH1L1 with proteasomes, demonstrated by confocal microscopy, supports this mechanism. We further show that ALDH1L1 interacts with the chaperone-dependent E3 ligase CHIP, which plays a key role in the ALDH1L1 ubiquitination and degradation. In NIH3T3 cells, silencing of CHIP by siRNA halts, while transient expression of CHIP promotes, the ALDH1L1 loss. The downregulation of ALDH1L1 is associated with the accumulation of the ALDH1L1 substrate 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, which is required for de novo purine biosynthesis, a key pathway activated in S-phase. Overall, our data indicate that CHIP-mediated proteasomal degradation of ALDH1L1 facilitates cellular proliferation.
PTEN prevents tumor genesis by antagonizing the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway through D3 site phosphatase activity toward PI(3,4)P
ABO blood type is an invariant factor. There is a link between ABO blood type and some malignancies, such as gastric, pancreatic, and skin cancer. The role of ABO blood type in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. We performed a meta-analysis to explore the relationship between ABO blood type and risk of HCC.
IDH1 plays a critical role in a number of metabolic processes and serves as a key source of cytosolic NADPH under conditions of cellular stress. However, few inhibitors of wild-type IDH1 have been reported. Here we present the discovery and biochemical characterization of two novel inhibitors of wild-type IDH1. In addition, we present the first ligand-bound crystallographic characterization of these novel small molecule IDH1 binding pockets. Importantly, the NADPH competitive α,β-unsaturated enone 1 makes a unique covalent linkage through active site H315. As few small molecules have been shown to covalently react with histidine residues, these data support the potential utility of an underutilized strategy for reversible covalent small molecule design.
MDH2 (malate dehydrogenase 2) has recently been proposed as a novel potential pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL) susceptibility gene, but its role in the disease has not been addressed. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MDH2 pathogenic variants among PPGL patients and determine the associated phenotype.
ABO blood group-incompatible kidney transplantation is considered a safe procedure, with noninferior outcomes in large cohort studies. Its contribution to living kidney transplantation programs is substantial and growing. Outcomes compared with center-matched ABO blood group-compatible control patients have not been ascertained.
CYP2C19 genotype influences clopidogrel response but only accounts for a small part of the variability in platelet reactivity. Recently, exome sequencing identified a variant of the gene encoding B4GALT2 as a potential candidate implicated in on-treatment platelet reactivity. Carriers of the B4GALT2 c.909C>T variant have lower platelet reactivity indicating that B4GALT2 could influence clopidogrel sensitivity and could expose to the risk of bleeding events. We undertook this observational retrospective study to determine if B4GALT2 c.909C>T influences P2RY12-specific vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation and agonist-induced platelet aggregation in a nonselected cohort of 174 patients under clopidogrel-based antiplatelet therapy. Our results indicate that in individuals under dual antiplatelet therapy, B4GALT2 c.909C>T might be an independent genetic predictor of on-treatment platelet reactivity.
RPE cell transplantation as a potential treatment for AMD has been extensively investigated; however, in AMD, ultrastructural damage affects both the RPE and its underlying matrix support, the Bruch's membrane (BrM). An RPE monolayer supported by a surrogate scaffold could thus provide a more effective approach to cell-based therapy for AMD. Toward this goal, we aimed to establish a functional human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (hiPSC)-RPE monolayer on a Bombyx mori silk fibroin (BMSF) scaffold.
ABO incompatibility (ABOi), the most common cause of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), is nearly always mild and treatable with phototherapy. Reports of ABOi HDN requiring neonatal exchange transfusion are extremely rare since the inception of modern guidelines. Here, a case of ABOi HDN clearly met criteria for exchange transfusion. An O-positive African American mother delivered a B-positive neonate that quickly developed hyperbilirubinemia. The neonatal DAT was positive from anti-B and anti-A,B, and maternal IgG titer was 1024. Double volume exchange transfusion resulted in a favorable outcome. Given early discharge of newborns, further understanding of factors predicting severe disease is needed.
SLC26A3 (downregulated in adenoma; DRA) is a Cl-/anion exchanger expressed in the luminal membrane of intestinal epithelial cells, where it facilitates electroneutral NaCl absorption. SLC26A3 loss of function in humans or mice causes chloride-losing diarrhea. Here, we identified slc26a3 inhibitors in a screen of 50,000 synthetic small molecules done in Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells coexpressing slc26a3 and a genetically encoded halide sensor. Structure-activity relationship studies were done on the most potent inhibitor classes identified in the screen: 4,8-dimethylcoumarins and acetamide-thioimidazoles. The dimethylcoumarin DRAinh-A250 fully and reversibly inhibited slc26a3-mediated Cl- exchange with HCO3-, I-, and thiocyanate (SCN-), with an IC50 of ~0.2 μM. DRAinh-A250 did not inhibit the homologous anion exchangers slc26a4 (pendrin) or slc26a6 (PAT-1), nor did it alter activity of other related proteins or intestinal ion channels. In mice, intraluminal DRAinh-A250 blocked fluid absorption in closed colonic loops but not in jejunal loops, while the NHE3 (SLC9A3) inhibitor tenapanor blocked absorption only in the jejunum. Oral DRAinh-A250 and tenapanor comparably reduced signs of constipation in loperamide-treated mice, with additive effects found on coadministration. DRAinh-A250 was also effective in loperamide-treated cystic fibrosis mice. These studies support a major role of slc26a3 in colonic fluid absorption and suggest the therapeutic utility of SLC26A3 inhibition in constipation.
CYP24A1 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer, and the reason for the dysregulation of CYP24A1 in colorectal cancer is still unknown. In the present study, experiments were designed to test whether CYP24A1 inhibition facilitated the antiproliferative effect of 1,25(OH)
CD36 is a scavenger receptor, a type of membrane-bound receptors that characterized by recognizing a variety of ligands including endogenous proteins and pathogens. Here, we characterized CD36 gene in turbot, and its expression patterns in mucosal barriers following different bacterial infection, as well as microbial ligand binding ability and bacteriostatic activities. In current study, one SmCD36 gene was captured with a 1407 bp open reading frame (ORF). In multiple species comparison, SmCD36 showed the highest similarity and identity to Cynoglossus semilaevis. In the phylogenetic analysis, SmCD36 showed the closest relationship to C. semilaevis, followed by Takifugu rubripes. The genomic structure analysis showed that CD36 had 12 exons with almost the same length in vertebrate species, indicating the conservation of CD36 during evolution. The syntenic analysis revealed that CD36 located between GNAI1 and SEMA3C genes across all the selected species, which suggested the synteny encompassing CD36 region during vertebrate evolution. Subsequently, SmCD36 was expressed in all the examined turbot tissues, with the highest expression level in intestine. In addition, SmCD36 was significantly up-regulated in intestine following both Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio anguillarum, and Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus iniae immersion challenge. Finally, the rSmCD36 showed strong binding ability to all the examined microbial ligands and significant inhibition effect on Staphylococcus aureusrequires. Taken together, our results suggested SmCD36 involved in fish innate immune responses to bacterial infection. However, the knowledge of CD36 are still limited in teleost species, further studies should be carried out to better characterize its detailed roles in teleost mucosal immunity.
CYP2D6 plays a crucial role in drug metabolism of several drugs. It is known to be highly polymorphic with enzymatic activity ranging from poor to ultrarapid metabolic rates. While the frequencies of CYP2D6 alleles are generally known in different Asian populations, data on frequencies of the copy number variations (CNV) and tandems in CYP2D6 in which they occur are less well studied in these populations.
CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) morbidity is becoming an endemic worldwide. Recently, the role of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the development of atherosclerotic plaques has been explored, but the association of their genetic polymorphisms and CAD has yet not been established. The present study aimed to investigate the association of IL-8-251A/T (rs4073) and IL-10 -592C/A (rs1800872) polymorphisms and the risk of CAD in North Indian population. 1000 subjects (500 angiographically confirmed CAD patients and 500 controls) were genotyped by ARMS-PCR. Results revealed a significant risk association of both the polymorphisms with CAD. The heterozygous and the mutant genotypes of IL-8 rs4073 were both found to be associated with the risk of disease after adjusting for the confounders (p
G6PD deficiency presents a higher incidence rate in southern China. Many variants of G6PD resulted from point mutations in the G6PD gene, which lead to decrease of enzyme activity. The objective of this study was to analyze the genotype of G6PD deficiency in four regions of Guangdong province.
CD38 is expressed on Waldenström macroglobulinaemia (WM) cells, but its role as a therapeutic target remains undefined. With recent approval of the anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, daratumumab (Dara), we hypothesized that blocking CD38 would be lethal to WM cells. In vitro Dara treatment of WM cells (including ibrutinib-resistant lines) elicited antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis (ADCP) and direct apoptosis. In vivo, Dara treatment was well tolerated and delayed tumour growth in RPCI-WM1-xenografted mice. CD38 is reported to augment B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling; we noted that Dara significantly attenuated phosphorylated SYK, LYN, BTK, PLCγ2, ERK1/2, AKT, mTOR, and S6 levels, and this effect was augmented by cotreatment with ibrutinib. Indeed, WM cells, including ibrutinib-resistant WM cell lines treated with the ibrutinib + Dara combination, showed significantly more cell death through ADCC, CDC, ADCP and apoptosis relative to single-agent Dara or ibrutinib. In summary, we are the first to report the in vitro and in vivo anti-WM activity of Dara. Furthermore, we show a close connection between BCR and CD38 signalling, which can be co-targeted with ibrutinib + Dara to induce marked WM cell death, irrespective of acquired resistance to ibrutinib.
ST3GAL3 encodes the Golgi enzyme beta-galactoside-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase-III that in humans forms, among others, the sialyl Lewis a (sLe
CYP2C9 is a human microsomal cytochrome P450c (CYP). Much variation in CYP2C9 levels and activity can be attributed to polymorphisms of this gene. Wild-type CYP2C9 and ten mutants were co-expressed with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in Escherichia coli. The hydroxylase activities toward steroids were examined. CYP2C9.2, CYP2C9.3, CYP2C9.4, CYP2C9.16, CYP2C9.28, CYP2C9.48 and CYP2C9.52 had higher testosterone 6β-hydroxylation than CYP2C9.1. CYP2C9.4 showed higher progesterone 6β-hydroxylation activity than CYP2C9.1. CYP2C9.28 and CYP2C9.48 showed higher progesterone 11α-hydroxylation activity than CYP2C9.1. CYP2C9.48 showed higher progesterone 16α-hydroxylation activity than CYP2C9.1. CYP2C9.2, CYP2C9.3, CYP2C9.16 and CYP2C9.30 had higher estrone 16α-hydroxylation activity than CYP2C9.1. CYP2C9.3 had higher estrone 11α-hydroxylation activity than CYP2C9.1. CYP2C9.39 and CYP2C9.57 showed similar activities to CYP2C9.1. These results indicate that the substrate specificity of CYP2C9.39 and CYP2C9.57 was not changed, but CYP2C9.2, CYP2C9.3, CYP2C9.4, CYP2C9.16, CYP2C9.28, CYP2C9.30, CYP2C9.48 and CYP2C9.52 showed different hydroxylation activities toward steroids compared with CYP2C9.1.
DHFR from Pf is a known target for malaria. There is a continued effort for the design and development of the potent inhibitor for PfDHFR in the control of malaria. Therefore it is of interest to screen PfDHFR with the derivatives of Pyrimethamine. The results show that the compound CID 10476801 has lowest docked energy (-11.48 kcal/mol) with protein likely to be a drug candidate, probably inhibiting PfDHFR structure. Residues of PfDHFR protein involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds with compound CID 10476801 are confirmed to be ASP54. The findings provide new insights into development of potent chemotherapeutic drug for combating malaria.
CYP1A1 is thought to mediate carcinogenesis in oral, lung and epithelial cancers. In order to identify a CYP1A1 inhibitor from an edible plant, 394 natural products in the IIIM's natural product repository were screened, at 10 μM concentration, using CYP1A1-Sacchrosomes™ (
CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme involved in calcium signaling and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD
PTEN is a tumor suppressor found mutated in many cancers. From a synthetic lethality drug screen with PTEN-isogenic colorectal cancer cells, we found that mutant-PTEN cells were resistant to dual inhibitors of FLT3 and aurora kinase-A, including KW2449 and ENMD-2076. KW2449 significantly reduced the viability of wildtype-PTEN cells causing apoptosis, while little effect was observed in mutant-PTEN counterparts. Transcriptome profiling showed that members of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway were strongly changed in cells after KW2449 treatment, indicating a potential role of the pathway in drug resistance. We found that KW2449 caused a dose-dependent, biphasic induction of AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 in mutant-PTEN cells. Co-treatment with the inhibitors of its upstream signaling completely abolished the reactivation of AKT phosphorylation by KW2449 and reversed the drug resistant phenotype. These data suggest that reactivation of AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 is a key factor to confer drug resistant phenotype of mutant-PTEN cells to the dual inhibitors and that proper drug combinations that shut down AKT reactivation is necessary for the effective treatment of mutant-PTEN cancer with the dual inhibitors in clinical settings.
FADS1 gene encodes delta 5 desaturase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the metabolism of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Minor alleles of FADS1 locus polymorphisms are associated with reduced FADS1 expression and intra-hepatic fat accumulation. However, the relationship between FADS1 expression and pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk remains to be explored.
ESD is an endoscopic technique for en bloc resection of gastrointestinal lesions. ESD is a widely-used in Japan and throughout Asia, but not as prevalent in Europe or the US. The procedure is technically challenging and has higher adverse events (bleeding, perforation) compared to endoscopic mucosal resection. Inadequate training platforms and lack of established training curricula have restricted its wide acceptance in the US. Thus, we aim to develop a Virtual Endoluminal Surgery Simulator (VESS) for objective ESD training and assessment. In this work, we performed task and performance analysis of ESD surgeries.
PAH biodegradation in plant rhizosphere has been investigated in many studies, but the timescale of degradation and degrading bacteria activity was rarely considered. We explored the impact of plants on the temporal variability of PAH degradation, microbial abundance, activity, and bacterial community structure in a rhizotron experiment. A historically contaminated soil was spiked with PAHs, planted or not with alfalfa, over 22 days with sampling once a week. In both conditions, most of the spiked PAHs were dissipated during the first week, conducting to polar polycyclic aromatic compound production and to decreased richness and diversity of bacterial communities. We showed a rapid impact of the rhizosphere on PAH degradation via the increased activity of PAH-degrading bacteria. After 12 days, PAH degradation was significantly higher in the planted (100% degradation) than in unplanted (70%) soil. Gram-negative (Proteobacteria) PAH-dioxygenase genes and transcripts were higher in planted than unplanted soil and were correlated to the spiked PAH degradation. Conversely, Gram-positive (Actinobacteria) PAH-dioxygenase gene transcription was constant over time in both conditions. At 12 days, plant growth favored the activity of many Gammaproteobacteria (Pseudomonadaceae, Stenotrophomonas, and Acinetobacter) while in unplanted soil Alphaproteobacteria (Sphingomonadaceae, Sphingobium, and Magnetospirillum) and Actinobacteria (Iamia, Geodermatophilaceae, and Solirubrobacterales) were more active.
PTEN (Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) is a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in most human cancers. PTEN is a lipid and protein phosphatase that antagonizes PI3K/AKT pathway through lipid phosphatase activity at the plasma membrane. More recent studies showed that, in addition to the putative role of PTEN as a PI(3,4,5)P3 3-phosphatase, it is a PI(3,4)P2 3-phosphatase during stimulation of class I PI3K signaling pathway by growth factor. Although PTEN tumor suppressor function via it's lipid phosphatase activity occurs primarily in the plasma membrane, it can also be found in the nucleus, in cytoplasmic organelles and extracellular space. PTEN has also shown phosphatase independent functions in the nucleus. PTEN can exit from the cell through exosomal export or secretion and has a tumor suppressor function in adjacent cells. PTEN has a critical role in growth, the cell cycle, protein synthesis, survival, DNA repair and migration. Understanding the regulation of PTEN function, activity, stability, localization and its dysregulation outcomes and also the intracellular and extracellular role of PTEN and paracrine role of PTEN-L in tumor cells as an exogenous therapeutic agent can help to improve clinical conceptualization and treatment of cancer.
ABO compatibility restriction on solid organ transplantation limits organ availability. In an effort to increase organ availability, pediatric ABO-incompatible heart transplants (ABOiHT) are now performed with similar outcomes to ABO-compatible transplants. Transfusion support can be challenging and currently there are no standard guidelines for blood product support, ABO isohemagglutinin (IH) titer cutoffs for transplant eligibility, or therapeutic intervention for these patients. The study aim was to survey current blood bank and antibody reduction practices for pediatric ABOiHT in the United States and Canada.
CYP2E1 activity is measured in vitro and in vivo via hydroxylation of the Chlorzoxazone (CHZ) producing the 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone (OH-CHZ) further metabolized as a glucuronide excreted in urine. Thus, the quantification of the OH-CHZ following enzymatic hydrolysis of CHZ-derived glucuronide appears to be a reliable assay to measure the CYP2E1 activity without direct detection of this glucuronide. However, OH-CHZ hydrolyzed from urinary glucuronide accounts for less than 80% of the CHZ administrated dose in humans leading to postulate the production of other unidentified metabolites. Moreover, the Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) involved in the hepatic glucuronidation of OH-CHZ has not yet been identified. In this study, we used recombinant HepG2 cells expressing CYP2E1, metabolically competent HepaRG cells, primary hepatocytes and precision-cut human liver slices to identify metabolites of CHZ (300 μM) by high pressure liquid chromatography-UV and liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses. Herein, we report the detection of the CHZ-O-glucuronide (CHZ-O-Glc) derived from OH-CHZ in culture media but also in mouse and human urine and we identified a novel CHZ metabolite, the CHZ-N-glucuronide (CHZ-N-Glc), which is resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis and produced independently of CHZ hydroxylation by CYP2E1. Moreover, we demonstrate that UGT1A1, 1A6 and 1A9 proteins catalyze the synthesis of CHZ-O-Glc while CHZ-N-Glc is produced by UGT1A9 specifically. Together, we demonstrated that hydrolysis of CHZ-O-Glc is required to reliably quantify CYP2E1 activity because of the rapid transformation of OH-CHZ into CHZ-O-Glc and identified the CHZ-N-Glc produced independently of the CYP2E1 activity. Our results also raise the questions of the contribution of CHZ-N-Glc in the overall CHZ metabolism and of the quantification of CHZ glucuronides in vitro and in vivo for measuring UGT1A activities.
CFTR (ABCC7) is a phospho-regulated chloride channel that is found in the apical membranes of epithelial cells, is gated by ATP and the activity of the protein is crucial in the homeostasis of the extracellular liquid layer in many organs [
CFTR modulators are a class of drugs which directly target the defective CFTR protein in cystic fibrosis (CF), improving its function with resultant clinical improvements. Currently these drugs are confined to people with a limited selection of genetic mutations. New modulators are in development which will lead to the majority of patients with CF becoming eligible for treatment. CFTR modulators are currently considered contraindicated in patients with a solid organ transplant. This excludes many patients who may benefit from the multisystem effects of CFTR modulator treatment. In this review, we discuss issues regarding drug interactions, organ transplantation and CFTR modulation.
GNE myopathy is a rare, recessively inherited, early adult-onset myopathy, characterized by distal and proximal muscle degeneration which often spares the quadriceps. It is caused by mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase gene (GNE). This study aimed to identify the disease-causing mutation in a three-generation Han-Chinese family with members who have been diagnosed with myopathy. A homozygous missense mutation, c.1627G>A (p.V543M) in the GNE gene co-segregates with the myopathy present in this family. A GNE myopathy diagnosis is evidenced by characteristic clinical manifestations, rimmed vacuoles in muscle biopsies and the presence of biallelic GNE mutations. This finding broadens the GNE gene mutation spectrum and extends the GNE myopathy phenotype spectrum.
CYP3A5 genotype is a major determinant of tacrolimus clearance, and has been shown to affect systemic tacrolimus metabolite/parent ratios in healthy volunteers, which may have implications for efficacy and toxicity. In a cohort of 50 renal transplant recipients who underwent quantification of CYP3A4 activity using the oral midazolam drug probe, we confirmed that CYP3A5 genotype is the single most important determinant of tacrolimus metabolite/parent ratio [CYP3A5 expressors displayed 2.7- and 2-fold higher relative exposure to 13-desmethyltacrolimus (DMT) and 31-DMT, respectively; 
ABCA4 is one of the main genes which mutations are associated with various inherited retinal diseases (IRD) such as Stargardt disease, cone dystrophy, cone-rod dystrophy, and retinitis pigmentosa. Wide prevalence of IRD, high heterogeneity of ABCA4 gene mutations that lead to impaired function of the protein with varying expressiveness make studying of the clinical and genetic characteristics of retinal diseases relevant for further investigations into pathogenesis, prognosis and outcome of the disease. This article reviews the literature on incidence of IRD caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene and characteristics of the clinical progression of retinal diseases associated with various types of mutations, and presents analysis of clinical and genetic correlations in terms of the effect the mutation has on the structure or function of the protein.
GNE myopathy is a rare recessive myopathy caused by mutations in the GNE gene. It is mainly a distal myopathy with relative sparing of the quadriceps muscle.
PIK3CA is one of the most commonly mutated genes in solid cancers. PIK3CA mutations are also found in benign overgrowth syndromes, collectively known as PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). As in cancer, PIK3CA mutations in PROS arise postzygotically, but unlike in cancer, these mutations arise during embryonic development, with their timing and location critically influencing the resulting disease phenotype. Recent evidence indicates that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitors undergoing trials in cancer can provide a therapy for PROS. Conversely, PROS highlights gaps in our understanding of PI3K's role during embryogenesis and in cancer development. Here, we summarize current knowledge of PROS, evaluate challenges and strategies for disease modeling, and consider the implications of PROS as a paradigm for understanding activating PIK3CA mutations in human development and cancer.
"IDH2 R172 mutations occur in >80% sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas (""SNUC"") and ~80% of these are R172S and R172T variants. We examined the utility of the monoclonal antibody 11C8B1 to IDH2 R172S in IDH2 R172-mutated tumors to establish an immunohistochemistry protocol as a surrogate method for IDH2 R172S mutation detection. Eighty-eight formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumors including 42 sinonasal tumors and a variety of IDH1/2-mutated malignancies were tested by immunohistochemistry. The IDH1/2 mutation status was determined in 86 cases by a targeted massively parallel sequencing MSK-IMPACT"
CFTR variant is the main genetic contributor to congenital (unilateral/bilateral) absence of the vas deferens (CAVD/CUAVD/CBAVD). We performed a systematic review to elucidate the genetic link between CFTR variants, CUAVD, and the associated risk of renal abnormality (RA).
CYP3A4 is a major enzyme catalyzing the metabolism of endogenous steroids that play an important role in the etiology of carcinogenesis. This study was designed to investigate the contribution of CYP3A4 polymorphism to breast cancer in Chinese Han female population.
CD36 is a cholesterol receptor involved in the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and development of atherosclerotic plaques. Cross-sectional studies have shown correlations between plasma CD36 and atherosclerosis but no prospective study has examined the association yet. We prospectively examined the association between plasma CD36 levels and risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) in a Danish population.
IDH1 mutations are common in low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas and cause overproduction of (R)-2HG. (R)-2HG modulates the activity of many enzymes, including some that are linked to transformation and some that are probably bystanders. Although prior work on (R)-2HG targets focused on 2OG-dependent dioxygenases, we found that (R)-2HG potently inhibits the 2OG-dependent transaminases BCAT1 and BCAT2, likely as a bystander effect, thereby decreasing glutamate levels and increasing dependence on glutaminase for the biosynthesis of glutamate and one of its products, glutathione. Inhibiting glutaminase specifically sensitized IDH mutant glioma cells to oxidative stress in vitro and to radiation in vitro and in vivo. These findings highlight the complementary roles for BCATs and glutaminase in glutamate biosynthesis, explain the sensitivity of IDH mutant cells to glutaminase inhibitors, and suggest a strategy for maximizing the effectiveness of such inhibitors against IDH mutant gliomas.
PNPLA2 gene mutations cause neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSD-M) or cardiomyopathies. The clinical phenotype, blood test results, imaging examination and gene analysis can be used to improve the understanding of NLSD-M, reduce the misdiagnosis rate and prevent physical disability and even premature death.
PTEN can suppress PI3K/AKT activity, and regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, and drug resistance. The previous study showed that up-regulation of miR-29a played an essential role in the occurrence of colorectal carcinoma. This study aimed to investigate the role and related mechanism of miR-29a in mediating Paclitaxel sensitivity of colorectal carcinoma cells.
ACMSD is a tryptophan metabolic key enzyme. HNF4α regulates the transcription of some energy-metabolic enzymes by cooperating with PGC1α, a major transcriptional co-regulator involved in energy metabolism. In this study, we investigated the involvement of PGC1α in Acmsd expression through cooperation with HNF4α. Luciferase reporter assay was performed in NIH3T3 cells using a reporter vector containing HNF4α responsive elements in the Acmsd 5' upstream transcriptional regulatory region together with HNF4α and/or PGC1α expression vectors. The Acmsd luciferase reporter activity was greatly elevated by co-overexpression of HNF4α and PGC1α in NIH3T3 cells. Moreover, the expression level of Acmsd mRNA was significantly increased by co-overexpression of HNF4α and PGC1α in primary hepatocytes compared with expression of either HNF4α or PGC1α alone. These results indicate that PGC1α is involved in Acmsd expression through cooperation with HNF4α.
FUT2 determines whether histo-blood group antigens are secreted at mucosal surfaces. Secretor status influences susceptibility to enteric viruses, potentially including oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). We performed a nested case-control study to determine the association between FUT2 genotype (single-nucleotide polymorphisms G428A, C302T, and A385T) and seroconversion among Indian infants who received a single dose of monovalent type 3 OPV. Secretor prevalence was 75% (89 of 118) in infants who seroconverted and 80% (97 of 122) in infants who did not seroconvert (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, .43-1.45). Our findings suggest that FUT2 genotype is not a key determinant of variation in OPV immunogenicity.
PNPLA3 and MTP genes have been associated with liver steatosis and chronic hepatitis C. We studied the influence of MTP and PNPLA3 polymorphisms in 114 Italian patients with chronic hepatitis C, evaluating the histological and clinical presentation of liver disease. The study confirmed the association of PNPLA3 polymorphisms with liver steatosis (p=0.041), but did not show any additive effect of MTP polymorphisms in the development of steatosis. MTP polymorphisms do not seem to influence PNPLA3 in the development of liver steatosis. Further studies with a larger number of patients are required.
OTC medications are generally considered safe and convenient to use without requiring a prescription. However, the safety of an OTC medication and the final health outcome depends in part upon consumers' perceptions, beliefs, and their decision-making about OTC medication use. This study uses a qualitative approach to explore the knowledge, beliefs, and practices associated with OTC medication use and decision-making in adults aged 65 years and older.
GCH1 encodes the enzyme guanosine triphospahte (GTP) cyclohydrolase 1, essential for dopamine synthesis in nigrostriatal cells, and rare mutations in GCH1 may lead to Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD). While GCH1 is implicated in genomewide association studies in Parkinson's disease (PD), only a few studies examined the role of rare GCH1 variants in PD, with conflicting results. In the present study, GCH1 and its 5' and 3' untranslated regions were sequenced in 1113 patients with PD and 1111 controls. To examine the association of rare GCH1 variants with PD, burden analysis was performed. Three rare GCH1 variants, which were previously reported to be pathogenic in DRD, were found in five patients with PD and not in controls (sequence Kernel association test, p = 0.024). A common haplotype, tagged by rs841, was associated with a reduced risk for PD (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.61-0.83, p = 1.24 × 10
CHAT has its limits. It is a three-hour exercise. However, the real world problems of healthcare rationing and priority-setting are too complex for a three-hour exercise. What is needed, as a supplement, are sustained processes of rational democratic deliberation that can address the challenges to healthcare justice posed by costly emerging medical technologies, such as these targeted cancer therapies.
LPL is a secreted enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides from circulating lipoproteins. Individuals lacking LPL suffer from severe hypertriglyceridemia, a risk factor for acute pancreatitis. One potential treatment is to administer recombinant LPL as a protein therapeutic. However, use of LPL as a protein therapeutic is limited because it is an unstable enzyme that is difficult to produce in large quantities. Furthermore, these considerations also limit structural and biochemical studies that are needed for large-scale drug discovery efforts. We demonstrate that the yield of purified LPL can be dramatically enhanced by coexpressing its maturation factor, LMF1, and by introducing novel mutations into the LPL sequence to render it resistant to proteolytic cleavage by furin. One of these mutations introduces a motif for addition of an 
GALT is a highly conserved antigen in gram-negative bacteria, and has been shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many zoonoses. 
COQ2 mutations cause a rare infantile multisystemic disease with heterogeneous clinical features. Promising results have been reported in response to Coenzyme Q10 treatment, especially for kidney involvement, but little is known about the long-term outcomes.
"GNE myopathy, previously known as hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), or Nonaka myopathy, is a rare autosomal recessive muscle disease characterized by progressive skeletal muscle atrophy. It has an estimated prevalence of 1 to 9:1,000,000. GNE myopathy is caused by mutations in the GNE gene which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of sialic acid biosynthesis. The pathophysiology of the disease is not entirely understood, but hyposialylation of muscle glycans is thought to play an essential role. The typical presentation is bilateral foot drop caused by weakness of the anterior tibialis muscles with onset in early adulthood. The disease slowly progresses over the next decades to involve skeletal muscles throughout the body, with relative sparing of the quadriceps until late stages of the disease. The diagnosis of GNE myopathy should be considered in young adults presenting with bilateral foot drop. Histopathologic findings on muscle biopsies include fiber size variation, atrophic fibers, lack of inflammation, and the characteristic ""rimmed"" vacuoles on modified Gomori trichome staining. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of pathogenic (mostly missense) mutations in both alleles of the GNE gene. Although there is no approved therapy for this disease, preclinical and clinical studies of several potential therapies are underway, including substrate replacement and gene therapy-based strategies. However, developing therapies for GNE myopathy is complicated by several factors, including the rare incidence of disease, limited preclinical models, lack of reliable biomarkers, and slow disease progression."
SUV39H2 (suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 2), which introduces H3K9me3 to induce transcriptional repression, has been reported to play critical roles in heterochromatin maintenance, DNA repair, and recently, carcinogenesis. Dysregulation of SUV39H2 expression has been observed in several types of cancers. However, neither the genomic landscape nor the clinical significance of SUV39H2 in lung adenocarcinoma has been probed comprehensively.
WWOX is one of the largest human genes spanning over 1.11 Mbp in length at chr16q23.1-q23.2 and containing FRA16D, the second most common chromosomal fragile site. FRA16D is a hot spot of genomic instability, prone to breakage and for causing germline and somatic copy number variations (CNVs). Consequentially WWOX is frequent target for deletions in cancer. Esophageal, stomach, colon, bladder, ovarian, and uterine cancers are those most commonly affected by WWOX deep focal deletions. WWOX deletions significantly correlate with various clinicopathological features in esophageal carcinoma. WWOX is also a common target for translocations in multiple myeloma. By mapping R-loop (RNA:DNA hybrid) forming sequences (RFLS) we observe this to be a consistent feature aligning with germline and somatic CNV break points at the edges and core of FRA16D spanning from introns 5 to 8 of WWOX. Germline CNV polymorphisms affecting WWOX are extremely common in humans across different ethnic groups. Importantly, structural variants datasets allowed us to identify a specific hot spot for germline duplications and deletions within intron 5 of WWOX coinciding with the 5' edge of the FRA16D core and various RFLS. Recently, multiple pathogenic CNVs spanning WWOX have been identified associated with neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, infantile epileptic encephalopathies, and other developmental anomalies. Loss of WWOX function has recently been associated with DNA damage repair abnormalities, increased genomic instability, and resistance to chemoradiotherapy. The described observations place WWOX both as a target of and a contributor to genomic instability. Both of these aspects will be discussed in this review.
CYP7A1 (cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis from cholesterol-a main pathway for cholesterol removal from the body. CYP7A1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with total cholesterol and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) levels, risk of cardiovascular diseases, and other phenotypes; however, results are inconsistent, and causative variants remain uncertain, except for a frequent promoter SNP (rs3808607).
ATP11A and ATP11C, members of the P4-ATPases, are flippases that translocate phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) from the outer to inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Using the W3 T lymphoma cell line, we found that Ca
GCNT3 is a member of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase family involved with mucin biosynthesis. GCNT3 aberrant expression is known to promote the progression of several human cancers. However, its role in tumorigenesis and the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been well-characterized. Our study investigated the functional mechanisms of GCNT3 regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) in NSCLC.
ENPP1 (Ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1), a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, hydrolyzes ATP to produce AMP and diphosphate, thereby inhibiting bone mineralization. A recent study showed that ENPP1 also preferentially hydrolyzes 2'3'-cGAMP (cyclic GMP-AMP) but not its linkage isomer 3'3'-cGAMP, and negatively regulates the cGAS-STING pathway in the innate immune system. Here, we present the high-resolution crystal structures of ENPP1 in complex with 3'3'-cGAMP and the reaction intermediate pA(3',5')pG. The structures revealed that the adenine and guanine bases of the dinucleotides are recognized by nucleotide- and guanine-pockets, respectively. Furthermore, the structures indicate that 2'3'-cGAMP, but not 3'3'-cGAMP, binds to the active site in a conformation suitable for catalysis, thereby explaining the specific degradation of 2'3'-cGAMP by ENPP1. Our findings provide insights into how ENPP1 hydrolyzes both ATP and cGAMP to participate in the two distinct biological processes.
ABO blood type A was reported to correlate with an increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in white patients with severe sepsis and major trauma compared with patients with other blood types. Information regarding ABO phenotypes and major outcomes in patients with ARDS is unavailable. The primary aim was to determine the relationship between ABO blood type A and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). The secondary aim was to describe the association between ABO blood type A and ICU length of stay (LOS) in this study population.
PNPLA3 variant rs738409 has been identified as important progression factor in patients with ALD and NAFLD, the most common liver diseases worldwide. These findings point towards similarities between metabolism of alcohol and fat with regard to the PNPLA3 gene. However, despite many efforts, neither the mechanisms of PNPLA3-related liver damage nor the physiological role of PNPLA3 are fully understood. Based on a large monocentric cohort of Caucasian heavy drinkers we could recently provide evidence that PNPLA3 GG primarily correlated with signs of liver damage (steatohepatitis, ballooning) but less with steatosis. Moreover, upon alcohol withdrawal, PNPLA3 GG carriers showed a delayed inflammation-associated resolution of liver stiffness. In line with the histological findings, hepatic fat content as quantified by CAP (controlled attenuation parameter) did not depend on PNPLA3 status and decreased equally in all genotypes by ca. 30 dB/m during alcohol withdrawal. Preliminary additional analysis from this large cohort indicates that PNPLA3 GG carriers (8.2%) drink significantly less high percentage beverages (23% vs 55%, p < 0.001) but show no metabolic phenotype such as increased weight, BMI or diabetes. On the molecular level, key molecules, important for lipolysis and flow of free fatty acids to the liver were drastically reduced in G carriers. These included the liver-synthesized serum ApoA1, the LD-associated protein perilipin5 and the recently identified hepato-protective transcriptional cofactor transducin beta-like-related 1 (TBLR1). Based on these findings, we here introduce the liver damage feedback hypothesis. Accordingly, PNPLA3-mediated liver damage (e.g. by enhanced metabolic activity) suppresses the mobilization of fat towards the liver at various levels (reduced serum lipid flux to the liver and fat mobilization from peripheric adipose tissues, suppressed hepatocyte fat release and avoidance of high percentage alcohol beverages). Finally, the liver damage feedback hypothesis identifies a novel and central role of liver damage on systemic fat homeostasis, which has not been appreciated so far.
CYP2J2 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. It had been described in different mammalian species; however, no studies have described this gene in Camelus dromedarius. CYP2J2 is an epoxygenase enzyme which oxidizes various fatty acids, mainly arachidonic acid, via NADPH-dependent epoxidation to generate epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). It is a multi-functional enzyme that plays crucial roles in inflammation, cancer, drug metabolism, and embryo development. It controls the water re-absorption in the kidney and maintains the blood pressure and glucose homeostasis. This study is considered the first report investigating the differential expression profiles of the CYP2J2 mRNA and protein in the liver, heart, and kidney of Camelus dromedarius. A total of 30 samples were used to determine the expression of both CYP2J2 mRNA and protein using qRT-PCR and western blotting methods, respectively. The mRNA level of CYP2J2 was significantly elevated in the liver compared to that in the heart and kidney. The tissue distribution of the CYP2J2 protein was coherent to its transcript level in the kidney, but not in the liver and heart samples. The difference between the CYP2J2 mRNA and protein distributions in the three studied organs may be attributed to the mechanism by which the CYP2J2 might be involved in the adaptability of the camel to the arid environment.
CYP2E1 is a mammalian cytochrome P450 enzyme, which oxidizes a structurally diverse class of endogenous and exogenous (xenobiotic) compounds. Best studied is the role of CYP2E1 in phase I metabolism of xenobiotics including alcohol. CYP2E1 metabolizes ethanol and is active in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent oxidative stress in the hepatic tissues. Several studies have shown and discussed the importance of CYP2E1 in the hepatotoxic actions of alcohol. However, the vast majority assessed the CYP2E1 activity only in isolated microsomes. Here, we aimed to develop and optimize a fast and easy method to assess alcohol-induced CYP2E1 activity in hepatocytes in vitro applying oxidation of para-nitrophenol to para-nitrocatechol as specific substrate probe. Using hepatoma cells with and without stable CYP2E1 expression and primary human hepatocytes, we established specific methodology to assess CYP2E1 catalytic activity and its induction by ethanol in a small number of cells and in a very short time.
SPR cytometry entails the measurement of parameters from intact cells using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon. Specific real-time and label-free binding of living cells to sensor surfaces has been made possible through the availability of SPR imaging (SPRi) instruments and researchers have started to explore its potential in the last decade. Here we will discuss the mechanisms of detection and additionally describe the problems and issues of mammalian cells in SPR biosensing, both from our own experience and with information from the literature. Finally, we build on the knowledge and applications that has already materialized in this field to give a forecast of some exciting applications for SPRi cytometry.
GNE myopathy is a rare autosomal recessive distal myopathy caused by mutations in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE), the bi-functional enzyme critical for sialic acid biosynthesis. In this study, we summarized the clinical features, pathological characteristics, and genetic profiles of 46 GNE patients. The clinical and mutational profile of 54 previously reported Chinese patients were also reviewed. A total of 21 novel mutations, including a gross deletion spanning exon 1-2 and a retrotransposon insertion were found in our cohort, enlarging the spectrum of GNE mutations. The most frequent mutation in Chinese population was D207V, which accounts for 25.5% of total alleles (51/200). The age of onset was much later in the patients carrying D207V compared to other patients, indicated the less deleterious effect of D207V on enzyme activity. GNE myopathy may be overlooked in China with a relatively milder phenotype due to the common mutation D207V.
ABO blood type is associated with cardiovascular diseases. Several studies have suggested sex-related differences in both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) clinical features and ABO blood type. However, few data are available regarding the relationship between ABO blood type and HCM clinical features. We aimed to analyze the relationship between ABO blood type and HCM clinical features, and the potential effects of sex on these relationship.
ABCG2 is a transporter protein of the ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) family that is expressed in the plasma membrane in cells of various tissues and tissue barriers, including the blood-brain, blood-testis and maternal-fetal barriers
ABO blood groups have been associated with venous thromboembolism and arterial thrombosis. Although platelets play key roles in thrombogenesis, the relation between ABO groups and platelets is not well known and was investigated in this study.
TNS2 is a focal adhesions protein and a binding partner for many proteins, including the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl. Although TNS2 can bind with Axl, the details of their interactions have not been elucidated. TNS2 is involved in IRS-1 signaling pathway. In this study, we confirmed the relationship between TNS2 expression and the expression of Axl, IRS-1, PDK1 and Glut4 in pancreatic cancer patients.
G6PD deficiency renders cells more susceptible to oxidative insults, while antioxidant dietary supplementation could restore redox balance and ameliorate exercise-induced oxidative stress. To examine the effects of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) supplementation on redox status indices in G6PD deficient individuals, eight male adults with G6PD deficiency (D) participated in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive ALA (600 mg/day) or placebo for 4 weeks separated by a 4-week washout period. Before and at the end of each treatment period, participants exercised following an exhaustive treadmill exercise protocol. Blood samples were obtained before (at rest), immediately after and 1h after exercise for later analysis of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), uric acid, bilirubin, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and protein carbonyls (PC). ALA resulted in significantly increased resting TAC and bilirubin concentrations. Moreover, TAC increased immediately and 1h after exercise following both treatment periods, whereas bilirubin increased immediately after and 1h after exercise following only ALA. No significant change in uric acid, TBARS or PC was observed at any time point. ALA supplementation for 4 weeks may enhance antioxidant status in G6PD individuals; however, it does not affect redox responses to acute exercise until exhaustion or exercise performance.
AKR1C3 is a promising therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Herein, an evaluation of in-house library discovered substituted pyranopyrazole as a novel scaffold for AKR1C3 inhibitors. Preliminary SAR exploration identified its derivative 19d as the most promising compound with an IC
RRM2B encodes the crucial p53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase small subunit 2 homolog (p53R2), which is required for DNA synthesis throughout the cell cycle. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a lethal mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Here we present the case of an infant with a novel homozygous p.Asn221Ser mutation in RRM2B who developed hypotonia, failure to thrive, sensorineural hearing loss, and severe metabolic lactic acidosis, ultimately progressing to death at 3 months of age. Through molecular modeling using the X-ray crystal structure of p53R2, we demonstrate that this mutation likely causes disruption of a highly conserved helix region of the protein by altering intramolecular interactions. This report expands our knowledge of potential pathogenic RRM2B mutations as well as our understanding of the molecular function of p53R2 and its role in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial DNA depletion.
CFTR modulators have revolutionized the treatment of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) by improving the function of existing protein. Unfortunately, almost half of the disease-causing variants in CFTR are predicted to introduce premature termination codons (PTC) thereby causing absence of full-length CFTR protein. We hypothesized that a subset of nonsense and frameshift variants in CFTR allow expression of truncated protein that might respond to FDA-approved CFTR modulators. To address this concept, we selected 26 PTC-generating variants from four regions of CFTR and determined their consequences on CFTR mRNA, protein and function using intron-containing minigenes expressed in 3 cell lines (HEK293, MDCK and CFBE41o-) and patient-derived conditionally reprogrammed primary nasal epithelial cells. The PTC-generating variants fell into five groups based on RNA and protein effects. Group A (reduced mRNA, immature (core glycosylated) protein, function <1% (n = 5)) and Group B (normal mRNA, immature protein, function <1% (n = 10)) variants were unresponsive to modulator treatment. However, Group C (normal mRNA, mature (fully glycosylated) protein, function >1% (n = 5)), Group D (reduced mRNA, mature protein, function >1% (n = 5)) and Group E (aberrant RNA splicing, mature protein, function > 1% (n = 1)) variants responded to modulators. Increasing mRNA level by inhibition of NMD led to a significant amplification of modulator effect upon a Group D variant while response of a Group A variant was unaltered. Our work shows that PTC-generating variants should not be generalized as genetic 'nulls' as some may allow generation of protein that can be targeted to achieve clinical benefit.
LBR (Lamin B Receptor) encodes a bifunctional protein important for cholesterol biosynthesis and heterochromatin organization on the inner nuclear membrane. Pathogenic variants in LBR are associated with marked phenotypic variability, ranging from the benign Pelger-Huët anomaly to lethal Greenberg Dysplasia. We performed trio exome sequencing (ES) on two patients with atypical variants of skeletal dysplasia and their unaffected parents. Patient 1 exhibited frontal bossing, mid-face hypoplasia, short stature with rhizomelic limb shortening, and relative macrocephaly at birth. Although remained short, Patient 1 later showed spontaneous improvement in her skeletal findings. Exome sequencing revealed two novel variants in LBR, c.1504C > G (p.Arg502Gly) in exon 12 and c.1748G > T (p.Arg583Leu) in exon 14, which were inherited from her unaffected father and mother, respectively. Sterol analysis revealed an increased level of cholesta‑8,14‑dien‑3β‑ol to 2.9% of total sterols, consistent with a functional deficiency of 3β‑hydroxysterol Δ14‑reductase. Patient 2 presented at birth with short stature and marked rhizomelic limb shortening but later exhibited decreasing severity of shortening of the long bones and improvement in the radiographic skeletal abnormalities although he continued to be significantly short at age 10 years. Exome sequencing revealed that Patient 2 is homozygous for a pathogenic variant c.1534C > T (p.Arg512Trp) in exon 12 of LBR, which was inherited from his unaffected consanguineous parents. This report provides further evidence for a phenotypic spectrum of LBR-associated disorders and expands the genotypic spectrum by describing 3 novel disease-causing variants that have not been previously associated with a disease. Moreover, our data on Patient 1 demonstrate that variants throughout the gene appear to influence both the sterol reductase and nuclear functions of LBR.
CYP46A1 is the cytochrome P450 enzyme that converts cholesterol to 24-hydroxycholesterol, a cholesterol elimination product and a potent liver X receptor (LXR) ligand. We conducted retinal characterizations of Cyp46a1
SLC35B4 belongs to the solute carrier 35 (SLC35) family whose best-characterized members display a nucleotide sugar transporting activity. Using an experimental model of HepG2 cells and indirect immunofluorescent staining, we verified that SLC35B4 was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We demonstrated that dilysine motif, especially lysine at position 329, is crucial for the ER localization of this protein in human cells and therefore one should use protein C-tagging with caution. To verify the importance of the protein in glycoconjugates synthesis, we generated SLC35B4-deficient HepG2 cell line using CRISPR-Cas9 approach. Our data showed that knock-out of the SLC35B4 gene does not affect major UDP-Xyl- and UDP-GlcNAc-dependent glycosylation pathways.
IDH1 mutation has been identified as an early genetic event driving low grade gliomas (LGGs) and it has been proven to exerts a powerful epigenetic effect. Cells containing IDH1 mutation are refractory to epigenetical reprogramming to iPSC induced by expression of Yamanaka transcription factors, a feature that we employed to study early genetic amplifications or deletions in gliomagenesis.
ABO blood groups have been suggested to have a high correlation with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). It has also been postulated that platelet indices, including mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW), are very important in the development and progression of CVDs. However, despite these common associations with CVDs, as far as we know, there are no studies investigating platelet indices in ABO blood groups. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether platelet indices are associated with ABO blood groups.
ABCG2 is one of a few human membrane transporters which display the amazing ability to transport multiple different chemicals out of cells. These multidrug pumps, which have orthologues in all organisms, are important in humans in the context of drug pharmacokinetics, especially with respect to resistance to chemotherapy. In 2016, we presented a mini-review on ABCG2 which identified many areas of exciting research progress as well as many areas of frustrating ignorance. Just 2 years on the field has advanced, particularly with respect to structural biology as the cryo-electron microscopy revolution has brought us new insights into the structure and mechanism of ABCG2. In this update, we evaluate the degree to which new data have enhanced our understanding of the structure and mechanism of ABCG2 and whether we are now in a position to translate some of these findings into inhibitor design and development.
CYP21A2 defects result in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired adrenal steroidogenesis. CYP21A2 lies within the major histocompatibility complex in an area of the genome highly susceptible to genetic variation. Alterations in the neighboring complement component 4 isotypes C4A and C4B have been associated with psychiatric and autoimmune disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate C4A and C4B in patients with CAH in relation to CYP21A2 genotype and psychiatric and autoimmune comorbidity. We determined the copy numbers of C4A and C4B in 145 patients with CAH (median age: 15.5 years, IQR: 16.8) and 108 carrier relatives (median age: 41.5 years, IQR: 12.0) and evaluated serum C4 concentrations. Comorbidity was determined by medical record review. Only 30% of subjects had the expected two copies each of the two C4 genes. C4B copy number determined total C4 copy number and serum C4 concentration, negatively correlated with carriership of a 30-kb deletion (P < 10
GNE myopathy is characterized by distal muscle weakness, and caused by recessive mutations in 
CXXC5 is a member of the CXXC-type zinc-finger protein family. Proteins in this family play a pivotal role in epigenetic regulation by binding to unmethylated CpG islands in gene promoters through their characteristic CXXC domain. CXXC5 is a short protein (322 amino acids in length) that does not have any catalytic domain, but is able to bind to DNA and act as a transcription factor and epigenetic factor through protein-protein interactions. Intriguingly, increasing evidence indicates that expression of the CXXC5 gene is controlled by multiple signaling pathways and a variety of transcription factors, positioning CXXC5 as an important signal integrator. In addition, CXXC5 is capable of regulating various signal transduction processes, including the TGF-β, Wnt and ATM-p53 pathways, thereby acting as a novel and crucial signaling coordinator. CXXC5 plays an important role in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis by regulating cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. In keeping with these functions, aberrant expression or altered activity of CXXC5 has been shown to be involved in several human diseases including tumourigenesis. This review summarizes the current understanding of CXXC5 as a transcription factor and signaling regulator and coordinator.
PIK3CA pathways are the most frequently mutated oncogenic pathway in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), including virally driven HNCs. PIK3CA is involved in the PI3K-PTEN-mTOR signalling pathway. PIK3CA has been implicated in HNSCC progression and PIK3CA mutations may serve as predictive biomarkers for therapy selection. Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) derived from necrotic and apoptotic tumour cells are thought to harbour tumour-specific genetic alterations. As such, the detection of PIK3CA alterations detected by ctDNA holds promise as a potential biomarker in HNSCC.
FUK encodes fucokinase, the only enzyme capable of converting L-fucose to fucose-1-phosphate, which will ultimately be used for synthesizing GDP-fucose, the donor substrate for all fucosyltransferases. Although it is essential for fucose salvage, this pathway is thought to make only a minor contribution to the total amount of GDP-fucose. A second pathway, the major de novo pathway, involves conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose. Here we describe two unrelated individuals who have pathogenic variants in FUK and who presented with severe developmental delays, encephalopathy, intractable seizures, and hypotonia. The first individual was compound heterozygous for c.667T>C (p.Ser223Pro) and c.2047C>T (p.Arg683Cys), and the second individual was homozygous for c.2980A>C (p.Lys994Gln). Skin fibroblasts from the first individual confirmed the variants as loss of function and showed significant decreases in total GDP-[
CD36 is one of the important transporters of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) in the myocardium. We previously reported that CD36-deficient patients demonstrate a marked reduction of myocardial uptake of LCFA, while myocardial glucose uptake shows a compensatory increase, and are often accompanied by cardiomyopathy. However, the molecular mechanisms and functional role of CD36 in the myocardium remain unknown.The current study aimed to explore the pathophysiological role of CD36 in the heart. Methods: Using wild type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice, we generated pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and analyzed cardiac functions by echocardiography. To assess cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, histological and molecular analyses and measurement of ATP concentration in mouse hearts were performed.By applying TAC, the survival rate was significantly lower in KO than that in WT mice. After TAC, KO mice showed significantly higher heart weight-to-tibial length ratio and larger cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes than those of WT. Although left ventricular (LV) wall thickness in the KO mice was similar to that in the WT mice, the KO mice showed a significant enlargement of LV cavity and reduced LV fractional shortening compared to the WT mice with TAC. A tendency for decreased myocardial ATP concentration was observed in the KO mice compared to the WT mice after TAC operation.These data suggest that the LCFA transporter CD36 is required for the maintenance of energy provision, systolic function, and myocardial structure.
CYP2D6 metabolizes ∼25% of all clinically used drugs, with numerous genetic polymorphisms affecting enzyme activity and drug response. Clinical utility of current CYP2D6 genotyping is partially compromised the unresolved complex haplotype structure of the CYP2D6 locus. We have identified a distal enhancer single-nucleotide polymorphism rs5758550 that robustly increases CYP2D6 expression, whereas rs16947 (CYP2D6*2), previously considered inert, reduces correct mRNA splicing and expression, thereby affecting presumed activity of other alleles on the *2 haplotype.
B4GALNT1 is an enzyme essential for the synthesis of complex gangliosides, whose absence leads to progressive neurodegeneration with aging in mice. Recently, eleven cases of hereditary spastic paraplegia with mutation in the coding region of B4GALNT1 were reported. However, changes in the enzymatic activity of their products have never been studied. We have constructed expression vectors for individual mutant cDNAs, and examined their activities by cell-free in vitro enzyme assays, and flow cytometry of cells transfected with their expression vectors. Among them, almost all mutant genes showed the complete loss of B4GALNT1 activity in both the in vitro enzyme assays and flow cytometry. Two mutants exceptionally showed weak activity. One of them, M4, had a mutation at amino acid 228 with a premature termination codon. Interestingly, the intensity of fluorescence of GM2 measured by flow cytometry was equivalent between the WT and M4 mutant, although the positive cell population was relatively small in M4. Western immunoblotting of cell lysates from transfectants with cDNA plasmids revealed 67-kDa bands except those containing premature termination codons or frame-shift mutation. Taken together with the clinical findings of patients, loss of enzyme activity may be responsible for the clinical features of hereditary spastic paraplegia, whereas the intensity of neurological disorders was relatively milder than expected. These clinical features of patients including those with male hypogonadism are very similar to the abnormal phenotypes detected in B4galnt1-deficient mice.
CD38 is overexpressed by multiple myeloma cells and has emerged as a target for therapeutic antibodies. Nanobodies are soluble single domain antibody fragments derived from the VHH variable domain of heavy chain antibodies naturally occurring in camelids. We previously identified distinct llama nanobodies that recognize three non-overlapping epitopes of the extracellular domain of CD38. Here, we fused these VHH domains to the hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains of human IgG1, yielding highly soluble chimeric llama/human heavy chain antibodies (hcAbs). We analyzed the capacity of these hcAbs to mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) to CD38-expressing human multiple myeloma and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. Combinations of two hcAbs that recognize distinct, non-overlapping epitopes of CD38 mediated potent CDC, in contrast to the hcAb monotherapy with only weak CDC capacity. Similarly, combining daratumumab with a hcAb that recognizes a non-overlapping epitope resulted in dramatically enhanced CDC. Further, introducing the E345R HexaBody mutation into the CH3 domain strongly enhanced the CDC potency of hcAbs to CD38-expressing cells. Exploiting their high solubility, we genetically fused two distinct nanobodies into heteromeric dimers via a flexible peptide linker and then fused these nanobody dimers to the hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains of human IgG1, yielding highly soluble, biparatopic hcAbs. These biparatopic hcAbs elicited CDC toward CD38-expressing myeloma cells more effectively than daratumumab. Our results underscore the advantage of nanobodies vs. pairs of VH and VL domains for constructing bispecific antibodies. Moreover, the CD38-specific biparatopic heavy chain antibodies described here represent potential new powerful therapeutics for treatment of multiple myeloma.
ABHD5 mutations cause Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome accompanied by ichthyosis. ω-O-Acylceramide (acylceramide) is essential for skin permeability barrier formation. Acylceramide production is impaired in Abhd5 knockout mice. The transacylase PNPLA1 catalyzes the final step of acylceramide production: transfer of linoleic acid in triglyceride to ω-hydroxyceramide.
SOD1 misfolding, toxic gain of function, and spread are proposed as a pathological basis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the nature of SOD1 toxicity has been difficult to elucidate. Uniquely in SOD1 proteins from humans and other primates, and rarely in other species, a tryptophan residue at position 32 (W32) is predicted to be solvent exposed and to participate in SOD1 misfolding. We hypothesized that W32 is influential in SOD1 acquiring toxicity, as it is known to be important in template-directed misfolding. We tested if W32 contributes to SOD1 cytotoxicity and if it is an appropriate drug target to ameliorate ALS-like neuromuscular deficits in a zebrafish model of motor neuron axon morphology and function (swimming). Embryos injected with human SOD1 variant with W32 substituted for a serine (SOD1
CFTR protein regulates electrolyte and fluid transport in almost all tissues with exocrine function, including male reproductive tract. Mutation of CFTR gene causes cystic fibrosis (CF), which affects the function of several organs, and impairs male fertility. The role of CFTR protein in different compartments of male reproductive tract (testis, epididymis, sperm) as well as an impact of CFTR mutation(s) on male fertility phenotype is discussed in relation with the choice of optimal technique for Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART) management.
MTHFR is a key enzyme in folate metabolism. Some genetic polymorphisms code for a less efficient enzyme, increasing serum concentrations of homocysteine. This has been associated with inadequate feto-maternal circulation and increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Paroxonase 1 (PON1) is a multifunctional enzyme that can detoxify homocysteine through its homocysteine thiolactonase activity. We evaluate the association between MTHFR 677 C>T polymorphisms and non-recurrent spontaneous abortion and its interaction with PON1 polymorphisms involved in homocysteine metabolism in women living in floricultural areas in Mexico. Sociodemographic, reproductive history, folic acid consumption during pregnancy and environmental exposure data of 264 women who had been pregnant sometime during the 10 years prior to study enrolment were collected. MTHFR 677 C>T, PON1 192Q>R and PON1 55L>M genotypes were determined by PCR amplification. Information on pregnancy outcome and maternal genotypes was obtained for 484 pregnancies: 34 non-recurrent spontaneous abortions (gestational age < 20 weeks) and 450 controls. GEE models were used to evaluate the association between MTHFR polymorphism and non-recurrent spontaneous abortion, and its interaction with PON1 polymorphisms. After adjusting for potential confounders, no significant association was found between the MTHFR 677 C>T maternal polymorphism and non-recurrent spontaneous abortion (OR

ABO dependent variation in von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII have an impact on hemostasis. Several contradictory studies have investigated the influence of ABO blood type in surgical hemorrhage. Emergency surgery is associated with an increased risk of perioperative hemorrhage leading to inferior clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate if patients with blood type O received more transfusions with blood components compared with non-O patients after major emergency abdominal surgery.
SMYD3 is a methylase previously linked to cancer cell invasion and migration. Here we show that SMYD3 favors TGFβ-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in mammary epithelial cells, promoting mesenchymal and EMT transcription factors expression. SMYD3 directly interacts with SMAD3 but it is unnecessary for SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Conversely, SMYD3 is indispensable for SMAD3 direct association to EMT genes regulatory regions. Accordingly, SMYD3 knockdown or its pharmacological blockade with the BCI121 inhibitor dramatically reduce TGFβ-induced SMAD3 association to the chromatin. Remarkably, BCI121 treatment attenuates mesenchymal genes transcription in the mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cell line and reduces their invasive ability in vivo, in a zebrafish xenograft model. In addition, clinical datasets analysis revealed that higher SMYD3 levels are linked to a less favorable prognosis in claudin-low breast cancers and to a reduced metastasis free survival in breast cancer patients. Overall, our data point at SMYD3 as a pivotal SMAD3 cofactor that promotes TGFβ-dependent mesenchymal gene expression and cell migration in breast cancer, and support SMYD3 as a promising pharmacological target for anti-cancer therapy.
GAPDH being a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway is one of the surface adhesins of many Gram-positive bacteria including Streptococcus agalactiae. This anchorless adhesin is known to bind to host plasminogen (PLG) and fibrinogen (Fg), which enhances the virulence and modulates the host immune system. The crystal structure of the recombinant GAPDH from S. agalactiae (SagGAPDH) was determined at 2.6 Å resolution by molecular replacement. The structure was found to be highly conserved with a typical NAD binding domain and a catalytic domain. In this paper, using biolayer interferometry studies, we report that the multifunctional SagGAPDH enzyme binds to a variety of host molecules such as PLG, Fg, laminin, transferrin and mucin with a K
CFTR mutations permitting residual function (RF) of the CFTR protein are disease-causing. These mutations are associated with a pneumopathy that is delayed in onset and is slower in progression than are more common forms of cystic fibrosis (CF), although the disease may become severe in some patients. RF mutations are among the most frequent in Italy, thus encouraging investigation of their prevalence and associated phenotypes.

CD38 antigen is highly and uniformly expressed on plasma cells and thus represents an ideal target for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Daratumumab is the most advanced anti-CD38 mAb in the clinical development with approval in several indications, nevertheless isatuximab that targets completely different epitope of CD38 molecule is also very promising drug. Anti-CD38 possess pleiotropic mechanism of action that have been described also in other mAbs, but quite specific, novel and very important seems to be the immunomodulatory effect provided by depletion of several CD38+ immunosuppressive immune cell populations. CD38-targeted mAbs induce partial response or better in approximately 30 % of heavily pre-treated myeloma patients as monotherapy. Based on their favourable toxicity profile and distinct mechanism of action, anti-CD38 mAbs represents very attractive partner to back-bone anti-myeloma drugs. Indeed, daratumumab is already approved as a part of three distinct combination regimens in relapsed setting. The combination of daratumumab with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is considered to be the best treatment option in relapsed myeloma with unprecedented prolongation of median PFS, including high rate of good quality responses. CD38 targeted therapy is rapidly moving toward the first line treatment. Anti-CD38 mAbs have been also successfully tested in other plasma cell dyscrasias (such as AL amyloidosis), and they are examined in other hematological malignancies (such as CLL, ALL, AML, etc.) and even in solid oncology as well as in autoimmune disorders. Implementation of CD38 targeted mAbs have been significant milestone in the treatment of MM, similar to that of CD20 targeted mAbs in CLL or non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We believe that this drug may eventually help to reach the cure at least in a subset of MM patients in the near future. Key words: acute myeloid leukemia - CD38 - daratumumab - isatuximab - multiple myeloma.
SLC7A5 is recognized as the major mediator of melphalan uptake into multiple myeloma (MM) cells; however, its contribution to the inter-patient variability of melphalan efficacy and toxicity is yet to be well elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the impact of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4240803 in SLC7A5 on the gene expression, ex vivo sensitivity to melphalan, and clinical outcomes in MM patients who were undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation with high-dose melphalan.
COMT rs4680 Val158 allele is associated with high MB-COMT protein expression and elevated activity compared to the Met158 allele in post-mortem brains. A meta-analysis study suggested the link between COMT SNPs and MDD risk; in addition, MB membrane-bound (MB-COMT) specific genetic variation was reported that influences predisposition to depression amongst females.
AQP7 and AQP9 represent glycerol channel in adipose tissue and liver and have been associated with metabolic diseases. We aimed to investigate the associations between genetic variants in 
PYCR1 is over-expressed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its high expression accelerates the progression of NSCLC. However, the underlying mechanisms of PYCR1 in NSCLC progression remain poorly understood. Our study determined the mechanisms of PYCR1 in promotion of the occurrence and development of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. Firstly, the expression patterns of PYCR1 in NSCLC tissues and cells were determined by RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Then, the effects of PYCR1 on cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by CCK-8 and flow cytomery assays. Finally, we explored the up-regulatory microRNAs (miRs) of PYCR1 and determined if MAPK pathway involved in this process. PYCR1 expression was elevated in NSCLC tissue samples and cells, and the high expression of PYCR1 closely associated with patients' advanced clinical process and poor outcome. Up-regulation of PYCR1 significantly increased the expression of p38 and promoted its nuclear accumulation. Besides, PYCR1 expression was negatively regulated by miR-488, and up-regulation of miR-488 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and tumorigenesis and increased cell apoptosis, and decreased p38 expression and its nuclear accumulation, whereas up-regulation of PYCR1 rescued these results induced by miR-488 over-expression. Collectively, these data suggest the mechanism of PYCR1 in promotion of NSCLC progression. PYCR1 is negatively regulated by miR-488 and then promotes the occurrence and development of NSCLC and activates p38 MAPK pathway.
PGD is a complication after heart transplantation (OHT) and a significant cause of mortality, particularly in infant recipients. Lack of standardized definition of PGD in the pediatric population makes the prevalence and magnitude of impact unclear.
SLC2A1 mutations cause glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome, whose phenotypic spectrum is a continuum, ranging from classic to variant phenotypes, the latter accounting for about 10% of cases. Very few SLC2A1-mutated patients with a spastic paraplegia phenotype have been reported so far, and they are associated with paroxysmal choreo-athetosis (i.e., DYT9). The authors describe two sporadic children with pure and complex hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) without paroxysmal non-epileptic movement disorders harboring heterozygous de novo SLC2A1 pathogenic variants. These patients have been identified by a targeted panel for HSP among 140 pediatric- and adult-onset unrelated cases with pure and complex HSP, thus indicating an overall prevalence of 1.4% of SLC2A1 mutations, which increases to 3% if only pediatric-onset patients are considered. The implications of these findings in the diagnostic work-up of HSP patients are discussed.
UGT1A4 is a major enzyme responsible for the glucuronidation of tamoxifen (TAM) and its metabolites. Genetic variations in the UGT1A4 gene could have a significant impact on the clinical efficacy of TAM. This study was performed to validate the association between UGT1A4 polymorphisms and the clinical outcomes for patients with breast cancer who received adjuvant TAM.
SLC13A3 encodes the plasma membrane Na
ABCB1 is one of the major drug efflux transporters that is known to cause multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy for the treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Inhibition of ABCB1 efflux function is important for maintaining the intracellular concentration of chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we evaluated ciprofloxacin for its ability to reverse MDR caused by the overexpression of ABCB1. Cytotoxicity of ciprofloxacin was determined by the MTT assay. The chemosensitizing effects of ciprofloxacin were determined in combination with ABCB1 substrates. The intracellular accumulation and efflux of ABCB1 substrates was measured by a scintillation counter, and protein expression was determined by the Western blotting. Vanadate-sensitive ATPase assay was performed to determine the effect of ciprofloxacin on the ATPase activity of ABCB1, and docking analysis was done to determine the interaction of ciprofloxacin with ABCB1. Ciprofloxacin significantly potentiated the cytotoxic effects of ABCB1 substrates in ABCB1-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, ciprofloxacin increased the intracellular accumulation and decreased the efflux of [³H]-paclitaxel without altering the expression of ABCB1. Ciprofloxacin stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCB1 in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings showed that ciprofloxacin potently inhibits the ABCB1 efflux function and it has potential to be developed as a combination anticancer therapy.
PTEN expression is lost in many cancers, and even small changes in PTEN activity affect susceptibility and prognosis in a range of highly aggressive malignancies, such as melanoma and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Loss of PTEN expression occurs via multiple mechanisms, including mutation, transcriptional repression and epigenetic silencing. Transcriptional repression of PTEN contributes to resistance to inhibitors used in the clinic, such as B-Raf inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma. We aimed to activate PTEN expression using the CRISPR system, specifically dead (d) Cas9 fused to the transactivator VP64-p65-Rta (VPR). dCas9-VPR was directed to the PTEN proximal promoter by single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), in cancer cells that exhibited low levels of PTEN expression. The dCas9-VPR system increased PTEN expression in melanoma and TNBC cell lines, without transcriptional regulation at predicted off-target sgRNA binding sites. PTEN activation significantly repressed downstream oncogenic pathways, including AKT, mTOR, and MAPK signaling. BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cells transduced with dCas9-VPR displayed reduced migration, as well as diminished colony formation in the presence of B-Raf inhibitors, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, and with combined PI3K/mTOR and B-Raf inhibition. CRISPR-mediated targeted activation of PTEN may provide an alternative therapeutic approach for highly aggressive cancers that are refractory to current treatments.
SLC26A3 (DRA) is an electroneutral Cl
PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases (PAH-RHDα) gene, a useful biomarker for PAH-degrading bacteria, has been widely used to examine PAH-degrading bacterial community in different contaminated sites. However, the distribution of PAH-RHDα genes in oilfield soils and mangrove sediments and their relationship with environmental factors still remain largely unclear. In this study, gene-targeted metagenomics was first used to investigate the diversity of PAH-degrading bacterial communities in oilfield soils and mangrove sediments. The results showed that higher diversity of PAH-degrading bacteria in the studied samples was revealed by gene-targeted metagenomics than traditional clone library analysis. Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Ralstonia, Polymorphum gilvum, Mycobacterium, Sciscionella marina, Rhodococcus, and potential new degraders were prevailed in the oilfield area. For mangrove sediments, novel PAH degraders and Mycobacterium were predominated. The spatial distribution of PAH-RHDα gene was dependent on geographical location and regulated by local environmental variables. PAH content played a key role in shaping PAH-degrading bacterial communities in the studied samples, which would enrich PAH-degrading bacterial population and decrease PAH-degrading bacterial diversity. This work brings a more comprehensive and some new insights into the distribution and biodegradation potential of PAH-degrading bacteria in soil and sediments ecosystems.
PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) is caused by inactivating germline PTEN mutations with subsequent activation of Akt-mTOR signaling, leading to an increased risk of developing thyroid carcinoma (TC). Activation of Akt-mTOR signaling is essential for innate immune cell activation and reprogramming of TC-induced macrophages. Here, we aim to assess the effect of PTEN mutations on innate immune cell function in PHTS patients, especially in the context of TC, using a unique ex vivo model. Monocyte-derived cytokine responses were assessed in 29 PHTS patients and 29 controls. To assess the functional profile of TC-induced-macrophages, a co-culture model with two TC cell lines was performed. Rapamycin, a lactate transport blocker and metformin were used as modulators of the Akt-mTOR pathway and cell metabolism. Monocytes from PHTS patients showed increased production of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8 and MCP-1, and higher lactate production. After co-culture with TC cell lines, TC-induced macrophages showed significantly increased production of cytokines in both patients and controls, especially after co-culture with a PTEN-deficient TC cell line; these effects were abolished after use of rapamycin or a lactate transport blocker. Metformin blocked the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, innate immune cells from PHTS patients have increased lactate production and a more proinflammatory phenotype, especially after co-culture with PTEN-deficient TC. Metformin promotes a proinflammatory phenotype by blocking anti-inflammatory cytokine response, whereas rapamycin reduces production of proinflammatory cytokines. This indicates that PHTS patients may benefit from treatment with mTOR blocking agents to limit the inflammatory response in the tumor microenvironment.
CYP2D6 bioactivates codeine and tramadol, with intermediate and poor metabolizers (IMs and PMs) expected to have impaired analgesia. This pragmatic proof-of-concept trial tested the effects of CYP2D6-guided opioid prescribing on pain control.
"ABO incompatibility and other alloantibodies have emerged as a significant cause of hemolytic disease of fetus and newborn (HDFN), leading to neonatal morbidity and mortality. We report three cases of severe ABO-HDFN where blood exchange transfusions (ETs) were required in neonates with hyperbilirubinemia. Blood grouping (ABO/RhD) was performed using conventional tube technique. The antibody screen was done using commercial three-cell panel (Bio-Rad ID-Diacell-I-II-III, Switzerland) by gel technique. Direct antiglobulin test (DAT) on neonatal sample and compatibility testing were also done by gel technique. Elution on DAT-positive sample was performed using ""heat elution"" method. All the three neonates were A RhD positive and were born to O RhD-positive mothers who were negative for antibody screen. Their DAT was positive (2+) and the elution of neonatal red cells yielded a positive reaction with A cells which was suggestive of anti-A antibody. The maternal anti-A (immunoglobulin G) antibody titers were high: 512 and 1024 (in two cases). The total serum bilirubin (mg/dl) of the three neonates was 22, 27, and 25 which came down significantly after they received ETs. Severe ABO-HDFN may occur in neonates born to mother with high titer ABO antibodies which can be effectively managed with ET."
CYP2A6 is a genetically polymorphic enzyme resulting in differential substrate metabolism and health behaviours. Current phenotyping probes for CYP2A6 exhibit limitations related to procurement (deuterated cotinine), toxicity (coumarin), specificity (caffeine) and age-appropriate administration (nicotine, NIC). In vitro, CYP2A6 selectively forms 2-hydroxymetronidazole (2HM) from metronidazole (MTZ). The purpose of this study was to evaluate MTZ as a CYP2A6 phenotyping probe drug in healthy adults against the well-established method of measuring trans-3-hydroxycotinine (3HC)/cotinine (COT).
SLCO1B1 T521>C variant carriers are susceptible to simvastatin-induced myopathy. We report a patient who developed rhabdomyolysis possibly triggered by a drug-drug and/or herb-drug interaction.
GALT deficiency is a rare genetic disorder of carbohydrate metabolism. Due to the decreased activity or absence of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT), cells from affected individuals are unable to metabolize galactose normally. Lactose consumption in the newborn period could potentially lead to a lethal disease process with multi-organ involvement. In contrast to the newborn-stage disease, however, a galactose-restricted diet does not prevent long-term complications such as central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction with speech defects, learning disability and neurological disease in addition to hypergonadotropic hypogonadism or primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) in females. As the literature suggests an association between GALT enzyme activity and the long-term complications, it is of importance to have a highly sensitive assay to quantify the GALT enzyme activity. To that end, we had developed a sensitive and accurate LC-MS/MS method to measure GALT enzyme activity. Its ability to predict outcome is the subject of this report.
ABCA4 is one of the main genes whose mutations are associated with various inherited retinal diseases (IRD) such as Stargardt disease, cone dystrophy, cone-rod dystrophy, and retinitis pigmentosa. The severity of retinal dystrophy phenotype may be related to the degree of mutation pathogenicity, which depends on the localization in various regulatory regions of the gene and the effect on the amino acid composition of the protein molecule. The article describes two clinical cases of patients with splice site mutations in the compound heterozygous state with missense mutations in the ABCA4 gene with various phenotypic manifestations, which demonstrate the importance of molecular genetic analysis in patients with IRD. Such analysis allows determination and accumulation of data on phenotype-genotype correlations that can help predict the disease course.
CYP24A1 plays important roles in antiproliferative effects, which have been proved in many human tumor cells. Polymorphisms in CYP24A1 may affect the risk of lung cancer, but the results remained inconclusive. To enhance the understanding of possible relationship between CYP24A1 polymorphism rs6068816 and lung cancer risks, we first carried out this case-control study among Chinese female nonsmokers, including 345 lung cancer patients and 351 noncancer controls. Our results revealed that individuals carrying CT and CC genotype were associated with decreasing lung cancer risk (adjusted odds ratios were 0.71 and 0.59, and 95% confidence intervals were 0.52-0.97 and 0.35-0.99, p-values were 0.031 and 0.048, respectively). Patients carrying allele-T showed lower hazard risks, especially in adenocarcinoma and advanced stage cancers. We also found that subjects with allele-T showed a relatively low risk of lung cancer when they were exposed to oil fume. But neither additive scale nor multiplicative scale revealed interactions between allele-T and environmental exposures, including oil fume, coal fuel fume, and passive smoking. Overall, these findings indicated that CYP24A1 polymorphism rs6068816 could be significantly associated with susceptibility of lung cancer in Chinese female nonsmokers.
PTEN is a lipid phosphatase that antagonizes the PI3K/AKT pathway and is recognized as a major dose-dependent tumor suppressor. The cellular mechanisms that control PTEN levels therefore offer potential routes to therapy, but these are as yet poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that PTEN plays an unexpected role in regulating its own stability through the transcriptional upregulation of the deubiquitinase USP11 by the PI3K/FOXO pathway, and further show that this feedforward mechanism is implicated in its tumor-suppressive role, as mice lacking Usp11 display increased susceptibility to PTEN-dependent tumor initiation, growth and metastasis. Notably, USP11 is downregulated in cancer patients, and correlates with PTEN expression and FOXO nuclear localization. Our findings therefore demonstrate that PTEN-PI3K-FOXO-USP11 constitute the regulatory feedforward loop that improves the stability and tumor suppressive activity of PTEN.
ABCC8 gene mutations with different inheritance patterns have been well described to cause transient and permanent forms of neonatal diabetes with onset of hyperglycemia commonly before the age of 6 months, and rare cases between 6 and 12 months. However, recent analyses have also demonstrated ABCC8 gene mutations in patients with monogenic diabetes (maturity onset diabetes of the young, MODY), with milder clinical phenotypes and later onset of hyperglycemia. We report two siblings with diabetes mellitus due to a novel homozygous p.(Phe1068Ile) (c.3202T>A) missense mutation of the ABCC8 gene, but significantly different phenotypes. The index case was diagnosed with diabetes due to an incidental finding of hyperglycemia at the age of 3 years, while her younger sibling presented with severe hyperglycemia and hyperosmolar dehydration at the age of 10 weeks. The possibility of a significant discordance in the correlation between genotype and phenotype needs to be taken into account when ABCC8 mutation dependent diabetes occurs within the same family. Genetic screening in children with diabetes from consanguineous family needs consideration, especially in case of negative autoantibodies and early onset of hyperglycemia.
PNPLA3 I148M variant and TM6SF2 E167K variant are recognized as the major genetic modifiers of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The present study sought to evaluate the potential additive effect of the two variants on the risk of NAFLD in Qingdao Han Population, China.

PDE5A is a phosphodiesterase which specifically hydrolyzes the cGMP to GMP. It takes part in several physiological and pathological pathways and is considered an important drug target. Currently, PDE5 inhibitors (ex; Sildenafil, Tadalafil) available in the market are not only being used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction but at the same time, they are also in clinical trials being investigated as anticancer agents.
UGT2B17 gene deletion (UGT2B17*2) has been reported to affect bone health as well as the pharmacokinetics of aromatase inhibitor (AI) drugs such as exemestane. The goal of this study was to assess associations between UGT2B17 gene deletion and bone health prior to and after 24 months of AI treatment in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer.
IDO1 induces immune suppression in T cells through l-tryptophan (Trp) depletion and kynurenine (Kyn) accumulation in the local tumor microenvironment, suppressing effector T cells and hyperactivating regulatory T cells (Treg). Navoximod is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of IDO1. This phase I study evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of navoximod in combination with atezolizumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, in patients with advanced cancer.
ACE (Active, Connected, Engaged) is a theory-informed, pragmatic intervention using peer volunteering support to promote active ageing in socially disengaged, inactive older adults. This study aimed to establish ACE's feasibility and acceptability.
SMPD1 (acid-sphingomyelinase) variants have been associated with Parkinson's disease in recent studies. The objective of this study was to further investigate the role of SMPD1 mutations in PD.
ABO blood group incompatibility between donor and recipient is associated with a number of immunohematological complications, but is not considered a major contraindication to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, available evidence from the literature seems to be conflicting as to the impact of incompatibility on overall survival, event-free survival, transplant-related mortality, graft-versus-host disease, and time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment.
ALDH1L1 (cytosolic 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase) is the enzyme in folate metabolism commonly downregulated in human cancers. One of the mechanisms of the enzyme downregulation is methylation of the promoter of the ALDH1L1 gene. Recent studies underscored ALDH1L1 as a candidate tumor suppressor and potential marker of aggressive cancers. In agreement with the ALDH1L1 loss in cancer, its re-expression leads to inhibition of proliferation and to apoptosis, but also affects migration and invasion of cancer cells through a specific folate-dependent mechanism involved in invasive phenotype. A growing body of literature evaluated the prognostic value of ALDH1L1 expression for cancer disease, the regulatory role of the enzyme in cellular proliferation, and associated metabolic and signaling cellular responses. Overall, there is a strong indication that the ALDH1L1 silencing provides metabolic advantage for tumor progression at a later stage when unlimited proliferation and enhanced motility become critical processes for the tumor expansion. Whether the ALDH1L1 loss is involved in tumor initiation is still an open question.
ENPP1 is well known for its role in regulating skeletal and soft tissue mineralization. It primarily exerts its function through the generation of pyrophosphate, a key inhibitor of hydroxyapatite formation. Several previous studies have suggested that ENPP1 also contributes to a range of human diseases including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and osteoarthritis. In this review, we summarize the pathological roles of ENPP1 in mineralization and these soft tissue disorders. We also discuss the underlying mechanisms through which ENPP1 exerts its pathological effects. A fuller understanding of the pathways through which ENPP1 acts may help to develop novel therapeutic strategies for these commonly diagnosed morbidities.
STS scholars studying anti-nuclear activism in the context of nations in the Global North have observed the critical role of science to mediate relations of domination and resistance. Through a historical examination of anti-nuclear activism in India, this article investigates the instrumentalization of science as a liberal democratic rationality. In doing so, the article shows how elite Indian activists - many of whom are scientists, engineers, journalists and academic professionals - will never be seen as scientifically knowledgeable in nuclear matters, because of their non-state educational pedigrees. If activists cannot hold the state accountable through science, they have attempted to anticipate what other kinds of arguments and modes of contention may gain traction. As such, they have deployed more 'guerilla' tactics grounded in bureaucratic rationalities in the hopes of installing themselves as alternate sources of expertise in India's nuclear landscape.
ITPA related epileptic encephalopathy (epileptic encephalopathy, early infantile, 35) is a rare inborn error of metabolism. All reported individuals with this condition, including the present case manifest global developmental delay, seizures, progressive postnatal microcephaly, hypotonia, thin corpus callosum, cerebral atrophy, delayed myelination and white matter changes in posterior limb of internal capsule. Cataract and dilated cardiomyopathy are other characteristic findings. Currently, a single publication describes this condition in four families. Three truncating and two missense variants in ITPA have been identified in these families. We hereby report another family with ITPA related disorder and review the genotype and phenotype of the reported subjects.
CYP2C19 isoenzyme of cytochrome P450 in the liver catabolises proton pump inhibitors, one of the therapeutics utilized in Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy, and in this way could influence the eradication effectiveness. The isoensyme contributes also to metabolism of endogenous substances, which derivatives are involved in the pathogenesis of peptic ulceration. CYP2C19*2 polymorphism (rs4244285) changing the CYP2C19 function could be relevant in the predisposition to peptic ulcer disease.
SLC35A2 transports UDP-galactose from the cytosol to the lumen of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum for glycosylation. Mutations in SLC35A2 induce a congenital disorder of glycosylation. Despite the biomedical relevance, mechanisms of transport via SLC35A2 and the impact of disease-associated mutations on activity are unclear. To address these issues, we generated a predicted structure of SLC35A2 and assayed for the effects of a set of structural and disease-associated mutations. Activity assays were performed using a rescue approach in ΔSLC35A2 cells and took advantage of the fact that SLC35A2 is required for expression of the glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), the cell surface receptor for Shiga toxin 1 (STx1) and 2 (STx2). The N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic loops of SLC35A2 were dispensable for activity, but two critical glycine (Gly-202 and Gly-214) and lysine (Lys-78 and Lys-297) residues in transmembrane segments were required. Residues corresponding to Gly-202 and Gly-214 in the related transporter SLC35A1 form a substrate-translocating channel, suggesting that a similar mechanism may be involved in SLC35A2. Among the eight disease-associated mutations tested, SLC35A2 function was completely inhibited by two (S213F and G282R) and partially inhibited by three (R55L, G266V, and S304P), providing a straight-forward mechanism of disease. Interestingly, the remaining three (V331I, V258M, and Y267C) did not impact SLC35A2 function, suggesting that complexities beyond loss of transporter activity may underlie disease due to these mutations. Overall, our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of transport of SLC35A2 and improve understanding of the relationship between SLC35A2 mutations and disease.
PIK3CA is one of the most frequently mutated genes in invasive breast cancer (IBC). These mutations are generally associated with hyper-activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway, which is negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor PTEN. Data is limited regarding the variant allele frequency (VAF) of PIK3CA and PTEN expression during various stages of breast carcinogenesis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to gain insight into PIK3CA VAF and associated PTEN expression during the progression from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to IBC. We isolated DNA from DCIS tissue and synchronous IBC. These samples were pre- screened for PIK3CA hotspot mutations using the SNaPshot assay and, if positive, validated and quantified by digital PCR. PTEN expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using the Histo-score (H-score). Differences in PIK3CA VAF and PTEN H-scores between DCIS and IBC were analyzed. We detected a significantly higher VAF of PIK3CA in the DCIS component compared to the adjacent IBC component (p=0.007). The expression of PTEN was significantly higher in DCIS compared to the IBC component in cases with a wild type (WT) PIK3CA status (p=0.007), while it remained similar in both components when PIK3CA was mutated. In conclusion, our data suggest that PIK3CA mutations could be essential specifically in early stages of breast carcinogenesis. In addition, these mutations do not-co-occur with PTEN expression during DCIS progression to IBC in the majority of patients. These results may contribute to further unraveling the process of breast carcinogenesis and this could aid development of patient-specific treatment.
ADSSL1 myopathy was recently identified as the cause of muscular disorders in Korean patients with distal myopathy. We generated transcriptome profiles of muscles from control subjects and patients with ADSSL1 myopathy. In the present study, RNA sequencing was conducted with seven vastus lateralis muscle samples from four patients with ADSSL1 myopathy and three control subjects. The hierarchical clustering result revealed a separation between myopathy and control groups. A total of 1,260 transcripts were significantly differentially expressed (|fold change| ≥ 2, p < 0.05), with 740 upregulated transcripts and 520 downregulated transcripts in myopathy group. Eighteen transcripts that mapped to purine metabolism pathway were significantly differentially expressed between the two groups, with ten downregulated transcripts and eight upregulated transcripts in myopathy group. In particular, three genes involved in purine nucleotide cycle (ADSSL1, ADSL, and AMPD1) were significantly downregulated in myopathy group. Ten transcripts in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway were also significantly differentially expressed. This is the first study on the altered expression of transcripts in muscle tissues from patients with ADSSL1 myopathy. Our results provide new insights into the pathogenesis of ADSSL1 myopathy.
FUT1 and FUT2 encode alpha 1, 2-fucosyltransferases which catalyze the addition of alpha 1, 2-linked fucose to glycans. Glycan products of FUT1 and FUT2, such as Globo H and Lewis Y, are highly expressed on malignant tissues, including breast cancer. Herein, we investigated the roles of FUT1 and FUT2 in breast cancer. Silencing of FUT1 or FUT2 by shRNAs inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenicity in mice. This was associated with diminished properties of cancer stem cell (CSC), including mammosphere formation and CSC marker both in vitro and in xenografts. Silencing of FUT2, but not FUT1, significantly changed the cuboidal morphology to dense clusters of small and round cells with reduced adhesion to polystyrene and extracellular matrix, including laminin, fibronectin and collagen. Silencing of FUT1 or FUT2 suppressed cell migration in wound healing assay, whereas FUT1 and FUT2 overexpression increased cell migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis of breast cancer in vivo. A decrease in mesenchymal like markers such as fibronectin, vimentin, and twist, along with increased epithelial like marker, E-cadherin, was observed upon FUT1/2 knockdown, while the opposite was noted by overexpression of FUT1 or FUT2. As expected, FUT1 or FUT2 knockdown reduced Globo H, whereas FUT1 or FUT2 overexpression showed contrary effects. Exogenous addition of Globo H-ceramide reversed the suppression of cell migration by FUT1 knockdown but not the inhibition of cell adhesion by FUT2 silencing, suggesting that at least part of the effects of FUT1/2 knockdown were mediated by Globo H. Our results imply that FUT1 and FUT2 play important roles in regulating growth, adhesion, migration and CSC properties of breast cancer, and may serve as therapeutic targets for breast cancer.
ABCG2 has a broad substrate specificity and is one of the most important efflux proteins modulating pharmacokinetics of drugs, nutrients and toxicokinetics of toxicants. ABCG2 is an important player in transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions (tDDI). Areas covered: The aims of the review are i) to cover transporter interaction profile of substrates and inhibitors that can be utilized to test interaction of drug candidates with ABCG2, ii) to highlight main characteristics of in vitro testing and iii) to describe the structural basis of the broad substrate specificity of the protein. Preclinical data utilizing Abcg2/Bcrp1 knockouts and clinical studies showing effect of ABCG2 c.421C>A polymorphism on pharmacokinetics of drugs have provided evidence for a broad array of drug substrates and support drug - ABCG2 interaction testing. A consensus on using rosuvastatin and sulfasalazine as intestinal substrates for clinical studies is in the formation. Other substrates relevant to the therapeutic area can be considered. Monolayer efflux assays and vesicular transport assays have been extensively utilized in vitro. Expert opinion: Clinical substrates display complex pharmacokinetics due to broad interaction profiles with multiple transporters and metabolic enzymes. Substrate-dependent inhibition has been observed for several inhibitors. Harmonization of in vitro and in vivo testing makes sense. However, rosuvastatin and sulfasalazine are not efficiently transported in either MDCKII or LLC-PK1-based monolayers. Caco-2 monolayer assays and vesicular transport assays are potential alternatives.
ELOVL3 is a very long-chain fatty acid elongase, and its mRNA levels display diurnal rhythmic changes exclusively in adult male mouse livers. This cyclical expression of hepatic 
PTEN is a tumor suppressor that is highly mutated in a variety of human cancers. Recent studies have suggested a link between PTEN loss and deficiency in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair. As a means to achieve synthetic lethality in this context, we tested the effect of 3E10, a cell-penetrating autoantibody that inhibits RAD51, a key factor in the alternative pathway of DSB repair, homology dependent repair (HDR). We report here that treatment of PTEN-deficient glioma cells with 3E10 leads to an accumulation of DNA damage causing decreased proliferation and increased cell death compared to isogenic PTEN proficient controls. Similarly, 3E10 was synthetically lethal to a series of PTEN-deficient, patient-derived primary melanoma cell populations. Further, 3E10 was found to synergize with a small molecule inhibitor of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) protein, a DNA damage checkpoint kinase, in both PTEN-deficient glioma cells and primary melanoma cells. These results point to a targeted synthetic lethal strategy to treat PTEN-deficient cancers through a combination designed to disrupt both DNA repair and DNA damage checkpoint signaling.
ABO blood group incompatibility between mother and fetus can lead to hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). We present the first case of severe O/A HDFN associated with extremely high-titer (1:32 000) immunoglobulin G anti-A antibodies in a Cameroon mother. Cord blood analysis revealed severe fetal hemolytic anemia and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. After exclusion of an underlying disease and other risk factors, cholestasis resolved after treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid, a red blood cell transfusion, and intravenous immunoglobulins. This case is presented to create awareness for a more severe course of ABO HDFN in nonwhite and non-European mother-child pairs.
NME1 (also known as NM23-H1) was the first identified tumor metastasis suppressor, which has been reported to link with genomic stability maintenance and cancer. However its underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here we find that NME1 is required for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Mechanistically, NME1 re-localizes to DNA damage sites in a Ku-XRCC4-dependent manner, and regulates downstream LIG4 recruitment and end joining efficiency. Furthermore, we show that the 3'-5' exonuclease activity of NME1 is critical for its function in NHEJ. Taken together, our findings identify NME1 as a novel NHEJ factor, and reveal how this metastasis suppressor promotes genome stability.
COMT gene polymorphism is associated with mental disorders and sensitivity to pain. In this study, we investigated the association between the COMT gene polymorphism and labor anxiety and analgesia in pregnant women.
ABCG2 is a high-capacity urate transporter that plays a crucial role in renal urate overload and extra-renal urate underexcretion. Previous studies have suggested an association between hyperuricemia and gout susceptibility relative to dysfunctional ABCG2 variants, with rs2231142 (Q141K) being the most common. In this study, we analyzed the ABCG2 gene in a hyperuricemia and gout cohort focusing on patients with pediatric-onset, i.e., before 18 years of age.
ABCB1 encodes Multidrug Resistance protein (MDR1), an ATP-binding cassette member involved in the cellular efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs. Here we report that ovarian and breast samples from chemotherapy treated patients are positive for multiple transcriptional fusions involving ABCB1, placing it under the control of a strong promoter while leaving its open reading frame intact. We identified 15 different transcriptional fusion partners involving ABCB1, as well as patients with multiple distinct fusion events. The partner gene selected depended on its structure, promoter strength, and chromosomal proximity to ABCB1. Fusion positivity was strongly associated with the number of lines of MDR1-substrate chemotherapy given. MDR1 inhibition in a fusion positive ovarian cancer cell line increased sensitivity to paclitaxel more than 50-fold. Convergent evolution of ABCB1 fusion is therefore frequent in chemotherapy resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. As most currently approved PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are MDR1 substrates, prior chemotherapy may precondition resistance to PARPi.
CYP1B1 is a member of the CYP1 subfamily of CYP superfamily of enzymes, which contains three members, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1. CYP1B1 is expressed in both adult and fetal human extrahepatic tissues, including the parenchymal and stromal cells of most organs. Mutations in the CYP1B1 gene are linked to the development of primary congenital glaucoma in humans. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using 
SLC7A11 (or xCT) imports extracellular cystine into cells to promote glutathione synthesis, thus inhibiting ferroptosis. SLC7A11 expression is tightly controlled in normal cells and its dysregulation results in aberrant expression of SLC7A11 in human cancers. We recently discovered that tumor suppressor BAP1, a H2A deubiquitinase, represses SLC7A11 expression by reducing H2A ubiquitination (H2Aub) on the SLC7A11 promoter. BAP1 inactivation in cancer cells leads to SLC7A11 de-repression, ferroptosis resistance, and tumor development. Here we show that BAP1 promotes ferroptosis induced by class I ferroptosis inducer (FIN) erastin but not by class II FIN RSL3, further supporting that BAP1 regulates ferroptosis through SLC7A11. In addition, we studied how BAP1 coordinates with other transcription factors to regulate SLC7A11 expression and show that BAP1-mediated SLC7A11 repression does not require NRF2 and ATF4 transcription factors. Finally, we show that, while BAP1 decreases whereas PRC1 (a major H2Aub ubiquitin ligase) increases H2Aub binding on the SLC7A11 promoter, both BAP1 and PRC1 represses SLC7A11 expression, suggesting that a dynamic regulation of H2Aub is important for SLC7A11 repression. Together, our data provide additional insights on epigenetic regulation of SLC7A11 expression in cancer cells.
B4GALT7 encodes beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase which links glycosaminoglycans to proteoglycans in connective tissues. Rare, biallelic variants in B4GALT7 have been associated with spondylodysplastic Ehlers-Danlos and Larsen of Reunion Island syndromes. Thirty patients with B4GALT7-related disorders have been reported to date with phenotypic variability. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified male and female siblings with biallelic, pathogenic B4GALT7 variants and phenotypic features of spondylodysplastic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome as well as previously unreported skeletal characteristics. We also provide detailed radiological characterization and describe the siblings' responses to growth hormone treatment. Our report extends the phenotypic spectrum of B4GALT7-associated spondylodysplastic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and reports results of growth hormone treatment for patients with this rare disorder.
PAH formation was more affected by marinating than by changing the grilling temperature. Inhibitory effects grew as the concentration of phenolic marinade increased within limits. The antiradical activity and the inhibition of PAHs formation have no direct relation.
DOT1L is a histone H3 Lys79 methyltransferase whose activity is stimulated by histone H2B Lys120 ubiquitination, suggesting cross-talk between histone H3 methylation and H2B ubiquitination. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of DOT1L complexes with unmodified or H2B ubiquitinated nucleosomes, showing that DOT1L recognizes H2B ubiquitin and the H2A/H2B acidic patch through a C-terminal hydrophobic helix and an arginine anchor in DOT1L, respectively. Furthermore, the structures combined with single-molecule FRET experiments show that H2B ubiquitination enhances a noncatalytic function of the DOT1L-destabilizing nucleosome. These results establish the molecular basis of the cross-talk between H2B ubiquitination and H3 Lys79 methylation as well as nucleosome destabilization by DOT1L.
PFAS shows various cross-reactivities with antigens because of the area in which the patient resides and dietary habits, and progress in component allergen analysis in recent years has clarified the pathogenesis. This review describes newly identified findings for antigens involved in PFAS.
FUT3 gene is responsible for encode an homonymous α1,3/4-fucosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of sialyl-Lewis antigens. FUT3-fucosylated glycoconjugates play key roles in pathways involved in tumor biology and metastasis, such as cellular ligation to E-selectins, TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, NK cell-mediated tumor cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Tumor-associated FUT3 promoter polymorphism rs2306969 (-6951 C> T, position related to the gene's translation start site) has been linked to breast, ovarian and intestinal gastric cancer. Although non-coding polymorphisms accounts for the majority of variations founded in breast cancer, their functional roles are still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of different alleles for this variation in FUT3 expression of invasive breast tumors. A luciferase reporter assay was performed using two breast tumor cell lines to evaluate respectively the impact of FUT3 rs2306969 (-6951 CC) and (-6951 TT) on protein expression. Gene and protein expressions were also measured in twenty-nine fresh biopsies of invasive breast tumors. Rs2306969 did not significantly influence FUT3 expression in both used systems. However, this study is defiant since the biological role of this polymorphism in breast cancer and other tumor types could be linked to cis/trans modulation of other genes, respond to different environmental stimuli or impact gene expression only in association with other variations. Rs2306969 did not modulate FUT3 expression in breast tumors under non-stimulated conditions. Nevertheless, our study contributes to the notably challenging task that is to understand how non-coding polymorphisms can drive the overall risk in cancer development.
CYP2C19 loss-of-function single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with poor responses of clopidogrel in secondary prevention of ischemic stroke (IS). It is still unclear whether these SNPs, which may result in poor cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) enzymatic activity, affect the occurrence of IS and its subtypes. The present study evaluated the relationship between the CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles and IS.
SLC1A2 is a trimeric transporter essential for clearing glutamate from neuronal synapses. Recurrent de novo SLC1A2 missense variants cause a severe, early onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy via an unclear mechanism. We demonstrate that all 3 variants implicated in this condition localize to the trimerization domain of SLC1A2, and that the Leu85Pro variant acts via a dominant negative mechanism to reduce, but not eliminate, wild-type SLC1A2 protein localization and function. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment of a 20-month-old SLC1A2-related epilepsy patient with the SLC1A2-modulating agent ceftriaxone did not result in a significant change in daily spasm count. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:921-926.
CD38 has emerged as a high-impact therapeutic target in multiple myeloma, with the approval of daratumumab (anti-CD38 mAb). The clinical importance of CD38 in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been known for over 2 decades, although it's relevance as a therapeutic target in CLL remains understudied.
UCP2 is involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial function, immune response and regulation of oxidative stress under physiological or pathological conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of UCP2 on mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress in septic acute kidney injury (AKI).
CA1 neurons in epileptic animals are vulnerable to selective changes in ion channel expression, called acquired channelopathies, which can increase the excitability of a neuron. Under normal conditions there is a gradient of ion channel expression and intrinsic excitability along the longitudinal, dorsoventral axis of hippocampal area CA1 of the rodent. Many of these channels, including M-channels, GIRK channels and HCN channels, all have dorsoventral expression gradients that might be altered in rodent models of epilepsy. Here, we show that the excitability of dorsal, but not ventral CA1 neurons, had an increased firing rate, reduced interspike interval (ISI) and increased input resistance in a status epilepticus (SE) model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). As a result, the excitability of CA1 neurons became uniform across the dorsoventral axis of the rat hippocampus post-SE. Using current clamp recordings with pharmacology and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that the expression of HCN channels was downregulated in the dorsal CA1 region post-SE, while the expression of M and GIRK channels were unchanged. We did not find this acquired channelopathy in ventral CA1 neurons post-SE. Our results suggest that the excitability of dorsal CA1 neurons post-SE increase to resemble the intrinsic properties of ventral CA1 neurons, which likely makes the hippocampal circuit more permissible to seizures, and contributes to the cognitive impairments associated with chronic epilepsy.
CFTR modulator therapy with ivacaftor is a treatment option for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients with at least one copy of a R117H-7T mutation in the CFTR gene. Desirable effects of this therapy are improvement of lung function, decrease in exacerbation rate, normalization or reduction of sweat chloride and weight gain. Monogenetic CF-twins carry identical genetic information, so therapy response and side effects are expected to be nearly identical under this specific therapy.

CD38 on CD8 + T cells is considered a reliable marker of HIV disease progression. Withania somnifer, a traditional ayurvedic medicine, has Th1 immunomodulatory properties. PBMCs from 38 HIV patients were exposed to Withania somnifer root extract at standardized concentration. An overall decline in the percentage of CD38 expressing CD8 + T lymphocytes was observed, though the statistical significance was varied with different categories of HIV patients. Withania somnifer could have promising impact on HIV disease and therefore warrants a further study on larger parameters.
CYP1A1 rs1048943 polymorphism was reported to be correlated with periodontitis; however, its association with aggressive periodontitis (AgP) has not yet been investigated. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between the CYP1A1 gene rs1048943 variant with generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) and platelet activation and analyse whether its interaction with hyperlipidemia affects periodontal status in a Chinese population.
CD36 is a class B scavenger-receptor involved in the uptake of fatty acids in liver and adipose tissue. It is unknown whether plasma CD36 levels are related to liver fat content or adipose tissue in the general population.
PIK3C2A is a class II member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) family that catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) into PI(3)P and the phosphorylation of PI(4)P into PI(3,4)P2. At the cellular level, PIK3C2A is critical for the formation of cilia and for receptor mediated endocytosis, among other biological functions. We identified homozygous loss-of-function mutations in PIK3C2A in children from three independent consanguineous families with short stature, coarse facial features, cataracts with secondary glaucoma, multiple skeletal abnormalities, neurological manifestations, among other findings. Cellular studies of patient-derived fibroblasts found that they lacked PIK3C2A protein, had impaired cilia formation and function, and demonstrated reduced proliferative capacity. Collectively, the genetic and molecular data implicate mutations in PIK3C2A in a new Mendelian disorder of PI metabolism, thereby shedding light on the critical role of a class II PI3K in growth, vision, skeletal formation and neurological development. In particular, the considerable phenotypic overlap, yet distinct features, between this syndrome and Lowe's syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the PI-5-phosphatase OCRL, highlight the key role of PI metabolizing enzymes in specific developmental processes and demonstrate the unique non-redundant functions of each enzyme. This discovery expands what is known about disorders of PI metabolism and helps unravel the role of PIK3C2A and class II PI3Ks in health and disease.
CD36 is a multifunctional scavenger receptor and lipid transporter implicated in metabolic and inflammatory pathologies, as well as cancer progression. CD36 is known to be expressed by adipocytes and monocytes/macrophages, but its expression by T cells is not clearly established. We found that CD4 and CD8 T cells in adipose tissue and liver of humans, monkeys, and mice upregulated CD36 expression (ranging from ~5-40% CD36+), whereas little to no CD36 was expressed by T cells in blood, spleen, and lymph nodes. CD36 was expressed predominantly by resting CD38-, HLA.DR-, and PD-1- adipose tissue T cells in monkeys, and increased during high-fat feeding in mice. Adipose tissue and liver promote a distinct phenotype in resident T cells characterized by CD36 upregulation.

ABCB6 belongs to the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes, bearing significant impact on human disease and pharmacology. Although mutations in the ABCB6 gene have been linked to a variety of pathophysiological conditions ranging from transfusion incompatibility to pigmentation defects, its precise cellular localization and function is not understood. In particular, the intracellular localization of ABCB6 has been a matter of debate, with conflicting reports suggesting mitochondrial or endolysosomal expression. ABCB6 shows significant sequence identity to HMT-1 (heavy metal tolerance factor 1) proteins, whose evolutionarily conserved role is to confer tolerance to heavy metals through the intracellular sequestration of metal complexes. Here, we show that the cadmium-sensitive phenotype of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Caenorhabditis elegans strains defective for HMT-1 is rescued by the human ABCB6 protein. Overexpression of ABCB6 conferred tolerance to cadmium and As(III) (As
TPP1 mutations have been identified in patients with variable phenotypes such as late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL), juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL), and spinocerebellar ataxia 7. However, the mechanism underlying phenotype variation is unknown. We screened TPP1 mutations in patients with epilepsies and analyzed the genotype-phenotype correlation to explain the phenotypic variations.
TK2 gene encodes for mitochondrial thymidine kinase, which phosphorylates the pyrimidine nucleosides thymidine and deoxycytidine. Recessive mutations in the TK2 gene are responsible for the 'myopathic form' of the mitochondrial depletion/multiple deletions syndrome, with a wide spectrum of severity.
PTEN gene triggers cells to undergo apoptosis and promotes myocardial dysfunction. Several TNF family cytokines are elevated during acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Their role in predicting subsequent prognosis in these setting remains poorly understood. We assessed serum levels of PTEN gene activity & TNF-α in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction and determined the impact of their levels on both left ventricular function and the clinical outcome in these patients.
IDH1 mutant gliomas are thought to have distinct metabolic characteristics, including a blunted response to hypoxia and lower glycolytic flux. We hypothesized non-invasive quantification of abnormal metabolic behavior in human IDH1 mutant gliomas could be performed using a new pH- and oxygen-sensitive molecular MRI technique.
PFAS (perfluoroalkyl substances) are considered non-genotoxic. However, PFAS exposure has been associated with the induction of oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo, and the possible induction of indirect genotoxic effects under sustained PFAS exposure has not been investigated. In order to shed light on this aspect, in this study a comprehensive assessment of genotoxicity was carried out in mice administered with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, 0.1, 1 and 5 mg/kg body weight) and its C4 analogue perfluorobutyric acid (PFBA, 5 mg/kg body weight) for five weeks through drinking water. Markers of cell toxicity, oxidative stress and DNA strand breaks were measured in liver, the main target of toxicity of PFOA in rodents; systemic genotoxicity was also assessed by the analysis of micronuclei in reticulocytes and spleen lymphocytes, and germ cell effects by the Comet assay on testis cells. PFOA administration at the highest dose (5 mg/kg body weight) induced marked liver hypertrophy with signs of cell injury (elevated ALT and AST), with no concurrent evidence of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress (decreased antioxidant capacity). Only mild liver hypertrophy, with no other signs of toxicity, was determined by PFBA administration. No evidence of treatment related genotoxicity was observed in any experimental group. Overall, data indicate that under the experimental conditions of this study, severe liver toxicity induced by PFOA administration is not associated with oxidative stress. Accordingly, no genotoxic effect is observed in liver and in the other tissues examined. Milder evidence of liver toxicity, with no genotoxicity, and a lower tendency to bioaccumulation were observed in PFBA treated mice.
PAH dimerization has been widely posited to play an important, even rate-determining role in soot nucleation, despite scanty experimental evidence of the existence of PAH dimers in flames. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) offers a promising in situ method of identifying PAH dimers, if dimer fluorescence can be distinguished from the fluorescence of the constituent monomers and other species present. Predicting transition energies for excited dimers (excimers) and excited complexes (exciplexes) represents a significant challenge for theory. Nonempirically tuned LC-BLYP functionals have been used to compute excited-state geometries and emission energies for a database of 81 inter- and intramolecular PAH excimers and exciplexes. Exciplex emission energies depend sensitively on the topology of the PAHs involved, but a linear relationship between the mean monomer bandgap and the computed exciplex emission means that dimer electronic properties can be predicted based on the properties of the constituent monomers. The range of fluorescence energies calculated for structures containing small to moderately-sized PAHs indicates that either noncovalent or aliphatically-linked complexes could generate the visible-range fluorescence energies observed in LIF experiments.
SETD1A is a SET domain-containing methyltransferase involved in epigenetic regulation of transcription. It is the main catalytic component of a multiprotein complex that methylates lysine 4 of histone H3, a histone mark associated with gene activation. In humans, six related protein complexes with partly nonredundant cellular functions share several protein subunits but are distinguished by unique catalytic SET-domain proteins. We surveyed physical interactions of the SETD1A-complex using endogenous immunoprecipitation followed by label-free quantitative proteomics on three subunits: SETD1A, RBBP5, and ASH2L. Surprisingly, SETD1A, but not RBBP5 or ASH2L, was found to interact with the DNA damage repair protein RAD18. Reciprocal RAD18 immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction with SETD1A, whereas size exclusion and protein network analysis suggested an interaction independent of the main SETD1A complex. We found evidence of SETD1A and RAD18 influence on mutual gene expression levels. Further, knockdown of the genes individually showed a DNA damage repair phenotype, whereas simultaneous knockdown resulted in an epistatic effect. This adds to a growing body of work linking epigenetic enzymes to processes involved in genome stability.
CD38 is a multi-functional signaling enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of two calcium-mobilizing second messengers: cyclic ADP-ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate. It also regulates intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) contents, associated with multiple pathophysiological processes such as aging and cancer. As such, enzymatic inhibitors of CD38 offer great potential in drug development. Here, through virtual screening and enzymatic assays, we discovered compound LX-102, which targets CD38 on the side opposite its enzymatic pocket with a binding affinity of 7.7 μm. It inhibits the NADase activity of CD38 with an IC
UGT2B7 was recently acknowledged as a new critical enzyme involved in biotransformation of a variety of carcinogens, whose function was reported to be significantly associated with its encoding gene (UGT2B7) polymorphisms. However, results regarding the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of UGT2B7 and cancer risk still remained controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to further elucidate the role of UGT2B7 SNPs on cancer susceptibilities.

CYP2C19 is a metabolizing enzyme and heat shock proteins (HSP) are induced in stress conditions, such as hypoxia and ischemia. Recently, polymorphism in CYP2C19 and HSP genes has been observed in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD).
GNE myopathy is an autosomal-recessive distal myopathy. It is caused by a hypomorphic GNE gene, encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in sialic acid synthesis. This myopathy is prevalent in the Iranian Jewish (IJ) descendants because of a founder mutation GNE: p. M712T. We report a 52-year-old IJ woman who presented with a 20-year history of progressive distal muscle weakness. Physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging revealed lower-extremity weakness and atrophy. Electromyography confirmed myopathy. Genetic testing showed no mutations on the GNE gene. Muscle histochemistry demonstrated no rimmed vacuoles. The analysis of polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule Western blot pattern was negative. Non-GNE myopathy with quadriceps sparing presentation has been previously described in a few cases of non-IJ descents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of an IJ patient, presenting with quadriceps sparing myopathy, without associated GNE mutations and/or tubule-filamentous inclusions.

CYP2D6 genetic variations could result in alteration of CYP2D6 enzyme activity, leading to dissimilarity among individuals in regard of drug metabolism.This study aims to detect all genetic variants, allele, and genotype frequencies of CYP2D6 gene in 136 unrelated healthy Kinh Vietnamese volunteers. All single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and structural variations (SVs) of CYP2D6 gene were identified by Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay.Totally, 30 SNVs and 9 SVs including a whole gene deletion, 8 hybrid structures, and tandem arrangements were identified. Of the 7 novel SNVs detected, the 3157G>T (R329L) substitution was predicted to be deleterious by PROVEAN; the 3851G>A (W358X) variant resulted in a truncated protein; and the 2988G>A variant located in the intron 6 was predicted to be capable of modifying splicing motif by Human Splicing Finder. We determined 29 different genotypes of CYP2D6 from 136 individuals. The most common alleles were the CYP2D6*10 (43.75%), *1 (18.75%), and tandem arrangement *36-*10 (12.13%).This study provides best information on CYP2D6 polymorphism comprising the newly discovered SNVs, structural variations, and their frequencies in Kinh Vietnamese. These new data would be valuable in view of precise dosing of CYP2D6 metabolized drugs and giving better treatment outcome.
PTEN loss stimulates prostate tumor progression by sustaining AKT activation. Nowak et al. (2019. 
PIGQ (OMIM *605754) encodes phosphatidylinositol glycan biosynthesis class Q (PIGQ) and is required for proper functioning of an N-acetylglucosamine transferase complex in a similar manner to the more established PIGA, PIGC, and PIGH. There are two previous patients reported with homozygous and apparently deleterious PIGQ mutations. Here, we provide the first detailed clinical report of a patient with heterozygous deleterious mutations associated with glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (GPI-AP) biosynthesis deficiency. Our patient died at 10 months of age. The rare skeletal findings in this disorder expand the differential diagnosis of long bone radiolucent lesions and sphenoid wing dysplasia. This clinical report describes a new and rare disorder-PIGQ GPI-AP biosynthesis deficiency syndrome.
KCNJ11 gene activating mutations play a major role in the development of neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM). KCNJ 11 gene encodes the Kir 6.2 subunit of ATP- sensitive potassium channel which is a critical regulator of pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion.
SLC26A4 gene mutations lead to Pendred syndrome and non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB4). The mouse model is well used to study the pathology of Pendred syndrome, however, mice with different Slc26a4 mutations exhibit different phenotypes, and these mice have severe deafness and inner ear malformations that are not imitated less severely Human phenotype. In this study, we generated a knock-in mouse model of Pendred syndrome with Slc26a4 L236P mutation to mimic the most common mutation found in human. Some L236P mice were observed to have significant vestibular dysfunction including torticollis and circling, the giant otoconia and destruction of the otoconial membrane was observed in L236P mice. Unlike other profoundly deafness in Slc26a4 mouse model, L236P mice present mild to profound hearing loss, consistent with the hearing threshold, inner ear hair cells also lost from slight to significant. Together, these data demonstrate that the L236P mouse phenotype is more similar to the human phenotype and should be used as a tool for further research into the human Pendred syndrome.
ABCG2 is the principal ABC transporter involved in the multidrug resistance of breast cancer. Looking at the current demand in the development of ABCG2 inhibitors for the treatment of multidrug-resistant cancer, we have explored structural requirements of phenyltetrazole derivatives for ABCG2 inhibition by combining classical QSAR, Bayesian classification modelling and molecular docking studies. For classical QSAR, structural descriptors were calculated from the free software tool PaDEL-descriptor. Stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) was used for model generation. A statistically significant model was generated and validated with different parameters (For training set: 
PNPLA3 I148M polymorphism has an effect on modulation of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in nonobese nondiabetic adults and in children with histologically confirmed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
CD36 is associated with regulation of lipid metabolism, atherosclerosis, and blood pressure. Moreover, its variation may be involved in the development of hypertension and/or coronary artery disease (CAD). The present study was conducted to investigate the possible association of CD36 rs1761667 (G > A) polymorphism with hypertension and/or CAD in the southeastern of Iran.

SMPD3 deficiency in the neutral sphingomyelinase (Smpd3
PIK3CA has been extensively investigated from its molecular mechanism perspective and association with its mutations in different types of cancers. However, little has been reported regarding the pathological significance of PIK3CA expression in teleost. Here, in our present study, three PIK3CA genes termed SmPIK3CAa, SmPIK3CAb and SmPIK3CA-like were firstly identified in the genome of turbot S. maximus. Although these three genes located in different chromosomes, all of them share the same five domains. Phylogenetic and synteny analysis indicated that SmPIK3CAa, SmPIK3CAb and SmPIK3CA-like were three paralogs that may originate from duplication of the same ancestral PIK3CA gene. Subcellular localization analysis confirmed the cytoplasm distribution of these three paralogs. All three SmPIK3CA were ubiquitously expressed in examined tissues in turbot, with the higher expression levels in immune-related tissues such as blood, spleen, kidney, gills and intestines. Upon Vibrio anguillarum challenge, SmPIK3CAa and SmPIK3CA-like transcripts were significantly induced in spleen, intestine and blood despite of differential expression levels and responsive time points. Additionally, individuals in resistant group showed significantly higher expression level of both two genes than in the susceptible group. Moreover, four SNPs (102, 2530, 3027 and 3060) and one haplotype (Hap2) located in exon region of SmPIK3CA-like were identified and confirmed to be associated with V. anguillarum resistance in turbot by association analysis in different populations. Taken together, these results suggested that functional differentiation occurred in three SmPIK3CA paralogs with Vibrio anguillarum resistance and SmPIK3CAa and SmPIK3CA-like probable play potential roles in innate immune response to pathogenic invasions in turbot.
IDH1 mutations are early events in the development of IDH-mutant gliomas and leukemias and are associated with various regulation of molecular process. Mutations of active site in IDH1 could lead to high levels of 2-HG and the suppression of cellular differentiation, while these changes can be reversed by molecule inhibitors target mutant IDH1. Here, through in-house developed enzymatic assay-based high throughput screening platform, we discovered DC_H31 as a novel IDH1-R132H/C inhibitor, with the IC
ABCA3 is a phospholipid transporter implicated in pulmonary surfactant homoeostasis and localized at the limiting membrane of lamellar bodies, the storage compartment for surfactant in alveolar type II cells. Mutations in ABCA3 display a common genetic cause for diseases caused by surfactant deficiency like respiratory distress in neonates and interstitial lung disease in children and adults, for which currently no causal therapy exists. In this study, we investigated the effects of ivacaftor and genistein, two potentiators of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), on ABCA3-specific lipid transport function. Wild-type (WT) and functional ABCA3 mutations N568D, F629L, G667R, T1114M and L1580P were stably expressed in A549 cells. Three-dimensional modelling predicted functional impairment for all five mutants that was confirmed by in vitro experiments (all <14% of WT functional activity). Treatment with potentiators rescued the mutants N568D (up to 114% of WT), F629L (up to 47% of WT), and G667R (up to 60% of WT), the latter variation needing higher concentrations of genistein, showing reduced affinity of the potentiator to the mutant protein. Our results present a first proof that functional ABCA3 mutations are rescued by CFTR potentiators, making them a potential therapeutical option for patients suffering from surfactant deficiency due to ABCA3 mutations.
PIK3CD encodes the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit, p110δ, a lipid kinase linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia (SZ). PIK3CD is regulated at the transcript level through alternate use of 5' untranslated exons (UTRs), promoters, and proinflammatory cytokines. Increases in global PIK3CD expression and downregulation by neuroleptics are observed in SZ, and preclinical efficacy of a p110δ-selective inhibitor is seen in rodent models of risk. Here, we cloned PIK3CD alternative transcripts in human brain and evaluated temporal- and tissue-specific expression. We quantified PIK3CD transcripts in B-lymphoblastoid cells from patients with SZ and examined 5' UTR transcriptional regulation by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin-1β (IL1β) in patient-derived fibroblasts. We report that PIK3CD transcripts are differentially expressed in human brain in a developmental-specific manner. Transcripts encoding 5' UTRs -2A and alternative exon -1 (Alt1), P37 and AS1 and AS2 were increased in SZ. Alt1, P37, and AS2 were also preferentially expressed in fetal brain, and all transcripts were regulated by TNFα and IL1β. Our findings provide novel insight into the complexity of PIK3CD regulation in human brain, implicate PIK3CD in human neurodevelopment, and identify isoform-specific disruption in SZ.
CD38 (Cluster of Differentiation 38) is a multifunctional ecto-enzyme that metabolizes NAD+ and mediates nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD+) and extracellular nucleotide homeostasis as well as intracellular calcium. CD38 is also an emerging therapeutic target under conditions in which metabolism is altered including infection, aging, and tumorigenesis. We describe multiple enzymatic activities of CD38, which may explain the breadth of biological roles observed for this enzyme. Of greatest significance is the role of CD38 as an ecto-enzyme capable of modulating extracellular NAD+ precursor availability: 1 to bacteria unable to perform de novo synthesis of NAD+; and 2 in aged parenchyma impacted by the accumulation of immune cells during the process of 'inflammaging'. We also discuss the paradoxical role of CD38 as a modulator of intracellular NAD+, particularly in tumor immunity. Finally, we provide a summary of therapeutic approaches to CD38 inhibition and 'NAD+ boosting' for treatment of metabolic dysfunction observed during aging and in tumor immunity. The present review summarizes the role of CD38 in nicotinamide nucleotide homeostasis with special emphasis on the role of CD38 as an immunomodulator and druggable target.
SDHB mutations are found in an increasing number of neoplasms, most notably in paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas (PPGLs). SDHB-PPGLs are slow-growing tumors, but ∼50% of them may develop metastasis. The molecular basis of metastasis in these tumors is a long-standing and unresolved problem. Thus, a better understanding of the biology of metastasis is needed.
PTEN mutation status is a pivotal biomarker for glioblastoma. This study aimed to establish a radiomic signature to predict PTEN mutation status in patients with glioblastoma, and to investigate the genetic background behind this radiomic signature.
SMYD3 is a histone methyltransferase that regulates gene transcription, and its overexpression is associated with multiple human cancers. A novel class of tetrahydroacridine compounds which inhibit SMYD3 through a covalent mechanism of action is identified. Optimization of these irreversible inhibitors resulted in the discovery of 4-chloroquinolines, a new class of covalent warheads. Tool compound 
ABO compatibility rules in kidney transplantation have been deeply modified with the possibility of ABO-incompatible transplantation. The recipient has to be prepared in the days preceding surgery with an objective of ABO antibody titers of 1/8 or less. This is obtained through a procedure including antibody removal, rituximab and IV immunoglobulins alone or in association according to the initial titer. All ABO combinations are possible. Due to the preparation of the recipient, living related transplantation has been first carried out but ABO-incompatible transplantation from a deceased donor is becoming common practice in some countries (A2 or A2B donor to a B recipient). Lower uncensored graft survival has been reported by some studies but not when ABO-incompatible kidney transplantations were compared with matched ABO-compatible ones. The infectious risk in the perioperative period, consequence of higher immunosuppression, raises concern. The interlaboratory variability in hemagglutination anti-A/B assays remains an important question among cohort studies which leads to development of new tests. ABO-incompatible transplantation is associated with a rare process, accommodation, that is well known in xenotransplantation and according to which, the transplant is protected against the consequences of ABO antibody binding. In human kidney ABO-incompatible transplantation, few studies are available but suggest that this protection against the post-transplant antibody rebound might be mediated by the expression of anti-complement molecules by endothelial cells.
SETMAR is a fusion between a SET-domain methyltransferase gene and a mariner-family transposase gene, which is specific to anthropoid primates. However, the ancestral SET gene is present in all other mammals and birds. SETMAR is reported to be involved in transcriptional regulation and a diverse set of reactions related to DNA repair. Since the transcriptional effects of SETMAR depend on site-specific DNA binding, and are perturbed by inactivating the methyltransferase, we wondered whether we could differentiate the effects of the SET and MAR domains in DNA repair assays. We therefore generated several stable U2OS cell lines expressing either wild type SETMAR or truncation or point mutant variants. We tested these cell lines with in vivo plasmid-based assays to determine the relevance of the different domains and activities of SETMAR in DNA repair. Contrary to previous reports, we found that wild type SETMAR had little to no effect on the rate of cell division, DNA integration into the genome or non-homologous end joining. Also contrary to previous reports, we failed to detect any effect of a strong active-site mutation that should have knocked out the putative nuclease activity of SETMAR.

CYP19A1 enzyme (aromatase) encoded by CYP19A1 (cytochrome p450 family 19 subfamily a member 1) gene plays a key role in the biosynthesis of estrogen, which has been significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). To ascertain whether CYP19A1 gene polymorphisms are correlated with the susceptibility to AD, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis of currently available studies.
GNE myopathy is a rare progressive myopathy caused by biallelic mutations in the 
CD38 is expressed in several types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and constitutes a promising target for antibody-based therapy. Daratumumab (Darzalex) is a first-in-class anti-CD38 antibody approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. It has also demonstrated clinical activity in Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia and amyloidosis. Here, we have evaluated the activity and mechanism of action of daratumumab in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models of mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma, as monotherapy or in combination with standard chemo-immunotherapy. In vitro, daratumumab engages Fc-mediated cytotoxicity by antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis in all lymphoma subtypes. In the presence of human serum, complement-dependent cell cytotoxicity was marginally engaged. We demonstrated by Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy that daratumumab fully penetrated a 3D lymphoma organoid and decreased organoid volume. In vivo, daratumumab completely prevents tumor outgrowth in models of mantle cell and follicular lymphoma, and shows comparable activity to rituximab in a disseminated in vivo model of blastic mantle cell lymphoma. Moreover, daratumumab improves overall survival in a mouse model of transformed CD20dim follicular lymphoma, where rituximab showed limited activity. Daratumumab potentiates the antitumor activity of CHOP and R-CHOP in mantle cell and follicular lymphoma xenografts. Furthermore, in a patient-derived diffuse large B cell lymphoma xenograft model, daratumumab anti-tumor activity was comparable to R-CHOP and the addition of daratumumab to either CHOP or R-CHOP led to full tumor regression. In summary, daratumumab constitutes a novel therapeutic opportunity in certain scenarios and these results warrant further clinical development.
DOT1L methylates histone H3K79 and is aberrantly regulated in MLL-rearranged leukemia. Inhibitors have been developed to target DOT1L activity in leukemia, but cellular mechanisms that regulate DOT1L are still poorly understood. We have identified the histone deacetylase Rpd3 as a negative regulator of budding yeast Dot1. At its target genes, the transcriptional repressor Rpd3 restricts H3K79 methylation, explaining the absence of H3K79me3 at a subset of genes in the yeast genome. Similar to the crosstalk in yeast, inactivation of the murine Rpd3 homolog HDAC1 in thymocytes led to an increase in H3K79 methylation. Thymic lymphomas that arise upon genetic deletion of Hdac1 retained the increased H3K79 methylation and were sensitive to reduced DOT1L dosage. Furthermore, cell lines derived from Hdac1
ABO and Rh compatibility are not required between the donor and recipient for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Although ABO incompatibility is not considered a contraindication in alloHSCT, its clinical outcomes are still doubtful. In this study, we analyzed the neutrophil and platelet recovery, graft versus host disease (GVHD), relapse rate, mortality rate, non-relapse mortality and survival in patients who underwent alloHSCT.
IDO1 (Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1) inhibits host anti-tumor immune response by exhausting tryptophan in tumor microenvironment, but the pathogenic mechanisms of IDO1 in gastric cancer (GC) cells need to be further explored.
PNP pincer ligands stabilise diamagnetic base metal catalysts, and much effort has been invested in the development of chiral analogues for asymmetric catalysis. Starting from the conformational issues that affect P-stereogenic diphosphines, we extend the analysis to our recently prepared P-stereogenic PNP pincer ligands, which we used in the iron(ii)-catalysed hydrogenation of ketones. Backbone rigidity and size (and shape) of the substituents at phosphorus are pivotal in both bi- and tridentate P-stereogenic ligands, and their interplay is discussed, as well as the contribution (and shortcomings) of DFT calculations to the understanding of the conformational flexibility and enantiodiscrimination.
BDH2 is a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family member involved in several biological and pathological processes, including the utilization of cytosolic ketone bodies, immunocyte regulation and tumor progression. In this study, we first revealed that BDH2 was downregulated in HCC tissues by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis and that low BHD2 expression was significantly associated with poor overall survival, poor tumor differentiation, increased tumor size, venous invasion and an advanced BCLC stage. Moreover, the results of a univariate analysis and multivariate analysis revealed that BDH2 may be regarded as an independent prognostic marker. As a member of a gene family involved in ketone metabolism, BDH2 upregulated the level of β-HB in liver cells as well as the level of H3 histone acetylation. Functional analysis showed that BDH2 expression inhibited tumor cell growth, proliferation and migration. The results of the mechanistic analysis revealed that BDH2 induced mitochondrial apoptosis and inhibited autophagy through the unfolded protein response. Therefore, BDH2 may be a new HCC prognostic marker and a useful treatment target.
CD36 is a platelet membrane glycoprotein whose engagement with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) results in platelet activation. The CD36 gene has been associated with platelet count, platelet volume, as well as lipid levels and CVD risk by genome-wide association studies. Platelet CD36 expression levels have been shown to be associated with both the platelet oxLDL response and an elevated risk of thrombo-embolism. Several genomic variants have been identified as associated with platelet CD36 levels, however none have been conclusively demonstrated to be causative. We screened 81 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with platelet CD36 expression by a Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA) and analyzed the results with a novel Bayesian statistical method. Ten eQTLs located 13kb to 55kb upstream of the CD36 transcriptional start site of transcript ENST00000309881 and 49kb to 92kb upstream of transcript ENST00000447544, demonstrated significant transcription shifts between their minor and major allele in the MPRA assay. Of these, rs2366739 and rs1194196, separated by only 20bp, were confirmed by luciferase assay to alter transcriptional regulation. In addition, electromobility shift assays demonstrated differential DNA:protein complex formation between the two alleles of this locus. Furthermore, deletion of the genomic locus by CRISPR/Cas9 in K562 and Meg-01 cells results in upregulation of CD36 transcription. These data indicate that we have identified a variant that regulates expression of CD36, which in turn affects platelet function. To assess the clinical relevance of our findings we used the PhenoScanner tool, which aggregates large scale GWAS findings; the results reinforce the clinical relevance of our variants and the utility of the MPRA assay. The study demonstrates a generalizable paradigm for functional testing of genetic variants to inform mechanistic studies, support patient management and develop precision therapies.
SOD1 is commonly known for its ROS scavenging activity, but recent work has uncovered additional roles in modulating metabolism, maintaining redox balance, and regulating transcription. This new paradigm of expanded SOD1 function raises questions regarding the regulation of SOD1 and the cellular partitioning of its biological roles. Despite decades of research on SOD1, much of which focuses on its pathogenic role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, relatively little is known about its regulation by post-translational modifications (PTMs). However, over the last decade, advancements in mass spectrometry have led to a boom in PTM discovery across the proteome, which has also revealed new mechanisms of SOD1 regulation by PTMs and an array of SOD1 PTMs with high likelihood of biological function. In this review, we address emerging mechanisms of SOD1 regulation by post-translational modifications, many of which begin to shed light on how the various functions of SOD1 are regulated within the cell.
HMGCS2 is the rate-limiting enzyme of ketogenesis, which is vital for tumor initiation or metastasis. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between HMGCS2 and tumor angiogenesis.
CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 are important drug-metabolizing enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of around 30% of all medications. Importantly, the corresponding genes are highly polymorphic and these genetic differences contribute to interindividual and interethnic differences in drug pharmacokinetics, response, and toxicity. In this study we systematically analyzed the frequency distribution of clinically relevant CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 alleles across Europe based on data from 82,791 healthy individuals extracted from 79 original publications and, for the first time, provide allele confidence intervals for the general population. We found that frequencies of CYP2D6 gene duplications showed a clear South-East to North-West gradient ranging from <1% in Sweden and Denmark to 6% in Greece and Turkey. In contrast, an inverse distribution was observed for the loss-of-function alleles CYP2D6*4 and CYP2D6*5. Similarly, frequencies of the inactive CYP2C19*2 allele were graded from North-West to South-East Europe. In important contrast to previous work we found that the increased activity allele CYP2C19*17 was most prevalent in Central Europe (25-33%) with lower prevalence in Mediterranean-South Europeans (11-24%). In summary, we provide a detailed European map of common CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 variants and find that frequencies of the most clinically relevant alleles are geographically graded reflective of Europe's migratory history. These findings emphasize the importance of generating pharmacogenomic data sets with high spatial resolution to improve precision public health across Europe.
CA1 subregion of the hippocampal formation is one of the primarily affected structures in AD, yet not much is known about proteome alterations in the extracellular milieu of this region.
SLC6A14 (ATB
MIP and CPAF from Chlamydia have been shown to be effective in inducing immune responses important in clearing chlamydial infections. This study evaluates the protection conferred by MIP and CPAF as novel vaccines in pregnant C. abortus challenged ewes. Fifty C. abortus sero-negative sheep were randomly allocated into 5 groups of 10 according to the treatment they were to receive (1) 100 µg of MBP-MIP (2) 100 µg CPAF (3) 50 µg MBP-MIP and 50 µg CPAF (4) Tris-buffer (negative control) (5) Enzovax (positive control). Booster inoculations were administered 3 weeks after primary inoculations. Blood samples were taken pre-vaccination and weekly for 5 weeks. Five months after vaccination the ewes were mated. Pregnant ewes were then challenged on day 90 of gestation. Blood samples taken at four time-points post challenge were analysed for IFNγ levels, TNFα and IL-10 expression and anti-chlamydial antibody levels. Vaginal swabs, placental and foetal tissue and bacterial shedding were analysed using qPCR to quantify levels of C. abortus. Enzovax was 100% effective with no abortions occurring. The MIP/CPAF combined vaccine offered the greatest protection of the novel vaccines with 67% of ewes giving birth to one or more live lambs equating to a 50% vaccine efficacy rate. MIP and CPAF administered singly did not confer protection. Enzovax and MIP/CPAF vaccinated ewes had longer gestations and lambs with higher birth weights than negative control ewes. Aborting ewes shed higher numbers of C. abortus than ewes that had live lambs, all vaccinated ewes demonstrated lower levels of bacterial shedding than negative control ewes with Enzovax ewes shedding significantly fewer bacteria. Ewes that went on to abort had significantly higher levels of IFNγ and IL-10 at day 35 post challenge and significantly higher levels of anti-chlamydial antibodies at 24 h post lambing compared to ewes that had live lambs.
CD36 is a multifunctional glycoprotein, expressed in different types of cells and known to play a significant role in the pathophysiology of the host. The structural studies revealed that the scavenger receptor consists of short cytosolic domains, two transmembrane domains and a large ectodomain. The ectodomain serves as a receptor for a diverse number of endogenous and exogenous ligands. The CD36-specific ligands are involved in regulating the immune response during infectious and non-infectious diseases in the host. The role of CD36 in regulating the innate immune response during Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, Malaria, Leishmaniasis, HIV and Sepsis in a ligand-mediated fashion. Apart from infectious diseases, it is also considered to be involved in metabolic disorders such as Atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's, cancer and Diabetes. The ligand binding to scavenger receptor modulates the CD36 down-stream innate immune response, and it can be exploited to design suitable immuno-modulators. Hence, the current review focused on the role of the CD36 in innate immune response and therapeutic potentials of novel heterocyclic compounds as CD36 ligands during infectious and non-infectious diseases.
CD36 is a transmembrane protein involved in fatty acid translocation, scavenging for oxidized fatty acids acting as a receptor for adhesion molecules. It is expressed on macrophages, as well as other types of cells, such as endothelial and adipose cells. CD36 participates in muscle lipid uptake, adipose energy storage, and gut fat absorption. Recently, several preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated that upregulation of CD36 is a prerequisite for tumor metastasis. Cancer metastasis-related research emerged much later and has been less investigated, though it is equally or even more important. CD36 protein expression can be modified by epigenetic changes and post-transcriptional interference from non-coding RNAs. Some data indicate modulation of CD36 expression in specific cell types by epigenetic changes 
TK2 is a nuclear gene encoding the mitochondrial matrix protein thymidine kinase 2 (TK2), a critical enzyme in the mitochondrial nucleotide salvage pathway. Deficiency of TK2 activity causes mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, which in humans manifests predominantly as a mitochondrial myopathy with onset typically in infancy and childhood. We previously showed that oral treatment of the Tk2 H126N knock-in mouse model (Tk2
"ABO discrepancies are recognized when the reactions obtained in the forward type do not ""match"" the reactions obtained in the reverse type. Discrepant results are often caused by a variant ABO gene. Molecular analysis is required to confirm the type of subgroups and discrepancy. In this study ABO genotyping was performed on a series of blood donors and patients to determine their definite blood groups. We examined 100 samples with ABO discrepancies from blood donors and patients referred to Tehran Blood Transfusion Center between October 2015 and August 2016. ABO genotyping was performed on all samples with allele specific PCR for differentiation of A, B and O alleles. Exon 6 and 7 of ABO gene were sequenced to confirm the results. The genotyping of donor/patients samples with discrepant results of ABO blood typing consisted of 61 cases of A"
CDS1 is an enzyme required for the regeneration of the signaling molecule phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) from phosphatidic acid. These phosphoinositides and their cleavage products are a class of second messengers, which are involved in cell growth and oncogenesis. The role of CDS1 in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was explored.
COQ2 encodes para-hydroxybenzoate-polyprenyl transferase and, recently, mutations in this gene have been associated with the increase of the risk of multiple system atrophy (MSA) in Japanese cases. Subsequently, studies in Asian patients confirmed the role of COQ2 in the development of MSA, while other analysis failed to replicate these results in Caucasian population. We performed genetics screening of COQ2 in 100 MSA Italian patients. We did not find any pathogenic mutations; our results suggest that COQ2 is not a genetic risk factor for MSA in Italian population.
SETDB1 is a key histone lysine methyltransferase involved in gene silencing. The 
IVD degeneration is a widespread problem all over the world, which a variety of inflammatory cytokines have been implicated in, while Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is an important lipid mediator that may play a role in IVD degeneration.
PTEN deletion is associated with relapse after therapy for localized prostate cancer. There are limited data on PTEN loss as detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the risk of lethal disease after surgery.
SLC26A4 is the second most frequent gene implicated in congenital hearing loss after GJB2 mutations. Here, we report the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), from a patient who was carrying a homozygous c.919-2A>G variant in the SLC26A4 gene. This is the most common variant of SLC26A4 gene in the Chinese population and the second most prevalent one in other Asian countries. The established patient-derived iPSC displayed all the features of pluripotent stem cell markers and had the ability to differentiate into all of the three germ layers and possessed a normal karyotype.
EHMT2 (euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2), a histone methyltransferase, has been shown to be involved in multiple human cancers. In this study, we determined mRNA and protein expression of EHMT2 in cervical cancer cells and normal cervical epithelial cells. EHMT2 was inhibited with short hairpin RNA (shEHMT2) in cervical cancer cells. Cell viability, colony proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, and invasion assays and Western blot were performed to assess the function of EHMT2. As a result, EHMT2 was upregulated in human cervical cancer cells compared to normal cervical epithelial cells. Suppression of EHMT2 expression impairs cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. Furthermore, EHMT2 silencing inhibited cell adhesion and invasion. Finally, knockdown of EHMT2 resulted in a reduction of the expression of the tumorigenic proteins Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Survivin and in an increase in the expression of the anti-malignant protein E-cadherin. In conclusion, our data suggest that EHMT2 plays a key role in cell proliferation and metastatic capacity in cervical cancer cells and could serve as a potential therapeutic target.
ABO blood groups have been shown to be associated with different diseases. Very few studies have attempted to detect the association of ABO blood groups with obesity. The goal of this study is to find any potential relation between ABO blood groups and high body mass index (BMI) among a Saudi population, which may contribute to underlying genetic disorders.
GAPDH is emerging as a key player in T cell development and function. To investigate the role of GAPDH in T cells, we generated a transgenic mouse model overexpressing GAPDH in the T cell lineage. Aged mice developed a peripheral Tfh-like lymphoma that recapitulated key molecular, pathological, and immunophenotypic features of human angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL). GAPDH induced non-canonical NF-κB pathway activation in mouse T cells, which was strongly activated in human AITL. We developed a NIK inhibitor to reveal that targeting the NF-κB pathway prolonged AITL-bearing mouse survival alone and in combination with anti-PD-1. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of targeting NF-κB signaling in AITL and provide a model for future AITL therapeutic investigations.
CA1 hippocampal neurons are sensitive to ischemia. The erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma (Eph) receptors are a cell-cell contact signaling pathway for regulating neuron function and death. However, the mechanisms of EphA receptor in neuron death after ischemia remain unclear. In this study, we present evidence that outwardly rectifying chloride channels reside in CA1 hippocampal neurons. EphA4 receptor increased chloride channel currents. Moreover, the EphA4 receptor no longer had significant effects on enhanced channel currents following ischemia-reperfusion. Inhibition of EphA4 receptor with EphA4-Fc significantly decreased the channel currents after ischemia-reperfusion. These results suggest that the increased effect of the EphA4 receptor on the outwardly rectifying chloride channel activity in CA1 hippocampal neurons may provide better treatment for ischemic brain injury.
CA1 hippocampal neurons are sensitive to ischemia. The erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma (Eph) receptors are a cell-cell contact signaling pathway for regulating neuron function and death. However, the mechanisms of EphA receptor in neuron death after ischemia remain unclear. In this study, we present evidence that outwardly rectifying chloride channels reside in CA1 hippocampal neurons. EphA4 receptor increased chloride channel currents. Moreover, the EphA4 receptor no longer had significant effects on enhanced channel currents following ischemia-reperfusion. Inhibition of EphA4 receptor with EphA4-Fc significantly decreased the channel currents after ischemia-reperfusion. These results suggest that the increased effect of the EphA4 receptor on the outwardly rectifying chloride channel activity in CA1 hippocampal neurons may provide better treatment for ischemic brain injury.
CFTR encodes for a chloride ion channel expressed primarily in secretory epithelia in the airways, intestine, liver and other tissues. Mutations in the CFTR gene have been identified in people suffering from Cystic Fibrosis. Here, we established a CFTR knock-in reporter cell line from a human iPSC line (MHHi006-A) using TALEN technology. The reporter enables the monitoring and optimization of the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into CFTR expressing epithelia on a single cell level, as well as the enrichment of CFTR positive cells, which represent an excellent tool for Cystic Fibrosis disease modelling, drug screening and ultimately cellular therapies.
"PLA2G6 has been certified as a causative gene in patients with autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD). We reported an EOPD case caused by PLA2G6 gene mutation, and performed neurological examination, genetic analysis, and multimodal neuroimaging to describe this phenotype. A compound heterozygous mutation c.991G>T/c.1472+1G>A was detected in this patient. Heterozygous for the c.991G>T and c.1472+1G>A were separately detected in his parents. Pathogenicity of these two mutations were predicted according to the American college of medical genetics and genomics (ACMG) guideline. MRI assessment showed absence of bilateral ""swallow tail sign"" and cerebellar atrophy in this patient, while no obvious difference in brain iron accumulation between PLA2G6 mutant PD patient and healthy controls. Cerebellar abnormalities may be a marker for diagnosis and evaluation of PLA2G6 mutation Parkinsonism. However, the iron accumulation in PD may not be the result of PLA2G6 mutation."
ABCB1 is a member of the ATP binding cassette transporter family and high ABCB1 activity is considered as a poor prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with intensive chemotherapy, its direct relation with drug resistance remains unclear. We evaluated ABCB1 activity in relation with clinical parameters and treatment response to standard chemotherapy in 321 patients with de novo AML. We assessed multiple clinical relationships of ABCB1 activity-ex vivo drug resistance, gene expression, and the ABCB1 inhibitor quinine were evaluated. ABCB1 activity was observed in 58% of AML and was linked to low white blood cell count, high expression of CD34, absence of 
PTEN is a major tumor-suppressor protein whose expression and biological activity are frequently diminished in sporadic or inherited cancers. 
ACSL4 is a member of the ACSL family that catalyzes the conversion of long-chain fatty acids to acyl-coenzyme As, which are essential for fatty-acid incorporation and utilization in diverse metabolic pathways, including cholesteryl ester synthesis. Steroidogenic tissues such as the adrenal gland are particularly enriched in cholesteryl esters of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which constitute an important pool supplying cholesterol for steroid synthesis. The current studies addressed whether ACSL4 is required for normal steroidogenesis. CYP11A1 promoter‒mediated Cre was used to generate steroid tissue‒specific ACSL4 knockout (KO) mice. Results demonstrated that ACSL4 plays an important role in adrenal cholesteryl ester formation, as well as in determining the fatty acyl composition of adrenal cholesteryl esters, with ACSL4 deficiency leading to reductions in cholesteryl ester storage and alterations in cholesteryl ester composition. Statistically significant reductions in corticosterone and testosterone production, but not progesterone production, were observed in vivo, and these deficits were accentuated in ex vivo and in vitro studies of isolated steroid tissues and cells from ACSL4-deficient mice. However, these effects on steroid production appear to be due to reductions in cholesteryl ester stores rather than disturbances in signaling pathways. We conclude that ACSL4 is dispensable for normal steroidogenesis.
SLC5A8 is a sodium-coupled monocarboxylate and ketone transporter expressed in various epithelial cells. A putative role of SLC5A8 in neuroenergetics has been also hypothesized. To clarify this issue, we studied the cerebral phenotype of SLC5A8-deficient mice during aging. Elderly SLC5A8-deficient mice presented diffuse leukoencephalopathy characterized by intramyelinic oedema without demyelination suggesting chronic energetic crisis. Hypo-metabolism in the white matter of elderly SLC5A8-deficient mice was found using 
PDE9A is a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase expressed in neurons throughout the brain that has attracted attention as a therapeutic target to treat cognitive disorders. Indeed, PDE9A inhibitors are under evaluation in clinical trials as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. However, little is known about the cGMP signaling cascades regulated by PDE9A. Canonical cGMP signaling in brain follows the activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and the generation of nitric oxide, which activates soluble guanylyl cyclase and cGMP synthesis. However, we show that in mice, PDE9A regulates a pool of cGMP that is independent of nNOS, specifically, and nitric oxide signaling in general. This PDE9A-regulated cGMP pool appears to be highly compartmentalized and independent of cGMP pools regulated by several PDEs. These findings provide a new foundation for study of the upstream and downstream signaling elements regulated by PDE9A and its potential as a therapeutic target for brain disease.
ABO blood system has many subgroups. In A group, A
PNPLA3 rs738409 minor allele c.444G represents a risk factor for liver steatosis and fibrosis progression also in chronic hepatitis C (HCV). We investigated its impact on the timing of liver transplantation (LT) in patients with genotype 1b HCV cirrhosis.
CYP2C19 polymorphism is associated with pretreatment drug response prediction, metabolism, and disposition. Pakistan consists of a population comprising of various ethnic groups residing in different regions of the country each claiming diverse ethnic origins. The identification of CYP450 genotypic composition of these populations is therefore necessary to avoid adverse drug reactions in these individuals. The main objective of the study was to investigate the prevalence of CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*17 alleles in these ethnic groups. The study was conducted on one thousand and twenty-eight (n = 1028) healthy volunteers from nine ethnic groups of Pakistan namely Brusho (n = 28), Hazara (n = 102), Kalash (n = 64), Pathan (n = 170), Punjabi (n = 218), Saraiki (n = 59), Brahui (n = 118), Parsi (n = 90), and Sindhi (n = 179). DNA was extracted from leukocytes and analyzed by allele specific amplification polymerase chain reaction (ASA-PCR). Multi allelic polymorphism of CYP2C19 led to four distinct phenotypes identified as extensive metabolizer (EM), poor metabolizer (PM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), and ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM). Over all, the percentage of predicted poor metabolizer allele was 29.0% compared to UM allele (23.70%). Among the studied groups, Saraiki and Brahui showed highest percentage of PM allele (40%, 36%) whereas Parsi and Hazara had highest percentage of UM allele (37% and 30% respectively). In conclusion, the high allele frequency of PM (CYP2C19*2 and *17) in Pakistani population led to the recommendation of a pre-treatment test to monitor drug response and dosage (personalized medicine) to avoid post-treatment adverse drug reactions.
ACE inhibitors (ACEi) are common anti-hypertensive drugs that can cause angioedema. Though classic, or facial angioedema is rare, visceral angioedema is even less common. When angioedema occurs, it typically presents early, within 30 days of initiating therapy. Visceral angioedema most commonly presents with nausea, emesis, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, and thus is often mistaken for an episode of gastroenteritis. When a CT scan is obtained, it typically shows characteristic findings, including ascetic fluid, mild mesenteric oedema and thickening of the small bowel. In this case report, we present a patient who did not experience her first episode of visceral angioedema until after she had been on ACEi therapy for 5-7 years. In addition, she experienced recurrent episodes of visceral angioedema that were separated by approximately 4 years at a time. Both of these features make for a particularly unique presentation.
PTEN is frequently mutated in prostate cancer. The tumor suppressor function of PTEN is attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity that counters PI3K action. Here, we report a PTEN-ARID4B-PI3K axis in which PTEN inhibits expression of ARID4B, while ARID4B is a transcriptional activator of the PI3K subunit genes PIK3CA and PIK3R2 that are crucial for activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Reciprocal binding of ARID4B and histone H1 to the PIK3CA and PIK3R2 promoters modulates chromatin condensation, suggesting a mechanism by which ARID4B activates these promoters. Functional analyses reveals that ARID4B is required for prostate tumorigenesis when PTEN is deficient. The biological significance is further substantiated by the existence of a PTEN/ARID4B/PIK3CA three-gene signature that improves the predictive power for prostate cancer recurrence in patients. In summary, we identify ARID4B as a master regulator in the PTEN-PI3K pathway, thus providing a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer carrying PTEN mutations.
SETDB1 (SET Domain Bifurcated histone lysine methyltransferase 1) is a key lysine methyltransferase (KMT) required in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), where it silences transposable elements and DNA repeats 
PTEN is a tumour suppressor gene, and its loss of function is frequently observed in both heritable and sporadic cancers. It is involved in a great variety of biological processes, including maintenance of genomic stability, cell survival, migration, proliferation and metabolism. A better understanding of PTEN activity and regulation has therefore emerged as a subject of primary interest in cancer research. Gynaecological cancers are variously interested by PTEN deregulation and many perspective in terms of additional prognostic information and new therapeutic approaches can be explored. Here, we present the most significant findings on PTEN in gynaecological cancers (ovarian, endometrial, cervical, vulvar and uterine cancer) focusing on PTEN alterations incidence, biological role and clinical implications.
G6PD enzyme deficiency is a common enzymatic X-linked disorder. Deficiency of the G6PD enzyme can cause free radical-mediated oxidative damage to red blood cells, leading to premature haemolysis. Treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria with primaquine poses a potential risk of mild to severe acute haemolytic anaemia in G6PD deficient people. In this study, the prevalence and distribution of G6PD mutations were investigated across broad areas of Ethiopia, and tested the association between G6PD genotype and phenotype with the goal to provide additional information relevant to the use of primaquine in malaria treatment.
CD38 is a multifunctional cell surface molecule that plays a crucial role in B cell activation, differentiation, and maturation in mammals with an increased expression in B cell maturation. In this study, a CD38-like molecule (OnCD38) was cloned and identified from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and its functional characterization was investigated. The open reading frame of OnCD38 is 828 bp of the nucleotide sequence, encoding a polypeptide of 275 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of OnCD38 is highly homologous to other teleost fish and similar to mammals, containing extracellular, intracellular and transmembrane regions. Subcellular localization studies revealed that OnCD38 molecules were presented on the surface of B cells. Three healthy tilapia were used in each experimental group and control group. Following keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) challenge in vivo, the mRNA expression of OnCD38 was significantly up-regulated in peripheral blood, spleen, and head kidney, with an earlier up-regulation in the second challenge than the first one. The up-regulation of OnCD38 expression was also detected in head kidney leukocytes after stimulation with LPS, recombinant HomoIL-10 ((r)HomoIL-10), (r)OnIL-10, and LPS plus (r)OnIL-10 in vitro. Furthermore, the OnCD38 expression increased with the differentiation of B cells, reaching a high level (10.1 fold higher than resting mature B cells) at the plasma-like B cells. Taken together, in this study, these results indicate that the OnCD38 is likely involved in the T cell-dependent response and plays roles in B cell differentiation in Nile tilapia.
PYCR1 exerts an important role in various cancers, but its effect on colorectal cancer (CRC) and the potential mechanism remain to be clarified. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of PYCR1 on CRC and further explore the special molecular mechanism. The expression of PYCR1 in CRC tissues and cells was analysed by RT-PCR assay. Cell proliferation was explored using an MTT assay. A CoIP assay was performed to determine the binding activity of PYCR1 and STAT3. Western blot was used to measure the protein expression of P-gp, MRP1, E-cadherin and vimentin. The results revealed that PYCR1 is highly expressed in CRC tissues and cells. PYCR1-siRNA inhibited the proliferation, drug resistance and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells. The CoIP assay result demonstrated that PYCR1 interacts directly with STAT3, and STAT3 overexpression partly reverses the effect of PYCR1 on proliferation, drug resistance and EMT of CRC cells. What is more, si-PYCR1 inhibited STAT3-mediated p38 MAPK and NF-κB signalling pathways. Collectively, it suggests that knockdown of PYCR1 inhibits proliferation, drug resistance and EMT potentially by regulating STAT3-mediated p38 MAPK and NF-κB signalling pathways in CRC cells.
PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) is a highly variable autosomal dominant condition associated with intellectual disability, overgrowth, and tumor predisposition phenotypes, which often overlap. PHTS incorporates a number of historical clinical presentations including Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, Cowden syndrome, and a macrocephaly-autism/developmental delay syndrome. Many reviews in the literature focus on PHTS as an adult hamartoma and malignancy predisposition condition. Here, we review the current literature with a focus on pediatric presentations. The review starts with a summary of the main conditions encompassed within PHTS. We then discuss PHTS diagnostic criteria, and clinical features. We briefly address rarer PTEN associations, and the possible role of mTOR inhibitors in treatment. We acknowledge the limited understanding of the natural history of childhood-onset PHTS as a cancer predisposition syndrome and present a summary of important management considerations.
NAMPT is a biomarker for endothelial dysfunction, but its relationship with nitrite (marker of NO formation) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT-1) has not been previously evaluated in preeclampsia. Therefore, we measured plasma NAMPT and sFLT-1 levels using enzyme immunoassays and plasma nitrite concentrations using an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay. NAMPT was positively correlated to nitrite (r = 0.217; P = 0.034) and inversely related to sFLT-1 (r = -0.340; P = 0.029) in healthy pregnant women, but inversely related to nitrite (r = -0.259; P = 0.035) and positively correlated to sFLT-1 (r = 0.326; P = 0.007) in preeclamptic patients, suggesting that NAMPT inhibits NO formation and interacts with the antiangiogenic factor sFLT-1 in preeclampsia.
ALDH1L1 (10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase), an enzyme of folate metabolism highly expressed in liver, metabolizes 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to produce tetrahydrofolate (THF). This reaction might have a regulatory function towards reduced folate pools, de novo purine biosynthesis, and the flux of folate-bound methyl groups. To understand the role of the enzyme in cellular metabolism, Aldh1l1
TYRP1 mRNA is of interest due to its potential non-coding role as a sponge sequestering tumor-suppressive miRs in melanoma. To our knowledge, there is no report on changes in TYRP1 expression in melanomas after development of resistance to targeted therapies. We used patient-derived drug-naïve RAS
CD38 is expressed on the surface of many immune cells, which are closely associated with antitumor immunity and immune tolerance of tumor cells. Therefore, monitoring CD38 expression has gained great attention for tracking the progression of tumors and cancer treatment. Herein, we aim to develop a PET tracer using an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (daratumumab) to monitor CD38 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, daratumumab was radiolabeled with 
LIPA (lysosomal acid lipase) mediates cholesteryl ester hydrolysis, and patients with rare loss-of-function mutations develop hypercholesterolemia and severe disease. Genome-wide association studies of coronary artery disease have identified several tightly linked, common intronic risk variants in 
GBA variants are the most common genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD) world-wide, and can be found in up to 20% of Ashkenazi PD patients. The E326K variant, which is not considered a Gaucher's disease causing mutation, was recently shown to increase the risk for PD. Since E326K is a common variant among Europeans, Finnish and Ashkenazi (2.4, 8.6 and 1.2% carrier rate, respectively), we aimed to refine its involvement in PD.
ABO blood group antigens are expressed on von Willebrand factor (VWF) and glycosylation patterns influence circulating VWF levels. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of ABO blood type on tissue-associated VWF protein levels. We selected 35 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pulmonary tissue blocks obtained at autopsy from decedents who died from pulmonary embolism with known ABO blood groups (O, A, B and AB phenotypes), prepared tissue microarrays (TMAs) and stained TMAs with antibodies to VWF and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion marker-1 (PECAM-1) as a marker of endothelial cells. A pixel count scoring algorithm was used to quantify VWF and PECAM-1 staining intensity in pulmonary arterioles in digitised images. Compared with type O, non-O individuals have a significantly higher amount of endothelial cell-associated VWF protein expression. VWF protein levels associated with pulmonary vascular endothelial cells is influenced by ABO antigenic determinants.
COX7A1 is a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, and plays an important role in the super-assembly that integrates peripherally into multi-unit heteromeric complexes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. In recent years, some researchers have identified that COX7A1 is implicated in human cancer cell metabolism and therapy. In this study, we mainly explored the effect of COX7A1 on the cell viability of lung cancer cells. COX7A1 overexpression was induced by vector transfection in NCI-H838 cells. Cell proliferation, colony formation and cell apoptosis were evaluated in different groups. In addition, autophagy was analyzed by detecting the expression level of p62 and LC3, as well as the tandem mRFP-GFP-LC3 reporter assay respectively. Our results indicated that the overexpression of COX7A1 suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation ability, and promoted cell apoptosis in human non-small cell lung cancer cells. Besides, the overexpression of COX7A1 blocked autophagic flux and resulted in the accumulation of autophagosome via downregulation of PGC-1α and upregulation of NOX2. Further analysis showed that the effect of COX7A1 overexpression on cell viability was partly dependent of the inhibition of autophagy. Herein, we identified that COX7A1 holds a key position in regulating the development and progression of lung cancer by affecting autophagy. Although the crosstalk among COX7A1, PGC-1α and NOX2 needs further investigation, our study provides a novel insight into the therapeutic action of COX7A1 against human non-small cell lung cancer.
NDUFAB1 is the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACP) essential for cell viability. Through its pantetheine-4'-phosphate post-translational modification, NDUFAB1 interacts with members of the leucine-tyrosine-arginine motif (LYRM) protein family. Although a number of LYRM proteins have been described to participate in a variety of defined processes, the functions of others remain either partially or entirely unknown. We profiled the interaction network of NDUFAB1 to reveal associations with 9 known LYRM proteins as well as more than 20 other proteins involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex and mitochondrial ribosome assembly. Subsequent knockout and interaction network studies in human cells revealed the LYRM member AltMiD51 to be important for optimal assembly of the large mitoribosome subunit, consistent with recent structural studies. In addition, we used proteomics coupled with topographical heat-mapping to reveal that knockout of LYRM2 impairs assembly of the NADH-dehydrogenase module of complex I, leading to defects in cellular respiration. Together, this work adds to the catalogue of functions executed by LYRM family of proteins in building mitochondrial complexes and emphasises the common and essential role of NDUFAB1 as a protagonist in mitochondrial metabolism.
G6PD deficiency results from numerous mutations in the G6PD gene and can cause alterations in enzyme function up to varying degrees. P. vivax malaria infections require G6PD deficiency screening because of the potential risk of haemolysis by the gametocytocidal drug (primaquine) during the radical treatment. The present study investigated the incidence of G6PD deficiency from northeast India and further, molecular characterization was performed. During 2014-16, a total of 1,015 patients from four north-eastern states of India (Tripura, Mizoram, Meghalaya & Arunachal Pradesh), were screened for G6PD deficiency, using Beutler's fluorescence spot test (FST) and confirmed with SPAN G6PD kit. The deficient individuals (55/1015, 5.4%) were further characterized by PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing except one case of lost to follow up. As observed by FST, the frequency of G6PD deficient males (42/538, 7.8%) were found to be higher than females (13/477, 2.73%), (p < 0.0001). Two non-synonymous mutations; G6PD-D (Mahidol)
SETD1B is a component of a histone methyltransferase complex that specifically methylates Lys-4 of histone H3 (H3K4) and is responsible for the epigenetic control of chromatin structure and gene expression. De novo microdeletions encompassing this gene as well as de novo missense mutations were previously linked to syndromic intellectual disability (ID). Here, we identify a specific hypermethylation signature associated with loss of function mutations in the SETD1B gene which may be used as an epigenetic marker supporting the diagnosis of syndromic SETD1B-related diseases. We demonstrate the clinical utility of this unique epi-signature by reclassifying previously identified SETD1B VUS (variant of uncertain significance) in two patients.
SMS text appointment reminders reduce non-attendance rates in outpatient paediatric settings. The potential effect on late cancellation rates, however, has not been assessed. The aim of the present study was to assess if SMS text messaging reminders affect non-attendance and late cancellation rates in a secondary paediatric outpatient centre.
KMT2A rearranged (KMT2Ar) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a high-risk genomic subtype, with long-term survival rates of less than 60% across all age groups. These cases present a complex clinical challenge, with a high incidence in infants, high-risk clinical features and propensity for aggressive relapse. KMT2A rearrangements are highly pathogenic leukaemic drivers, reflected by the high incidence of KMT2Ar ALL in infants, who carry few leukaemia-associated cooperative mutations. However, transgenic murine models of KMT2Ar ALL typically exhibit long latency and mature or mixed phenotype, and fail to recapitulate the aggressive disease observed clinically. Next-generation sequencing has revealed that KMT2Ar ALL also occurs in adolescents and adults, and potentially cooperative genomic lesions such as PI3K-RAS pathway variants are present in KMT2Ar patients of all ages. This review addresses the aetiology of KMT2Ar ALL, with a focus on the cell of origin and mutational landscape, and how genomic profiling of KMT2Ar ALL patients in the era of next-generation sequencing demonstrates that KMT2Ar ALL is a complex heterogenous disease. Ultimately, understanding the underlying biology of KMT2Ar ALL will be important in improving long-term outcomes for these high-risk patients.
"GUCA1A gene variants are associated with autosomal dominant (AD) cone dystrophy (COD) and cone-rod dystrophy (CORD). GUCA1A-associated AD-COD/CORD has never been reported in the Japanese population. The purpose of this study was to investigate clinical and genetic features of GUCA1A-associated AD-COD/CORD from a large Japanese cohort. We identified 8 variants [c.C50_80del (p.E17VfsX22), c.T124A (p.F42I), c.C204G (p.D68E), c.C238A (p.L80I), c.T295A (p.Y99N), c.A296C (p.Y99S), c.C451T (p.L151F), and c.A551G (p.Q184R)] in 14 families from our whole exome sequencing database composed of 1385 patients with inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) from 1192 families. Three variants (p.Y99N, p.Y99S, and p.L151F), which are located on/around EF-hand domains 3 and 4, were confirmed as ""pathogenic"", whereas the other five variants, which did not co-segregate with IRDs, were considered ""non-pathogenic"". Ophthalmic findings of 9 patients from 3 families with the pathogenic variants showed central visual impairment from early to middle-age onset and progressive macular atrophy. Electroretinography revealed severely decreased or non-recordable cone responses, whereas rod responses were highly variable, ranging from nearly normal to non-recordable. Our results indicate that the three pathogenic variants, two of which were novel, underlie AD-COD/CORD with progressive retinal atrophy, and the prevalence (0.25%, 3/1192 families) of GUCA1A-associated IRDs may be low among Japanese patients."

CFTR function measurements in intestinal organoids may help to better characterise individual disease expression in F508del homozygous people. Our objective was to study correlations between CFTR function as measured with forskolin-induced swelling in rectal organoids with clinical parameters in adult patients with homozygous F508del mutations.
PIK3CA is the most frequently mutated gene in HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Prognostic implications of such mutations remain unknown. We sought to elucidate the clinical significance of PIK3CA mutations in HPV-associated OPSCC patients treated with definitive chemoradiation (CRT). Seventy-seven patients with HPV-associated OPSCC were enrolled on two phase II clinical trials of de-intensified CRT (60 Gy intensity-modulated radiotherapy with concurrent weekly cisplatin). Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed. Nine of 77 patients had disease recurrence (2 regional, 4 distant, 3 regional and distant). Thirty-four patients had mutation(s) identified; 16 had PIK3CA mutations. Patients with wild-type-PIK3CA had statistically significantly higher 3-year disease-free survival than PIK3CA-mutant patients (93.4% [95% CI 85.0-99.9%] vs. 68.8% [95% CI 26.7-89.8%]; p = 0.004. On multivariate analysis, PIK3CA mutation was the only variable statistically significantly associated with disease recurrence (HR 5.71 [95% CI 1.53, 21.3], p = 0.01). PIK3CA mutation is associated with worse disease-free survival in a prospective cohort of newly diagnosed HPV-associated OPSCC patients treated with de-intensified CRT.
CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein with ectoenzymatic activity involved in regulation of migration, signal transduction, and receptor-mediated adhesion. CD38 is highly expressed on various malignant cells, including multiple myeloma (MM), and at relatively low levels in other tissues, making it a suitable target for therapeutic antibodies. Several anti-CD38 therapies have been, or are being, developed for the treatment of MM, including daratumumab and isatuximab (SAR650984), respectively. Studies have shown that anti-CD38 therapies are effective in the treatment of relapsed/refractory MM and are well tolerated, with infusion reactions being the most common side effects. They can be used as monotherapy or in combination with immunomodulatory agents, such as pomalidomide, or proteasome inhibitors to potentiate their activity. Here we examine isatuximab and several anti-CD38 agents in development that were generated using new antibody engineering techniques and that may lead to more effective CD38 targeting. We also summarize trials assessing these antibodies in MM, other malignancies, and solid organ transplantation. Finally, we propose that further research on the mechanisms of resistance to anti-CD38 therapy and the development of biomarkers and new backbone regimens with CD38 antibodies will be important steps in building more personalized treatment for patients with MM.
CD38 is a multifunctional cell surface protein endowed with receptor/enzymatic functions. The protein is generally expressed at low/intermediate levels on hematological tissues and some solid tumors, scoring the highest levels on plasma cells (PC) and PC-derived neoplasia. CD38 was originally described as a receptor expressed by activated cells, mainly T lymphocytes, wherein it also regulates cell adhesion and cooperates in signal transduction mediated by major receptor complexes. Furthermore, CD38 metabolizes extracellular NAD
GNE myopathy is a rare, predominantly distal myopathy, involving mainly the lower limbs and presenting with gait disturbances. In this cross-sectional study gait evaluation of 23 (14 men) genetically confirmed GNE myopathy patients was done using Instrumented walkway analysis (GAITRite®) along with video gait capture. We recorded the topographical pattern of muscles involvement in lower limbs and correlated Functional Ambulation Profile-FAP and Medical Research council-MRC grading of lower limb scores with duration of illness. Early foot flat, foot drop gait with wider out-toed stance and higher perturbations with increased pressure at heel and decreased arm swing were noted. Muscle topography showed predominant weakness in ankle dorsi-flexors, flexor hallucis longus, extensor hallucis longus, hip adductors and knee flexors with stark sparing of quadriceps and relative sparing of hip- abductors, extensors, flexors and ankle plantar-flexors. Gait parameters in women were significantly more affected than men (p < 0.05) for the same duration of illness. FAP score and MRC grading of lower limb scores correlated significantly with duration of illness (p < 0.05). We observed that ankle dorsiflexors were affected earliest with sparing of quadriceps muscles in these patients.
ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn (ABO-HDN), which may cause neonatal jaundice and polycythemia, or even stillbirth or neonatal death, is widespread in China. Prenatal testing for the fetal ABO blood group can reduce unnecessary concerns or ensure prompt treatment. Herein, we presented a method to employ high-density silica microbeads (SiO
ABO blood group has been associated with cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, whether ABO blood group is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unknown. The present study aimed to clarify this issue.
CYP4B1 is an enigmatic mammalian cytochrome P450 monooxygenase acting at the interface between xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism. A prominent CYP4B1 substrate is the furan pro-toxin 4-ipomeanol (IPO). Our recent investigation on metabolism of IPO related compounds that maintain the furan functionality of IPO while replacing its alcohol group with alkyl chains of varying structure and length revealed that, in addition to cytotoxic reactive metabolite formation (resulting from furan activation) non-cytotoxic ω-hydroxylation at the alkyl chain can also occur. We hypothesized that substrate reorientations may happen in the active site of CYP4B1. These findings prompted us to re-investigate oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and fatty alcohols with C9-C16 carbon chain length by CYP4B1. Strikingly, we found that besides the previously reported ω- and ω-1-hydroxylations, CYP4B1 is also capable of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-fatty acid hydroxylation. In contrast, fatty alcohols of the same chain length are exclusively hydroxylated at ω, ω-1, and ω-2 positions. Docking results for the corresponding CYP4B1-substrate complexes revealed that fatty acids can adopt U-shaped bonding conformations, such that carbon atoms in both arms may approach the heme-iron. Quantum chemical estimates of activation energies of the hydrogen radical abstraction by the reactive compound 1 as well as electron densities of the substrate orbitals led to the conclusion that fatty acid and fatty alcohol oxidations by CYP4B1 are kinetically controlled reactions.
CYP2C19 and CYP3A are the main enzymes involved in omeprazole metabolism, while CYP3A is the principal enzyme family for amlodipine biotransformation. Concomitant use of these drugs in patients with hypertension and acid-related disorders (ARD) might lead to drug-drug interaction.
"PAH clusters are one candidate species for the interstellar ""very small grains"" or ""VSGs"", i.e., dust grains small enough to be stochastically heated and contribute to the aromatic infrared emission bands (AIBs). This possibility motivated laboratory experiments on the infrared spectroscopy of PAH clusters using matrix isolation spectroscopy. The spectral shifts due to PAH clustering in argon matrices provide clues for the AIB contribution from PAH clusters in the interstellar medium. Here we review results from a number of small PAH species, extrapolation to the much larger PAHs believed to be present in the interstellar medium, and the implications for a PAH cluster contribution to the VSG population."
P4HA2 is one of collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H) isoform and increased in several types of human cancer. However, the role of P4HA2 during cervical tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we report that the protein level of P4HA2 is significantly increased in cervical cancer tissues. Silencing of P4HA2 inhibits cervical cancer cell proliferation, colony formation and migration. We also demonstrate decreased glucose uptake and lactate production in P4HA2 knockdown cells. Mechanistically, P4HA2 promotes cervical cancer cell glycolysis through upregulation of PGK1 and LDHA. We find a positive correlation between P4HA2 and PGK1/LDHA expression in cervical cancer tissues. Importantly, high expression of P4HA2, PGK1 or LDHA has a significantly shorter overall survival period and the survival prediction is enhanced by using combination of P4HA2 and PGK1/LDHA expression. Collectively, we identify P4HA2 as a regulator of glycolysis through PGK1 and LDHA, which may serve as a potential therapeutic target for cervical cancer.
ABO blood group has been associated with various disease phenotypes. However, ABO blood group to influence patients in risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) and arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) remains controversial after evaluation in several reports. To fully assess effects of ABO blood group on VTEs and ATEs, we conducted a cross-sectional study and investigated the interaction between blood group and age, and between blood group and sex on the prevalence of VTEs and ATEs. In addition, the effect of blood group on ATEs in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) was observed. Detailed information of 7830 patients was collected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between blood group and VTEs, pulmonary embolism (PE) and myocardial infarction (MI). In those 7830 patients, the respective risk of VTEs and PE was higher for patients with blood group A compared with blood group O individually. In those 6713 patients with rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, constrictive pericarditis, or valvular heart disease excluded, blood group A was associated with the risk of MI. For VTEs, PE, and MI, blood group also exhibited significant interactions with sex and age, although there was no evidence of interaction between blood group and age for VTEs. In addition, interactions among blood group, age, and AF for the ATEs were observed. Similar to prior population studies an association of ABO blood group with susceptibility to VTEs and MI was found. Age and sex may modulate the association between ABO blood group and these thromboembolic diseases.
PTEN is the most commonly inactivated tumor suppressor gene in primary prostate cancer (PCa) and its loss is associated with poor clinical outcomes. ERG rearrangement is a genomic alteration frequently found in PCa and its prognostic significance has yielded mixed results. Although the association of PTEN and ERG biomarkers has potential impact on clinical outcomes, studies examining the two genes simultaneously are scarce in Brazilian populations. In this study, we retrospectively examined the relationship between ERG expression and PTEN loss in 119 surgically treated prostate cancer patients from Northeastern Brazil through immunohistochemical analysis. ERG expression was found in 41.0% (48/117) of cases and the loss of PTEN detected in 38.1% (40/105) of samples. ERG-positive cases were significantly associated with lower prostate weight; ERG negatively correlated with Gleason score above 6. The lack of associations for PTEN loss alone in this cohort is counter to the literature, which shows that PTEN loss is usually associated with more aggressive disease. The overlapping of the two biomarkers revealed that samples with positive ERG expression without PTEN loss were associated with lower Gleason and lower Grade group. This study contributes with the discussion about the development of the molecular profiling of prostate cancer. The further development of similar studies could help in stratifying specific risk groups, leading to a more personalized therapeutic decision for prostate cancer treatment.
ACLY links energy metabolism provided by catabolic pathways to biosynthesis. ACLY, which has been found to be overexpressed in many cancers, converts citrate into acetyl-CoA and OAA. The first of these moleculessupportsprotein acetylation, in particular that of histone, and de novo lipid synthesis, and the last one sustains the production of aspartate (required for nucleotide and polyamine synthesis) and the regeneration of NADPH,H
IDH1 mutations are closely related to the development and progression of various human cancers, such as glioblastoma, sarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. By screening dozens of reported natural compounds using both wild-type and mutant IDH1 enzymatic assays, we discovered Licochalcone A is a selective inhibitor to the R132C-mutant IDH1 with an IC
UGT1A4 and UGT2B10 are the human UGT isoforms most frequently involved in N-glucuronidation of drugs. UGT2B10 exhibits higher affinity than UGT1A4 for numerous substrates making it potentially the more important enzyme for these compounds in vivo. Clinically relevant UGT2B10 polymorphisms, including a null activity splice site mutation common in African populations, can lead to large exposure differences for UGT2B10 substrates that may limit their developability as marketed drugs. UGT phenotyping approaches using recombinantly expressed UGTs are limited by low enzyme activity and lack of validation of scaling to in vivo. In this study we describe the use of an efficient experimental protocol for UGT2B10 selective substrate identification, which exploits the activity difference between pooled HLM and HLM from a phenotypically UGT2B10 poor metabolizer donor. Following characterization of the approach with eight known UGT2B10 substrates, we used ligand-based virtual screening and literature precedents to select 24 potential UGT2B10 substrates out of 140 UGT-metabolized drugs for testing. Of these, dothiepin, cidoxepin, cyclobenzaprine, azatadine, cyproheptadine, bifonazole, and asenapine were indicated to be selective UGT2B10 substrates which have not previously been described. UGT phenotyping experiments and tests comparing conjugative and oxidative clearance were then used to confirm these findings. These approaches provide rapid and sensitive ways to evaluate whether a potential drug candidate cleared via glucuronidation will be sensitive to UGT2B10 polymorphisms in vivo. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The role of highly polymorphic UGT2B10 is likely to be underestimated currently for many compounds cleared via N-glucuronidation due to high test concentrations often used in vitro and low activity of UGT2B10 preparations. The methodology described in this study can be combined with the assessment of UGT vs oxidative in vitro metabolism to rapidly identify compounds likely to be sensitive to UGT2B10 polymorphism, enabling either chemical modification or prospective exposure polymorphism risk assessment to be performed before candidate selection.
